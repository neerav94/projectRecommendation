Android is an open source full stack platform for developing applications for android based
mobile phones. The wide spread usage of Android requires some areas for potential researchers.
Mobility management, location awareness and security are among them. Vulnerability of theft
exists as these phones are portable devices. This has opened new opportunities in the field of
security of android based mobile phones. A cost effective technique is needed to protect phones
using existing resources. Location based services is one of such technique that can provide the
protection for smart phones with minimal cost investment. The currently available technique for
providing location is GPS, but GPS does not work well at indoor locations for providing locations,
so WI-FI signal strength can be used to find the indoor location. This viewpoint can be thus used
as a medium to track the phone. An application is developed that can be used for securing
android based smartphones in a particular area. It is an effective security application that uses
WI-FI signal strength as a parameter to inform location changes. It uses SMS service to inform
about the stolen device. The application is suitable for identifying position in indoor locations so
that mobile phone can become theft free.

an open and free software stack that includes
an operating system, middleware and also key
applications  for  use  on  mobile  devices,
including Smartphone. It is an Open Handset
Alliance Project. Android has gained popularity
in recent years due to its features. Android
includes API’s for Location Based Services
(LBS),  GSM  and  3G  EDGE  networks  for
telephony, IPC message passing, background
processes  and  applications.  There  is  no
charge for licensing, distribution and release
approval as well.

Security for Android mobile phone is an
important issue these days. A lot of research
work is going on for security of these phones.
Since, Android phone  is  a small  handheld
moveable device therefore use of positioning
system  is  one  of  the  ways  to  incorporate
security in it (Laoudias et al., 2012).

Security using positioning system can be
provided  for  indoor  as  well  as  outdoor
locations.  Some  technologies  are  already
available  that  can  deliver  high  level  of
positioning accuracy for security. As far as
security is concerned, cost is major issue. They
require  equipment  such  as  antennas  and
transmitters.  This  necessitate  expensive
infrastructure. It is also time consuming and
non-flexible (Mahajan et al., 2012). Thus a cost
effective  technique  is  needed  to  protect
phones using existing resources.

It  leads  to  requirement  of  a  security
technique  that  uses  existing  resource  for
positioning  of  indoor  location.  One  of  the
solutions is use of WI-FI positioning system.
WI-FI signals are used for getting location in
WI-FI positioning system. The locations are
assigned against  particular signal  strength
received from WI-FI (Shin et al., 2010).

There  are  certain  issues  with  android
phones that are required to be overcome in
providing  security  using  WI-FI  positioning
system.  The  issues  are  related  to  power
consumption  of  battery  and  starting  the
application remotely. These two issues are
very much related to each other, i.e., if one
application can start remotely then there is no
need to run it all the time and due to this power
consumption is also reduced.

The proposed work has chosen security
aspect of mobile devices as a major concern.
It proposes an algorithm for providing location
and security using WI-FI signal strength. SMS
service is used to communicate about the
stolen device.
RELATED  WORK
A  lot  of  research  work  is  available  on

explains about the various methods that can
be  used  to  implement  positioning  system.
Indoor WI-FI positioning system for android
based  smart  phone  (Shin et  al.,  2012)

Security for Android mobile phone is an
important issue these days. A lot of research
work is going on for security of these phones.
Since, Android phone  is  a small  handheld
moveable device therefore use of positioning
system  is  one  of  the  ways  to  incorporate
security in it (Laoudias et al., 2012).

Security using positioning system can be
provided  for  indoor  as  well  as  outdoor
locations.  Some  technologies  are  already
available  that  can  deliver  high  level  of
positioning accuracy for security. As far as
security is concerned, cost is major issue. They
require  equipment  such  as  antennas  and
transmitters.  This  necessitate  expensive
infrastructure. It is also time consuming and
non-flexible (Mahajan et al., 2012). Thus a cost
effective  technique  is  needed  to  protect
phones using existing resources.

It  leads  to  requirement  of  a  security
technique  that  uses  existing  resource  for
positioning  of  indoor  location.  One  of  the
solutions is use of WI-FI positioning system.
WI-FI signals are used for getting location in
WI-FI positioning system. The locations are
assigned against  particular signal  strength
received from WI-FI (Shin et al., 2010).

There  are  certain  issues  with  android
phones that are required to be overcome in
providing  security  using  WI-FI  positioning
system.  The  issues  are  related  to  power
consumption  of  battery  and  starting  the
application remotely. These two issues are
very much related to each other, i.e., if one
application can start remotely then there is no
need to run it all the time and due to this power
consumption is also reduced.

The proposed work has chosen security
aspect of mobile devices as a major concern.
It proposes an algorithm for providing location
and security using WI-FI signal strength. SMS
service is used to communicate about the
stolen device.
RELATED  WORK
A  lot  of  research  work  is  available  on
positioning  systems.  The  available  work
explains about the various methods that can
be  used  to  implement  positioning  system.
Indoor WI-FI positioning system for android
based  smart  phone  (Shin et  al.,  2012)
proposed the applications that include position
related jobs, general survey regarding signal
strength patterns, decision based on signal
strength information for indoor location.

A  system  based  on  Location  Based
Service (Laoudias et al., 2012) locates the
position  of  a  user.  It  relies  on  ubiquitous
WLANs and exploits Received Signal Strength
(RSS)  values  from  neighbouring Access
Points (AP) that are constantly monitored by
the mobile devices under normal operation.
An Analysis of Wi-Fi Based Indoor Positioning
Accuracy (Papliatseyeu et al., 2009) suggests
examining  several  aspects  of  location
fingerprinting based indoor positioning that

affect positioning accuracy. A similar work on
an indoor localization application (Martin et al.,
2010) presented a precise Indoor localization
using smart phone leveraging their sensing
capabilities. It implemented the approach for
the  statistical  processing  of  radio  signal
strengths, to justify its performance better than
other deterministic techniques.

Wi-Fi Localization using RSSI in Indoor
Environment via a Smartphone (Shin et al.,
2012) is also suggested in past. It suggested
the use of Wi-Fi network to localize a mobile
user in an indoor environment. Their system
used  the  inverse  relationship  between
Distance  and  RSSI  and  showed  the
improvement in finding the correct match for
the fingerprinting by incorporating database
correlation  algorithms  such  as  K  nearest
neighbours and probabilistic algorithms.
PROPOSED  ALGORITHM
The RSS (received signal strength) from WI-
FI access point is measured three times and
stored in the proposed algorithm (Figure 1).
The abbreviations of symbol used are given
in Table 1. The threshold value is calculated
according to signal strength and signals from
previously  stored  signals,  are  selected  to
provide input.

CONCLUSION
Indoor LBS on smart phones have had great
success in the commercial buildings such as
mall providing useful functionalities such as
finding  nearby  point-of-interest.  Next-
generation Indoor LBS promise to deliver even
more interactive services to users and create
a huge knowledge-base of location-tagged
information. The major technological reasons
for this advancement are better WI-FI signal
strength  and  better  signal  access  through
mobiles.

service that supports context aware computing
by providing clients with information about
location  object  and  securing  the  object.  It
provides an indoor WI-FI positioning system

The existing solution for indoor localization
needs a complex hardware implementation.
In future it can be reduced by introducing the

make use of hardware embedded within the

• Calculate  difference  between  scanned

signals and mean.

• Store difference at R’j.
• Calculate square of difference, R’j * R’j.
• Store at Rsi.
• Calculate mean of Rsi and store at Rm2.
• Find  square  root  of  Rm2  and  call  it

Threshold.

• Select the signal whose mean difference

with Rm is less than threshold.

• Again calculate the mean and call it rms

(root mean square) value.

• Fetch the location from database according

to this rms value.

EXPERIMENTAL  SETUP  AND
ENVIRONMENTAL
ENVIRONMENT
The experiment was carried out with an android
phone and a WI-FI access point (Figure 2) in a
floor of MTech lab which locates in School of
Computer Science, DAVV Indore. Three points
are selected for location and rms values for
each selected points are stored in database.
Database hence contains  the  location  and
corresponding value of rms to each location.

its value with the previously stored special
code. The application starts scanning WI-FI
signal, if the code matches.

The execution of the application generates
an interface for (Figure 3) scanning the signal.
It shows “get get” message as well. Here the
first  “get”  is  the  stored  code  for  starting
application and the second “get” is the code
sent through SMS to start application.

Figure 4a shows scanning of signal for the
first time from access point (Davv-8023). The
signal strength of –77 is calculated for this
experiment.  Figure  4b  shows  scanning  of
signal  for  the  second  time  from  the  same
access  point  (Davv-8023).  Signal  strength
value of –71 is measured in the second time.
Figure 4c shows scanning of signal third time
from the same access point (Davv-8023) and
signal strength calculated is –78.

IMPLEMENTATION
The implemented application is installed in an
android device (ICS: Ice cream Sandwich).
Application is started by sending an SMS to
android device. The application on receiving
SMS extracts the SMS contents and compares

CONCLUSION
Indoor LBS on smart phones have had great
success in the commercial buildings such as
mall providing useful functionalities such as
finding  nearby  point-of-interest.  Next-
generation Indoor LBS promise to deliver even
more interactive services to users and create
a huge knowledge-base of location-tagged
information. The major technological reasons
for this advancement are better WI-FI signal
strength  and  better  signal  access  through
mobiles.

The presented work describes an active
service that supports context aware computing
by providing clients with information about
location  object  and  securing  the  object.  It
provides an indoor WI-FI positioning system
for Android smart phones. Positioning using
WI-FI signals is easy to implement and requires
lower cost than other localization systems. The
system installs Access Points dedicated for
localization at specific locations to improve

positioning  accuracy.  We  proposed  a  new
algorithm to find the location of the smart phone
and to secure smart phones. It acquires a
proper  scan  time  and  threshold  thereby
yielding a low error rate. The presented system
can be used in school, college and mall etc. to
secure the mobile device.

The existing solution for indoor localization
needs a complex hardware implementation.
In future it can be reduced by introducing the
sensing  capabilities  in  order  to  deliver
accuracy. The localization application can also
make use of hardware embedded within the
phone and can be integrated both online and
offline phases of RSS indication fingerprinting
within the same device.
