Abstract: The article develops the multi-level fusion based intelligent security system to be applied in home automation. The system
contains some detection modules, a supervised computer, an elevator and an experimental platform. The detection modules have active
detection modules and passive detection modules that are designed in our research team. The control unit of all detection modules (active
and passive) is HOLTEK microchip. Mobile robots are active detection modules, and are classiﬁed more and more teams according to
the detection functions. Each mobile robot of the team robot system transmits the real-time event signals to the supervised computer and
the other mobile robots via wireless RF interface, and moves to any ﬂoor of the experimental platform using the elevator. The passive
detection modules contain wire/wireless detection modules. If the event occurrence, the passive detection modules can decide the event
to be true or false in the level one using weighted average algorithm, and transmits the position of the event to the supervised computer
and mobile robots. Mobile robots can detect the event to be true or false using Dempster-Shafter (D-S) evidence theory, and transmits
the relation location of the event to the supervised computer, too. The supervised computer decides the event to be true according to the
feedback signals using D-S evidence theory, and controls the other mobile robots moving to the event location for double check, and
recognizes the ﬁnal decision output using D-S evidence theory in the level two. Finally, we present some experimental results using the

The supervised computer receives detection signals from
active detection modules and passive detection modules
via wireless RF interface, and uses weighted average
algorithm and D-S evidence theory to decide the event to
be true or not on multi-level detection structure. The
active detection modules include multiple team-robot

location doing double check. The detection algorithm is
D-S evidence theory. All detection modules of
the
intelligent security system have been ﬁnished, and are
arranged in the experimental platform of the intelligent
home to be shown in Figure 2. The experimental platform
has three ﬂoors. Each ﬂoor contains three rooms to be
assigned variety detection modules. Mobile robots of each

team-robot system to do double check. The security
system decides ﬁnal result of the event. The processing
schedule is level two.

We arrange an ID code in each active detection
modules and passive detection modules, and identify the
functions. The communication protocol between the
supervised computer and passive detection modules is ten
bytes to be listed in Table 1. We explain the feedback data
of the ﬁre detection modules. The protocol of the wire
module and the wireless module is the same arrangement.
There are one start byte, eight data bytes and one check
sum byte. The start byte trigs the wireless RF module to
receive the signals from the transmitter. The data bytes
contain ID code (one byte), sensor kind (one byte),
module number (1 byte), and measurement values (four
bytes). The ID code decides the transmitting direction
between of
the supervised computer and detection
modules. The sensor kind selects the attribution of carried
sensors. The communication protocol of the feedback
data from the detection modules is listed in Table 2. The
measurement values of the passive detection modules are
from byte 5 to byte 8. The supervised computer receives
the event signal from the event location, and program the
processing ﬂowchart to deal with the dangerous status.

3 Detection Module

The detection modules of intelligent home are classiﬁed
two types. One is active detection modules; the other is
passive detection modules. We explain the functions of
these detection modules as following:

3.1 Active detection modules

The main role of the active detection modules is the
mobile robot. The mobile robot has the shape of cylinder,
and its equipped with a microchip (HT46RU25) as
controller, and calculates the movement displacement

Fig. 4: The guard schedule of the mobile robot

using encoder of the DC servomotor moving on the
experimental platform. The reﬂective IR sensors of the
mobile robot detect obstacles. The mobile robot uses the
compass module to compute the orientation, and uses IR
receiver to locate the position of the elevator. The control
structure of each team-robot system uses multilevel
control structure to combine the merits of centralized
control and decentralized control. The mobile robot can
communicates with the others of the team robot system
and the supervised computer via wireless RF interface,
and knows the location of each mobile robot. The mobile
robot moves on the experimental platform, and knows the
relation distance far from the elevator according to the IR
transmitters. The IR transmitters are embedded on the
roof of the experimental platform, and guard the mobile
robot moving to the elevator to be shown in Figure 4. The
reﬂect IR sensors of the elevator is arranged on the door,
and detects the mobile robot that has been moving into
the door of the elevator.

3.2 Passive detection modules

We develop passive detection modules and appliance
control modules of the intelligent security system using
multi-models fusion architecture. The passive detection
modules contain ﬁre detection module, intruder detection
module, environment detection module, gas leakage
detection module, power detection module, and gas
detection module. The passive detection modules extend
up to 216 pieces, and are classiﬁed sensor kind and
module number to be programmed in Table 2. The
sensory kinds and detection algorithms of the passive
detection modules are listed in Table 3.

In the paper, we use wire/wireless ﬁre detection
modules to detect ﬁre source. The decision center of the
module is a HOLTEK microprocessor
to perform
computation of improved weighted average algorithm. In
general, these sensory signals are tiny voltage output. We
must process these signals to convert
to standardize
voltage output (0V ∼ +10V)by ampliﬁer circuit. The
relations of input sensory signals and output voltage
signals must be linear by tuning the processing circuits.

2 System Architecture

The system architecture of intelligent home is shown in
Figure 1. The system contains passive detection modules,
active detection modules and some system supervised
devices [5]. The passive detection modules contain
wire/wireless detection modules. The wire based
detection modules communicate with the supervised
computer via wire RS485 interface. The wireless based
detection modules communicate with the supervised
computer and mobile robots via wireless RF interface.
The supervised computer receives detection signals from
active detection modules and passive detection modules
via wireless RF interface, and uses weighted average
algorithm and D-S evidence theory to decide the event to
be true or not on multi-level detection structure. The
active detection modules include multiple team-robot
systems. Mobile robots of each team-robot system carry
the same sensor
the dangerous event of
intelligent home. Multiple team-robot systems use variety
sensors to detect variety events. The other mobile robots
of the team-robot system receive the event signals from
the supervised computer or the same function based
passive detection modules, and moves to the event
location doing double check. The detection algorithm is
D-S evidence theory. All detection modules of
the
intelligent security system have been ﬁnished, and are
arranged in the experimental platform of the intelligent
home to be shown in Figure 2. The experimental platform
has three ﬂoors. Each ﬂoor contains three rooms to be
assigned variety detection modules. Mobile robots of each
team-robot system move on any ﬂoor of the experimental
platform to detect event using the elevator. The elevator
uses many IR transmitters to guard the mobile robots
moving into the elevator, and communicates with mobile
robots via wireless RF interface.

The detection processing of the security system is
classiﬁed two levels to be shown in Figure 3. We use
passive detection modules and mobile robots around the

the event signals to the supervised
computer via wire RS485 interface or wireless RF
interface. We call the processing schedule to be level one.
Then the supervised computer has

system decides ﬁnal result of the event. The processing
schedule is level two.

We arrange an ID code in each active detection
modules and passive detection modules, and identify the
functions. The communication protocol between the
supervised computer and passive detection modules is ten
bytes to be listed in Table 1. We explain the feedback data
of the ﬁre detection modules. The protocol of the wire
module and the wireless module is the same arrangement.
There are one start byte, eight data bytes and one check
sum byte. The start byte trigs the wireless RF module to
receive the signals from the transmitter. The data bytes
contain ID code (one byte), sensor kind (one byte),
module number (1 byte), and measurement values (four
bytes). The ID code decides the transmitting direction
between of
the supervised computer and detection
modules. The sensor kind selects the attribution of carried
sensors. The communication protocol of the feedback
data from the detection modules is listed in Table 2. The
measurement values of the passive detection modules are
from byte 5 to byte 8. The supervised computer receives
the event signal from the event location, and program the
processing ﬂowchart to deal with the dangerous status.

3 Detection Module

The detection modules of intelligent home are classiﬁed
two types. One is active detection modules; the other is
passive detection modules. We explain the functions of
these detection modules as following:

3.1 Active detection modules

The main role of the active detection modules is the
mobile robot. The mobile robot has the shape of cylinder,
and its equipped with a microchip (HT46RU25) as
controller, and calculates the movement displacement

using encoder of the DC servomotor moving on the
experimental platform. The reﬂective IR sensors of the
mobile robot detect obstacles. The mobile robot uses the
compass module to compute the orientation, and uses IR
receiver to locate the position of the elevator. The control
structure of each team-robot system uses multilevel
control structure to combine the merits of centralized
control and decentralized control. The mobile robot can
communicates with the others of the team robot system
and the supervised computer via wireless RF interface,
and knows the location of each mobile robot. The mobile
robot moves on the experimental platform, and knows the
relation distance far from the elevator according to the IR
transmitters. The IR transmitters are embedded on the
roof of the experimental platform, and guard the mobile
robot moving to the elevator to be shown in Figure 4. The
reﬂect IR sensors of the elevator is arranged on the door,
and detects the mobile robot that has been moving into
the door of the elevator.

3.2 Passive detection modules

We develop passive detection modules and appliance
control modules of the intelligent security system using
multi-models fusion architecture. The passive detection
modules contain ﬁre detection module, intruder detection
module, environment detection module, gas leakage
detection module, power detection module, and gas
detection module. The passive detection modules extend
up to 216 pieces, and are classiﬁed sensor kind and
module number to be programmed in Table 2. The
sensory kinds and detection algorithms of the passive
detection modules are listed in Table 3.

In the paper, we use wire/wireless ﬁre detection
modules to detect ﬁre source. The decision center of the
module is a HOLTEK microprocessor
to perform
computation of improved weighted average algorithm. In
general, these sensory signals are tiny voltage output. We
must process these signals to convert
to standardize
voltage output (0V ∼ +10V)by ampliﬁer circuit. The
relations of input sensory signals and output voltage
signals must be linear by tuning the processing circuits.

5 Experimental Results

In the intelligent security system, we use wire ﬁre
detection module and wireless ﬁre detection module and
the ﬁre based team-robot system to detect the ﬁre source
on the experimental platform. We use one lighter to
provide ﬁre source on the wire and wireless ﬁre detection
modules, and test the function of the modules to be right
respectively. The detection modules can transmit
the
detection signals to the supervised computer via wire
RS485 and wireless RF interface. The label of the ﬁre
detection modules displays green on the user interface to
be shown in Figure 6(a). We provide the ﬁre source to the
two ﬁre detection modules to test cooperation working.
The supervised computer can decides the event to be true
using weighted average algorithm in the level one. The
experimental result is shown in the bottom of Figure 6
(b).

Then the mobile robots of the ﬁre based team-robot
system with ﬂame sensor moves to the event location.
The mobile robot 1 detects the ﬁre event (candle), and
transmits the event signal to the supervised computer to
be shown in Figure 7 (a). The mobile robot 2 moves to the
event location, and transmits the detection signal to the
supervised computer,
too. The supervised computer
receives the event signal to calculate the belief value
using D-S evidence theory. The belief value (0.7278) is
not over the threshold value (0.800) to be shown in Figure
7 (b). The detection processing is level one, too. Users
can set the threshold value on the user interface of the
supervised computer before the test.

The mobile robot 3 of the ﬁre based team-robot
system detects the ﬁre source on the platform, too. The
supervised computer uses D-S evidence theory to
calculate belief value is 0.9617 to be bigger than the
threshold. The label of the detection event is red to be
shown in Figure 7(c). We set the probability values to be
the same for each ﬂame sensor of the mobile robots.
Finally we make a decision to be true for the ﬁre event in
the level one.

The supervised computer controls the other mobile
robot of the ﬁre based team-robot system moving to the
ﬁre location for double check in the level two. Now the

ﬁre event is at the second ﬂoor. The mobile robot is at the
ﬁrst ﬂoor. The mobile robot receives the signals of the IR
transmitters moving closed to the elevator at the ﬁrst
ﬂoor, and communicates with the elevator via wireless RF
interface. The mobile robot orders command to open the
door of the elevator, and moves into the elevator. The
elevator carries the mobile robot going up to the second
ﬂoor, and opens the door. The mobile robot leaves the
elevator moving to the ﬁre location to be shown in Figure
8.

In the level two, the supervised computer has received
the signals from the passive ﬁre detection modules to be
shown in Figure 9(a). We use red label to present the

mobile robot. The mobile robot has the shape of cylinder,
and its equipped with a microchip (HT46RU25) as
controller, and calculates the movement displacement

experimental platform. The reﬂective IR sensors of the
mobile robot detect obstacles. The mobile robot uses the
compass module to compute the orientation, and uses IR
receiver to locate the position of the elevator. The control
structure of each team-robot system uses multilevel
control structure to combine the merits of centralized
control and decentralized control. The mobile robot can
communicates with the others of the team robot system
and the supervised computer via wireless RF interface,
and knows the location of each mobile robot. The mobile
robot moves on the experimental platform, and knows the
relation distance far from the elevator according to the IR
transmitters. The IR transmitters are embedded on the
roof of the experimental platform, and guard the mobile
robot moving to the elevator to be shown in Figure 4. The
reﬂect IR sensors of the elevator is arranged on the door,
and detects the mobile robot that has been moving into
the door of the elevator.

3.2 Passive detection modules

We develop passive detection modules and appliance
control modules of the intelligent security system using
multi-models fusion architecture. The passive detection
modules contain ﬁre detection module, intruder detection
module, environment detection module, gas leakage
detection module, power detection module, and gas
detection module. The passive detection modules extend
up to 216 pieces, and are classiﬁed sensor kind and
module number to be programmed in Table 2. The
sensory kinds and detection algorithms of the passive
detection modules are listed in Table 3.

In the paper, we use wire/wireless ﬁre detection
modules to detect ﬁre source. The decision center of the
module is a HOLTEK microprocessor
to perform
computation of improved weighted average algorithm. In
general, these sensory signals are tiny voltage output. We
must process these signals to convert
to standardize
voltage output (0V ∼ +10V)by ampliﬁer circuit. The
relations of input sensory signals and output voltage
signals must be linear by tuning the processing circuits.

5 Experimental Results

In the intelligent security system, we use wire ﬁre
detection module and wireless ﬁre detection module and
the ﬁre based team-robot system to detect the ﬁre source
on the experimental platform. We use one lighter to
provide ﬁre source on the wire and wireless ﬁre detection
modules, and test the function of the modules to be right
respectively. The detection modules can transmit
the
detection signals to the supervised computer via wire
RS485 and wireless RF interface. The label of the ﬁre
detection modules displays green on the user interface to
be shown in Figure 6(a). We provide the ﬁre source to the
two ﬁre detection modules to test cooperation working.
The supervised computer can decides the event to be true
using weighted average algorithm in the level one. The
experimental result is shown in the bottom of Figure 6
(b).

Then the mobile robots of the ﬁre based team-robot
system with ﬂame sensor moves to the event location.
The mobile robot 1 detects the ﬁre event (candle), and
transmits the event signal to the supervised computer to
be shown in Figure 7 (a). The mobile robot 2 moves to the
event location, and transmits the detection signal to the
supervised computer,
too. The supervised computer
receives the event signal to calculate the belief value
using D-S evidence theory. The belief value (0.7278) is
not over the threshold value (0.800) to be shown in Figure
7 (b). The detection processing is level one, too. Users
can set the threshold value on the user interface of the
supervised computer before the test.

The mobile robot 3 of the ﬁre based team-robot
system detects the ﬁre source on the platform, too. The
supervised computer uses D-S evidence theory to
calculate belief value is 0.9617 to be bigger than the
threshold. The label of the detection event is red to be
shown in Figure 7(c). We set the probability values to be
the same for each ﬂame sensor of the mobile robots.
Finally we make a decision to be true for the ﬁre event in
the level one.

The supervised computer controls the other mobile
robot of the ﬁre based team-robot system moving to the
ﬁre location for double check in the level two. Now the

Abstract: The article develops the multi-level fusion based intelligent security system to be applied in home automation. The system
contains some detection modules, a supervised computer, an elevator and an experimental platform. The detection modules have active
detection modules and passive detection modules that are designed in our research team. The control unit of all detection modules (active
and passive) is HOLTEK microchip. Mobile robots are active detection modules, and are classiﬁed more and more teams according to
the detection functions. Each mobile robot of the team robot system transmits the real-time event signals to the supervised computer and
the other mobile robots via wireless RF interface, and moves to any ﬂoor of the experimental platform using the elevator. The passive
detection modules contain wire/wireless detection modules. If the event occurrence, the passive detection modules can decide the event
to be true or false in the level one using weighted average algorithm, and transmits the position of the event to the supervised computer
and mobile robots. Mobile robots can detect the event to be true or false using Dempster-Shafter (D-S) evidence theory, and transmits
the relation location of the event to the supervised computer, too. The supervised computer decides the event to be true according to the
feedback signals using D-S evidence theory, and controls the other mobile robots moving to the event location for double check, and
recognizes the ﬁnal decision output using D-S evidence theory in the level two. Finally, we present some experimental results using the
active and passive detection modules to detect the ﬁre source on the experimental platform

In the past literatures, many experts research in the
security system. Azegami and Fujiyoshi [1] described a
systematic approach to intelligent building design. Kujuro
and Yasuda [2] discussed the systems evolution in
intelligent building. Chung and Fu expected to set up the
standard of appliances and communication protocols, and
proposed a complete system architecture with integrate
control kernel to construct an intelligent building [3].

Mobile robots are main roles of the active detection
modules in the security system. Recently more and more
researchers take interest in the ﬁeld especially intelligent
service robot. Yoichi Shimosasa et
al. developed
autonomous guard robot [4] which integrated the security
and service system. There are more merits in the mobile
robots to use team robot cooperation capabilities to such a

2 System Architecture

The system architecture of intelligent home is shown in
Figure 1. The system contains passive detection modules,
active detection modules and some system supervised
devices [5]. The passive detection modules contain
wire/wireless detection modules. The wire based
detection modules communicate with the supervised
computer via wire RS485 interface. The wireless based
detection modules communicate with the supervised
computer and mobile robots via wireless RF interface.
The supervised computer receives detection signals from
active detection modules and passive detection modules
via wireless RF interface, and uses weighted average
algorithm and D-S evidence theory to decide the event to
be true or not on multi-level detection structure. The
active detection modules include multiple team-robot
systems. Mobile robots of each team-robot system carry
the same sensor
the dangerous event of
intelligent home. Multiple team-robot systems use variety
sensors to detect variety events. The other mobile robots
of the team-robot system receive the event signals from
the supervised computer or the same function based
passive detection modules, and moves to the event
location doing double check. The detection algorithm is
D-S evidence theory. All detection modules of
the
intelligent security system have been ﬁnished, and are
arranged in the experimental platform of the intelligent
home to be shown in Figure 2. The experimental platform
has three ﬂoors. Each ﬂoor contains three rooms to be
assigned variety detection modules. Mobile robots of each
team-robot system move on any ﬂoor of the experimental
platform to detect event using the elevator. The elevator
uses many IR transmitters to guard the mobile robots
moving into the elevator, and communicates with mobile
robots via wireless RF interface.

The detection processing of the security system is
classiﬁed two levels to be shown in Figure 3. We use
passive detection modules and mobile robots around the
event location to make a decision using weighted average
algorithm and D-S evidence theory. These detection
modules transmit
the event signals to the supervised
computer via wire RS485 interface or wireless RF
interface. We call the processing schedule to be level one.
Then the supervised computer has
received these
detection signals to make a decision using D-S evidence
theory, and controls the other mobile robots of the same

team-robot system to do double check. The security
system decides ﬁnal result of the event. The processing
schedule is level two.

We arrange an ID code in each active detection
modules and passive detection modules, and identify the
functions. The communication protocol between the
supervised computer and passive detection modules is ten
bytes to be listed in Table 1. We explain the feedback data
of the ﬁre detection modules. The protocol of the wire
module and the wireless module is the same arrangement.
There are one start byte, eight data bytes and one check
sum byte. The start byte trigs the wireless RF module to
receive the signals from the transmitter. The data bytes
contain ID code (one byte), sensor kind (one byte),
module number (1 byte), and measurement values (four
bytes). The ID code decides the transmitting direction
between of
the supervised computer and detection
modules. The sensor kind selects the attribution of carried
sensors. The communication protocol of the feedback
data from the detection modules is listed in Table 2. The
measurement values of the passive detection modules are
from byte 5 to byte 8. The supervised computer receives
the event signal from the event location, and program the
processing ﬂowchart to deal with the dangerous status.

3 Detection Module

The detection modules of intelligent home are classiﬁed
two types. One is active detection modules; the other is
passive detection modules. We explain the functions of
these detection modules as following:

3.1 Active detection modules

The main role of the active detection modules is the
mobile robot. The mobile robot has the shape of cylinder,
and its equipped with a microchip (HT46RU25) as
controller, and calculates the movement displacement

experimental platform. The reﬂective IR sensors of the
mobile robot detect obstacles. The mobile robot uses the
compass module to compute the orientation, and uses IR
receiver to locate the position of the elevator. The control
structure of each team-robot system uses multilevel
control structure to combine the merits of centralized
control and decentralized control. The mobile robot can
communicates with the others of the team robot system
and the supervised computer via wireless RF interface,
and knows the location of each mobile robot. The mobile
robot moves on the experimental platform, and knows the
relation distance far from the elevator according to the IR
transmitters. The IR transmitters are embedded on the
roof of the experimental platform, and guard the mobile
robot moving to the elevator to be shown in Figure 4. The
reﬂect IR sensors of the elevator is arranged on the door,
and detects the mobile robot that has been moving into
the door of the elevator.

3.2 Passive detection modules

We develop passive detection modules and appliance
control modules of the intelligent security system using
multi-models fusion architecture. The passive detection
modules contain ﬁre detection module, intruder detection
module, environment detection module, gas leakage
detection module, power detection module, and gas
detection module. The passive detection modules extend
up to 216 pieces, and are classiﬁed sensor kind and
module number to be programmed in Table 2. The
sensory kinds and detection algorithms of the passive
detection modules are listed in Table 3.

In the paper, we use wire/wireless ﬁre detection
modules to detect ﬁre source. The decision center of the
module is a HOLTEK microprocessor
to perform
computation of improved weighted average algorithm. In
general, these sensory signals are tiny voltage output. We
must process these signals to convert
to standardize
voltage output (0V ∼ +10V)by ampliﬁer circuit. The
relations of input sensory signals and output voltage
signals must be linear by tuning the processing circuits.

two ﬁre detection modules to test cooperation working.
The supervised computer can decides the event to be true
using weighted average algorithm in the level one. The
experimental result is shown in the bottom of Figure 6

Then the mobile robots of the ﬁre based team-robot

The mobile robot 1 detects the ﬁre event (candle), and
transmits the event signal to the supervised computer to

event location, and transmits the detection signal to the
supervised computer,
too. The supervised computer
receives the event signal to calculate the belief value
using D-S evidence theory. The belief value (0.7278) is
not over the threshold value (0.800) to be shown in Figure
7 (b). The detection processing is level one, too. Users
can set the threshold value on the user interface of the
supervised computer before the test.

The mobile robot 3 of the ﬁre based team-robot
system detects the ﬁre source on the platform, too. The
supervised computer uses D-S evidence theory to
calculate belief value is 0.9617 to be bigger than the
threshold. The label of the detection event is red to be
shown in Figure 7(c). We set the probability values to be
the same for each ﬂame sensor of the mobile robots.
Finally we make a decision to be true for the ﬁre event in
the level one.

The supervised computer controls the other mobile
robot of the ﬁre based team-robot system moving to the
ﬁre location for double check in the level two. Now the

event to be true. Then the mobile robot of the ﬁre based
team-robot system moves to the ﬁre location, and detects
the ﬁre event on the experimental platform, and transmits
the event signal to the supervised computer, too. The
experiment scenario is shown in Figure 9(b). Finally the
supervised computer calculates the ﬁnal decision using
D-S evidence theory. The belief value is 0.9709 over the
threshold value to be shown in Figure 9(c), and is bigger
than the previous belief value (0.9617). We have more
conﬁdence to decide the ﬁre event to be true.

6 Conclusion

enhance

accuracy,

We have presented a multi-level based security system to
be applied in intelligent home. The controller of the active
and passive detection modules is HOLTEK microchip.
We use weighted average algorithm and D-S evidence
theory
and
implemented the proposed algorithms in the supervised
computer. We use ﬁre event to implement the function of
the multi-level based security system, and present
experimental scenario on the experimental platform. The
supervised computer makes double check the event
occurrence. In the future, we want to integrate more and
more passive detection modules, and cooperate with the
multiple team-robot systems, and develop new user
interface and remote supervised system to connect with
the security system via Internet.
