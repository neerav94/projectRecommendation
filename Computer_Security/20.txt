utilized  a  pressure  sensor  with  IR  sensors  for  the 
detection of vehicles and the locomotive respectively 
[7]. However in this system the reliability of pressure 
based  sensing  approach  is  less  since  the  pressure 
sensor  cannot  distinguish  between  vehicles  on  and 
around the railway crossing also it cannot function in 
a  potential  collision  wherein  both  the  vehicle  and 
locomotive  are  approaching,  the  determination  of 
presence  of  a  vehicle  will  be  an  issue  due  to  the 
weight of the track also the life of the sensor will not 
be  much  due  to  the  movement  of  heavy  locomotives 
over it. Another model was discussed by Cai Guoqiang 
et.al  on  Rail  Safety  Security  System  which  involved 
integrating  several  existing  railway  safety  and 
security systems on a whole involving monitoring and 
early warning, risk assessment, predictive control and 
emergency rescue system [8]. Since the integration of

model  of  Wireless  Sensor  Network  Based  Model  for 
Secure  Railway  Operations  involving  the  use  of 
accelerometers  and  ultrasonic  sensors  capable 
enough  to  detect  wear  on  the  rail  and  breakages  in 
them  however  the  accumulation  and  detection  of 
WSN  requires  large  amount  of  time  and  complex 
technicalities. In a condition where real time decision

train.  The  signal  about  the  departure  is  sent  to  the 
microcontroller,  which  in  turn  operates  the  motor 
and opens the gate. Thus, the time for which the gate 
is  closed  is  less  compared  to  the  manually  operated 
gates  since  the  gate  is  closed  depending  upon  the 
telephone  call 
from  the  previous  station.  Also 
reliability  is  high,  as  it  is  not  subjected  to  manual 
errors. The peoples of present age are using the fossil 
fuels  very  rapidly  for  electricity  generation  and  for 
domestic purpose. If with the same rate the fossil fuel 
is in use then in next 35 to 40 years they are going to 
be extinct and we are in a deep trouble. The rationale 
behind  this  concept  is  to  produce  the  electrical 
potential  with  help  of  mechanical  work.  At  present, 
lights  of  railway  tunnels  are  glowing  permanently 
which is not necessary but by this concept, lights are 
allowed to glow at the time when it is required. Since 
there  are  a  large  number  of  railway  tunnels  in  India 
so by applying this concept large amount of electrical 
energy  can  be  saved  which  is  generated  by  non-
renewable sources energy like coal. 
2.  RESEARCH FOUNDATION 
ITS  (Intelligent  Traffic  System)  is  a  topic  of  huge 
concern  to  our  developing  world  and  a  lot  of  prior 
research  has  been  done  but  due  to  diversities  of 
technologies  and  fields.  The  absence  of  a  unified 
system  exists.  Acy  M.  Kottalil  et.al  proposed  a  model 
of  Automatic  Railway  Gate  Control  System  using  IR 
sensors  for  detection  of  trains  at  railway  crossings 
and  controlling  level  crossing  gates  accordingly  [3]. 
But  the  system  is  considered  to  be  very  less  reliable 
due  to  the  presence  of  very  highly  sensitive  IR 
sensors which is  considered to compromise with the 
sensing  in  the  presence  of  sunlight.  Anjali  Jain  et.al 
came  up  with  a  Collision  Detection  and  Avoidance 
System 
in  Railways  Using  WiMAX  the  system 
incorporated  4G  WiMAX  with  GPS  for  calculation 
location of equipped locomotives the system is able to 
clarify  the  fact  that  one  to  one  collisions  can  be 
avoided  by  using  it  however  a  decrement  in  one  to 
one  collisions  is  observed  with  the  use  of  advanced 
automatic signaling in railways [4]. Since this system 
might not be able to report collisions at level crossing 
considering  accidents  at 
crossings  are 
considerably  trending  the  capital  invested  in  the 
system  will  not  be  efficient  enough.  Another 
microcontroller  based  approach  was  discussed  by 
Krishna et.al using 8952 microcontroller and sensors 
to  sense  the  location  of  train  and  act  accordingly  to 
control  the  movement  of  level  crossing  [6].  But  the 
use  of  a  small  scale  approach  for  a  really  complex 
network  will  not  be  sufficient  enough  to  uphold  the 
requirements  of  railways  also  the  reliability  of  the 
system  will  not  be  good  enough.  A  PLC  based 
approach  was  followed  by  Mahesh  Nandaniya  et.al 
with real time monitoring using SCADA the approach 
is  reliable  but  the  capital  investment  in  every  level 
crossing by single PLC will result inefficient in a way 
since there is a very  large quantity  of level crossings 
and controlling every level crossing with a PLC of its 
own  will  increase  the  capital  cost  by  many  folds  [6].

3.3  Railway Crossings 
Elimination  of  Level  Crossings  is  a  gigantic  task  and 
involves  lot  of  manpower,  resources  and  budgetary 
support. It is a continuous process and is done as per 
need,  inter-se  priority  of  works,  availability  of  funds 
and co-operation of State Government, particularly, in 
getting  consent  of  closure  of  level  crossing  and 
undertaking  to  maintain  road and drainage in  future 
for  subways.  The  details  of  railway  accidents 
occurred  at  Level  Crossings  from  the  year  2002-03 
and onwards are given below [11].

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Indian  Railways  is  the  lifeline  of  India.  To  make  it  a 
safe and reliable is a challenge. The Railways has the 
most 
inter-dependent  attributes.  Safety  on  the 
Railways is the end product of the cohesive fusion of 
its myriad parts. A single flaw in the 64,600 route kms 
of  track  that  criss-cross  the  country,  a  defect  in over 
9,500  locos,  55,000  coaches  and  2.39  lakh  wagons 
that haul about 23 million passengers and nearly 2.7 

million  tons  of  freight  every  day  [1],  an  incorrect 
indication on one of the thousands of signals that dot 
the  rail  landscape,  a  mistake  or  an  act  of  negligence 
by  one  of  its  staff  directly  associated  with  train 
running, even a rash act by one of the millions of road 
users  who  daily  negotiate  around  odd  level  crossing 
gates  spread  across  the  system,  an  irresponsible  act 
of  carrying  inflammable  goods  –  any  one  of  these 
multiple  possibilities  has  the  potential  to  cause  a 
major tragedy. Added to these are the acts of sabotage 
by  misguided  elements  spanning  the  whole  country. 
Thus  utmost  vigil  is  safety  in  operations  and  also 
security  of  the  traveling  public  is  accorded  by  the 
Railways.  Railway  safety  is  a  crucial  aspect  of  rail 
operation over the world. The chart below shows the 
relationship  of  movement  of  traffic  to  that  of  the 
occurrence of accidents from 1960 to 2010 [2].

in  manual  operations  or 

Accidents  at  railway  crossings  are  mainly  due  to  the 
carelessness 
lack  of 
personals.  This  model  deals  with  two  prospects. 
Firstly,  it  deals  with  the  reduction  of  time  for  which 
the gate is being kept shut. And secondly, to  provide 
safety to the road users by reducing the accidents that 
usually occur due to carelessness of road users and at 
times  errors  made  by  the  gatekeepers.  In  order  to 
achieve  the  desired  goal,  sensors  are  placed  at  some 
distance  from  the  gate  detects  the  departure  of  the

utilized  a  pressure  sensor  with  IR  sensors  for  the 
detection of vehicles and the locomotive respectively 
[7]. However in this system the reliability of pressure 
based  sensing  approach  is  less  since  the  pressure 
sensor  cannot  distinguish  between  vehicles  on  and 
around the railway crossing also it cannot function in 
a  potential  collision  wherein  both  the  vehicle  and 
locomotive  are  approaching,  the  determination  of 
presence  of  a  vehicle  will  be  an  issue  due  to  the 
weight of the track also the life of the sensor will not 
be  much  due  to  the  movement  of  heavy  locomotives 
over it. Another model was discussed by Cai Guoqiang 
et.al  on  Rail  Safety  Security  System  which  involved 
integrating  several  existing  railway  safety  and 
security systems on a whole involving monitoring and 
early warning, risk assessment, predictive control and 
emergency rescue system [8]. Since the integration of 
the  existing  system  will  be  cumbersome  task  it  will

to  work 
incorporating themselves with  each other which will 
include  huge  capital  investment  and  the  resultant 
system will be very complex in nature turning out to 
be very less reliable. Emad Aboelela et.al proposed a 
model  of  Wireless  Sensor  Network  Based  Model  for 
Secure  Railway  Operations  involving  the  use  of 
accelerometers  and  ultrasonic  sensors  capable 
enough  to  detect  wear  on  the  rail  and  breakages  in 
them  however  the  accumulation  and  detection  of 
WSN  requires  large  amount  of  time  and  complex 
technicalities. In a condition where real time decision 
making  is  required  the  current  system  will  fail  to 
provide solution due to the processing incapability of 
data from WSN [9].

3.  QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS 
The 
“accident‟  covers  a  wide  area  of 
occurrences with or without significant impact on the 
system,  Consecutive  train  accidents  include  mishaps 
with serious outcomes in  terms of loss of human  life 
and 
railway  property  or 
interruption  in  rail  traffic.  These  consequential  train 
accidents

trains,  road  vehicles  colliding  with  trains  at  level 
crossings,

types 

3.1  Collisions and Derailments

the  collisions  and 
derailments  in  Indian  railways  due  to  the  failure  of 
the staffs from 1965 to 2010 [11]. 

train.  The  signal  about  the  departure  is  sent  to  the 
microcontroller,  which  in  turn  operates  the  motor 
and opens the gate. Thus, the time for which the gate 
is  closed  is  less  compared  to  the  manually  operated 
gates  since  the  gate  is  closed  depending  upon  the 
telephone  call 
from  the  previous  station.  Also 
reliability  is  high,  as  it  is  not  subjected  to  manual 
errors. The peoples of present age are using the fossil 
fuels  very  rapidly  for  electricity  generation  and  for 
domestic purpose. If with the same rate the fossil fuel 
is in use then in next 35 to 40 years they are going to 
be extinct and we are in a deep trouble. The rationale 
behind  this  concept  is  to  produce  the  electrical 
potential  with  help  of  mechanical  work.  At  present, 
lights  of  railway  tunnels  are  glowing  permanently 
which is not necessary but by this concept, lights are 
allowed to glow at the time when it is required. Since 
there  are  a  large  number  of  railway  tunnels  in  India 
so by applying this concept large amount of electrical 
energy  can  be  saved  which  is  generated  by  non-
renewable sources energy like coal. 
2.  RESEARCH FOUNDATION 
ITS  (Intelligent  Traffic  System)  is  a  topic  of  huge 
concern  to  our  developing  world  and  a  lot  of  prior 
research  has  been  done  but  due  to  diversities  of 
technologies  and  fields.  The  absence  of  a  unified 
system  exists.  Acy  M.  Kottalil  et.al  proposed  a  model 
of  Automatic  Railway  Gate  Control  System  using  IR 
sensors  for  detection  of  trains  at  railway  crossings 
and  controlling  level  crossing  gates  accordingly  [3]. 
But  the  system  is  considered  to  be  very  less  reliable 
due  to  the  presence  of  very  highly  sensitive  IR 
sensors which is  considered to compromise with the 
sensing  in  the  presence  of  sunlight.  Anjali  Jain  et.al 
came  up  with  a  Collision  Detection  and  Avoidance 
System 
in  Railways  Using  WiMAX  the  system 
incorporated  4G  WiMAX  with  GPS  for  calculation 
location of equipped locomotives the system is able to 
clarify  the  fact  that  one  to  one  collisions  can  be 
avoided  by  using  it  however  a  decrement  in  one  to 
one  collisions  is  observed  with  the  use  of  advanced 
automatic signaling in railways [4]. Since this system 
might not be able to report collisions at level crossing 
considering  accidents  at 
crossings  are 
considerably  trending  the  capital  invested  in  the 
system  will  not  be  efficient  enough.  Another 
microcontroller  based  approach  was  discussed  by 
Krishna et.al using 8952 microcontroller and sensors 
to  sense  the  location  of  train  and  act  accordingly  to 
control  the  movement  of  level  crossing  [6].  But  the 
use  of  a  small  scale  approach  for  a  really  complex 
network  will  not  be  sufficient  enough  to  uphold  the 
requirements  of  railways  also  the  reliability  of  the 
system  will  not  be  good  enough.  A  PLC  based 
approach  was  followed  by  Mahesh  Nandaniya  et.al 
with real time monitoring using SCADA the approach 
is  reliable  but  the  capital  investment  in  every  level 
crossing by single PLC will result inefficient in a way 
since there is a very  large quantity  of level crossings 
and controlling every level crossing with a PLC of its 
own  will  increase  the  capital  cost  by  many  folds  [6].

major tragedy. Added to these are the acts of sabotage 
by  misguided  elements  spanning  the  whole  country. 
Thus  utmost  vigil  is  safety  in  operations  and  also 
security  of  the  traveling  public  is  accorded  by  the 
Railways.  Railway  safety  is  a  crucial  aspect  of  rail 
operation over the world. The chart below shows the 
relationship  of  movement  of  traffic  to  that  of  the 
occurrence of accidents from 1960 to 2010 [2].

Accidents  at  railway  crossings  are  mainly  due  to  the

personals.  This  model  deals  with  two  prospects. 
Firstly,  it  deals  with  the  reduction  of  time  for  which 
the gate is being kept shut. And secondly, to  provide 
safety to the road users by reducing the accidents that 
usually occur due to carelessness of road users and at 
times  errors  made  by  the  gatekeepers.  In  order  to 
achieve  the  desired  goal,  sensors  are  placed  at  some 
distance  from  the  gate  detects  the  departure  of  the

utilized  a  pressure  sensor  with  IR  sensors  for  the 
detection of vehicles and the locomotive respectively 
[7]. However in this system the reliability of pressure 
based  sensing  approach  is  less  since  the  pressure 
sensor  cannot  distinguish  between  vehicles  on  and 
around the railway crossing also it cannot function in 
a  potential  collision  wherein  both  the  vehicle  and 
locomotive  are  approaching,  the  determination  of 
presence  of  a  vehicle  will  be  an  issue  due  to  the 
weight of the track also the life of the sensor will not 
be  much  due  to  the  movement  of  heavy  locomotives 
over it. Another model was discussed by Cai Guoqiang 
et.al  on  Rail  Safety  Security  System  which  involved 
integrating  several  existing  railway  safety  and 
security systems on a whole involving monitoring and 
early warning, risk assessment, predictive control and 
emergency rescue system [8]. Since the integration of 
the  existing  system  will  be  cumbersome  task  it  will

model  of  Wireless  Sensor  Network  Based  Model  for 
Secure  Railway  Operations  involving  the  use  of 
accelerometers  and  ultrasonic  sensors  capable 
enough  to  detect  wear  on  the  rail  and  breakages  in

WSN  requires  large  amount  of  time  and  complex

3.  QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS 
The 
“accident‟  covers  a  wide  area  of 
occurrences with or without significant impact on the 
system,  Consecutive  train  accidents  include  mishaps 
with serious outcomes in  terms of loss of human  life 
and 
railway  property  or 
interruption  in  rail  traffic.  These  consequential  train

3.1  Collisions and Derailments

the  collisions  and 
derailments  in  Indian  railways  due  to  the  failure  of 
the staffs from 1965 to 2010 [11]. 

train.  The  signal  about  the  departure  is  sent  to  the 
microcontroller,  which  in  turn  operates  the  motor 
and opens the gate. Thus, the time for which the gate 
is  closed  is  less  compared  to  the  manually  operated 
gates  since  the  gate  is  closed  depending  upon  the 
telephone  call 
from  the  previous  station.  Also 
reliability  is  high,  as  it  is  not  subjected  to  manual 
errors. The peoples of present age are using the fossil 
fuels  very  rapidly  for  electricity  generation  and  for 
domestic purpose. If with the same rate the fossil fuel 
is in use then in next 35 to 40 years they are going to 
be extinct and we are in a deep trouble. The rationale 
behind  this  concept  is  to  produce  the  electrical 
potential  with  help  of  mechanical  work.  At  present, 
lights  of  railway  tunnels  are  glowing  permanently 
which is not necessary but by this concept, lights are 
allowed to glow at the time when it is required. Since 
there  are  a  large  number  of  railway  tunnels  in  India 
so by applying this concept large amount of electrical 
energy  can  be  saved  which  is  generated  by  non-
renewable sources energy like coal. 
2.  RESEARCH FOUNDATION 
ITS  (Intelligent  Traffic  System)  is  a  topic  of  huge 
concern  to  our  developing  world  and  a  lot  of  prior 
research  has  been  done  but  due  to  diversities  of 
technologies  and  fields.  The  absence  of  a  unified 
system  exists.  Acy  M.  Kottalil  et.al  proposed  a  model 
of  Automatic  Railway  Gate  Control  System  using  IR 
sensors  for  detection  of  trains  at  railway  crossings 
and  controlling  level  crossing  gates  accordingly  [3]. 
But  the  system  is  considered  to  be  very  less  reliable 
due  to  the  presence  of  very  highly  sensitive  IR 
sensors which is  considered to compromise with the 
sensing  in  the  presence  of  sunlight.  Anjali  Jain  et.al 
came  up  with  a  Collision  Detection  and  Avoidance 
System 
in  Railways  Using  WiMAX  the  system 
incorporated  4G  WiMAX  with  GPS  for  calculation 
location of equipped locomotives the system is able to 
clarify  the  fact  that  one  to  one  collisions  can  be 
avoided  by  using  it  however  a  decrement  in  one  to 
one  collisions  is  observed  with  the  use  of  advanced 
automatic signaling in railways [4]. Since this system 
might not be able to report collisions at level crossing 
considering  accidents  at 
crossings  are 
considerably  trending  the  capital  invested  in  the 
system  will  not  be  efficient  enough.  Another 
microcontroller  based  approach  was  discussed  by 
Krishna et.al using 8952 microcontroller and sensors 
to  sense  the  location  of  train  and  act  accordingly  to 
control  the  movement  of  level  crossing  [6].  But  the 
use  of  a  small  scale  approach  for  a  really  complex 
network  will  not  be  sufficient  enough  to  uphold  the 
requirements  of  railways  also  the  reliability  of  the 
system  will  not  be  good  enough.  A  PLC  based 
approach  was  followed  by  Mahesh  Nandaniya  et.al 
with real time monitoring using SCADA the approach 
is  reliable  but  the  capital  investment  in  every  level 
crossing by single PLC will result inefficient in a way 
since there is a very  large quantity  of level crossings 
and controlling every level crossing with a PLC of its 
own  will  increase  the  capital  cost  by  many  folds  [6].

3.3  Railway Crossings 
Elimination  of  Level  Crossings  is  a  gigantic  task  and 
involves  lot  of  manpower,  resources  and  budgetary 
support. It is a continuous process and is done as per 
need,  inter-se  priority  of  works,  availability  of  funds 
and co-operation of State Government, particularly, in 
getting  consent  of  closure  of  level  crossing  and 
undertaking  to  maintain  road and drainage in  future 
for  subways.  The  details  of  railway  accidents 
occurred  at  Level  Crossings  from  the  year  2002-03 
and onwards are given below [11].

4.1  IR Sensors 
The  IR  Sensor-Single  is  a  general  purpose  proximity 
sensor.  Here  we  use  it  for  collision  detection.  The 
module consists of an IR emitter and IR receiver pair. 
The  high  precision  IR  receiver  always  detects  an  IR 

Fig 5: Reed Switch 

 

4.3  MOC 3021 
The  MOC30XX  family  of  non-zero  crossing  triac 
drivers  consist  of  an  aluminum  gallium  arsenide 
infrared  LED,  optically  coupled  to  a  silicon  detector 
chip.  These  two  chips  are  assembled  in  a  6  pin  DIP 
package,  providing  7.5KV  AC  (PEAK)  of  insulation 
between  the  LED  and  the  output  detector.  These 
output  detector  chips  are  designed  to  drive  triacs 
controlling  loads  on  115  and  220V  AC  power  lines. 
The detector chip is a complex device which functions 
in  the  same  manner  as  a  small  triac,  generating  the 
signals  necessary  to  drive  the  gate  of  a  larger  triac 
such  as  Fairchild’s  FKPF12N60.  The  MOC30XX  triacs 
are  capable  of  controlling  larger  power  triacs  with  a 
minimum number of additional components [13].

5.  WORKING  
The whole System incorporates three sub sections  

 
 
 

ACD (Automatic Collision Detection) 
Automatic Gate Control 
Automatic Tunnel lighting 

The system works in compatibility with these subsections 
which functions together to  provide railway a full-fledged 
railway security and safety mechanism.  
5.1  ACD (Automatic Collision Detection) 
This  system  is  designed  to  automatically  detect  any 
Collision with other locomotives as well as any obstruction 
from any other obstruction from vehicles or other objects 
and level crossings. Anti-Collision Devices have knowledge 
fixed  intelligence.  They  take  inputs  from  Sensors  for 
proximity  updates  and  take  decisions  for  timely  auto-
application of brakes to prevent dangerous ‘collisions’. 

ACDs  fitted  (both  in  Locomotive  and  Guard’s  Van  of  a 
train)  act  as  a  watchdog  in  the  dark  as  they  constantly 
remain  in  lookout  for  other  train  bound  ACDs,  within  the 
braking distance required for their relative speeds.  
5.2  Automatic Gate Control 

The  use  of  Automatic  Gate  Control  evolved  from 
the increase in number of accidents at railway crossings. A 
sensor is placed at certain  proximity of railway  gate  to 
detect the train. When a train comes it detects the train 
and displayed it on the monitor and then it controls the 
railway  gate  and 
railway  accident 
automatically.

5.3  Automatic Tunnel Lighting  

When  the  train  is  passing  through  the  tunnel 
area  then  weight  of  the  train  is  transferred  to  the 
switches  fitted under the  track due  to  which the  circuit 
completes the  current flows through the  circuit and the 
bulb starts glowing under the  tunnel. When the  train is 
passed  out  of  the  tunnel  then  weight  of  the  train  is 
removed from the switch and bulb stops glowing.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
Indian  Railways  is  the  lifeline  of  India.  To  make  it  a 
safe and reliable is a challenge. The Railways has the 
most 
inter-dependent  attributes.  Safety  on  the 
Railways is the end product of the cohesive fusion of 
its myriad parts. A single flaw in the 64,600 route kms 
of  track  that  criss-cross  the  country,  a  defect  in over 
9,500  locos,  55,000  coaches  and  2.39  lakh  wagons 
that haul about 23 million passengers and nearly 2.7 

million  tons  of  freight  every  day  [1],  an  incorrect 
indication on one of the thousands of signals that dot 
the  rail  landscape,  a  mistake  or  an  act  of  negligence 
by  one  of  its  staff  directly  associated  with  train 
running, even a rash act by one of the millions of road 
users  who  daily  negotiate  around  odd  level  crossing 
gates  spread  across  the  system,  an  irresponsible  act 
of  carrying  inflammable  goods  –  any  one  of  these 
multiple  possibilities  has  the  potential  to  cause  a 
major tragedy. Added to these are the acts of sabotage 
by  misguided  elements  spanning  the  whole  country. 
Thus  utmost  vigil  is  safety  in  operations  and  also 
security  of  the  traveling  public  is  accorded  by  the 
Railways.  Railway  safety  is  a  crucial  aspect  of  rail 
operation over the world. The chart below shows the 
relationship  of  movement  of  traffic  to  that  of  the 
occurrence of accidents from 1960 to 2010 [2].

Accidents  at  railway  crossings  are  mainly  due  to  the

personals.  This  model  deals  with  two  prospects. 
Firstly,  it  deals  with  the  reduction  of  time  for  which 
the gate is being kept shut. And secondly, to  provide 
safety to the road users by reducing the accidents that 
usually occur due to carelessness of road users and at 
times  errors  made  by  the  gatekeepers.  In  order  to 
achieve  the  desired  goal,  sensors  are  placed  at  some

utilized  a  pressure  sensor  with  IR  sensors  for  the 
detection of vehicles and the locomotive respectively 
[7]. However in this system the reliability of pressure 
based  sensing  approach  is  less  since  the  pressure 
sensor  cannot  distinguish  between  vehicles  on  and 
around the railway crossing also it cannot function in 
a  potential  collision  wherein  both  the  vehicle  and 
locomotive  are  approaching,  the  determination  of 
presence  of  a  vehicle  will  be  an  issue  due  to  the 
weight of the track also the life of the sensor will not 
be  much  due  to  the  movement  of  heavy  locomotives 
over it. Another model was discussed by Cai Guoqiang 
et.al  on  Rail  Safety  Security  System  which  involved 
integrating  several  existing  railway  safety  and 
security systems on a whole involving monitoring and 
early warning, risk assessment, predictive control and 
emergency rescue system [8]. Since the integration of 
the  existing  system  will  be  cumbersome  task  it  will

to  work 
incorporating themselves with  each other which will 
include  huge  capital  investment  and  the  resultant 
system will be very complex in nature turning out to 
be very less reliable. Emad Aboelela et.al proposed a 
model  of  Wireless  Sensor  Network  Based  Model  for 
Secure  Railway  Operations  involving  the  use  of 
accelerometers  and  ultrasonic  sensors  capable 
enough  to  detect  wear  on  the  rail  and  breakages  in 
them  however  the  accumulation  and  detection  of 
WSN  requires  large  amount  of  time  and  complex 
technicalities. In a condition where real time decision 
making  is  required  the  current  system  will  fail  to

3.  QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS 
The 
“accident‟  covers  a  wide  area  of 
occurrences with or without significant impact on the 
system,  Consecutive  train  accidents  include  mishaps 
with serious outcomes in  terms of loss of human  life 
and 
railway  property  or 
interruption  in  rail  traffic.  These  consequential  train 
accidents 
in 
trains,  road  vehicles  colliding  with  trains  at  level 
crossings, 
of 
“miscellaneous‟ train mishaps. 

include  collisions,  derailments,  fire

3.1  Collisions and Derailments

the  collisions  and 
derailments  in  Indian  railways  due  to  the  failure  of

train.  The  signal  about  the  departure  is  sent  to  the 
microcontroller,  which  in  turn  operates  the  motor 
and opens the gate. Thus, the time for which the gate 
is  closed  is  less  compared  to  the  manually  operated 
gates  since  the  gate  is  closed  depending  upon  the 
telephone  call 
from  the  previous  station.  Also 
reliability  is  high,  as  it  is  not  subjected  to  manual 
errors. The peoples of present age are using the fossil 
fuels  very  rapidly  for  electricity  generation  and  for 
domestic purpose. If with the same rate the fossil fuel 
is in use then in next 35 to 40 years they are going to 
be extinct and we are in a deep trouble. The rationale 
behind  this  concept  is  to  produce  the  electrical 
potential  with  help  of  mechanical  work.  At  present, 
lights  of  railway  tunnels  are  glowing  permanently 
which is not necessary but by this concept, lights are 
allowed to glow at the time when it is required. Since 
there  are  a  large  number  of  railway  tunnels  in  India 
so by applying this concept large amount of electrical 
energy  can  be  saved  which  is  generated  by  non-
renewable sources energy like coal. 
2.  RESEARCH FOUNDATION 
ITS  (Intelligent  Traffic  System)  is  a  topic  of  huge 
concern  to  our  developing  world  and  a  lot  of  prior 
research  has  been  done  but  due  to  diversities  of 
technologies  and  fields.  The  absence  of  a  unified 
system  exists.  Acy  M.  Kottalil  et.al  proposed  a  model 
of  Automatic  Railway  Gate  Control  System  using  IR 
sensors  for  detection  of  trains  at  railway  crossings 
and  controlling  level  crossing  gates  accordingly  [3]. 
But  the  system  is  considered  to  be  very  less  reliable 
due  to  the  presence  of  very  highly  sensitive  IR 
sensors which is  considered to compromise with the 
sensing  in  the  presence  of  sunlight.  Anjali  Jain  et.al 
came  up  with  a  Collision  Detection  and  Avoidance 
System 
in  Railways  Using  WiMAX  the  system 
incorporated  4G  WiMAX  with  GPS  for  calculation 
location of equipped locomotives the system is able to 
clarify  the  fact  that  one  to  one  collisions  can  be 
avoided  by  using  it  however  a  decrement  in  one  to 
one  collisions  is  observed  with  the  use  of  advanced 
automatic signaling in railways [4]. Since this system 
might not be able to report collisions at level crossing 
considering  accidents  at 
crossings  are 
considerably  trending  the  capital  invested  in  the 
system  will  not  be  efficient  enough.  Another 
microcontroller  based  approach  was  discussed  by 
Krishna et.al using 8952 microcontroller and sensors 
to  sense  the  location  of  train  and  act  accordingly  to 
control  the  movement  of  level  crossing  [6].  But  the 
use  of  a  small  scale  approach  for  a  really  complex 
network  will  not  be  sufficient  enough  to  uphold  the 
requirements  of  railways  also  the  reliability  of  the 
system  will  not  be  good  enough.  A  PLC  based 
approach  was  followed  by  Mahesh  Nandaniya  et.al 
with real time monitoring using SCADA the approach 
is  reliable  but  the  capital  investment  in  every  level 
crossing by single PLC will result inefficient in a way 
since there is a very  large quantity  of level crossings 
and controlling every level crossing with a PLC of its 
own  will  increase  the  capital  cost  by  many  folds  [6].

3.3  Railway Crossings 
Elimination  of  Level  Crossings  is  a  gigantic  task  and 
involves  lot  of  manpower,  resources  and  budgetary 
support. It is a continuous process and is done as per 
need,  inter-se  priority  of  works,  availability  of  funds 
and co-operation of State Government, particularly, in 
getting  consent  of  closure  of  level  crossing  and 
undertaking  to  maintain  road and drainage in  future 
for  subways.  The  details  of  railway  accidents 
occurred  at  Level  Crossings  from  the  year  2002-03 
and onwards are given below [11].

4.1  IR Sensors 
The  IR  Sensor-Single  is  a  general  purpose  proximity 
sensor.  Here  we  use  it  for  collision  detection.  The 
module consists of an IR emitter and IR receiver pair. 
The  high  precision  IR  receiver  always  detects  an  IR

4.3  MOC 3021 
The  MOC30XX  family  of  non-zero  crossing  triac 
drivers  consist  of  an  aluminum  gallium  arsenide 
infrared  LED,  optically  coupled  to  a  silicon  detector 
chip.  These  two  chips  are  assembled  in  a  6  pin  DIP 
package,  providing  7.5KV  AC  (PEAK)  of  insulation 
between  the  LED  and  the  output  detector.  These 
output  detector  chips  are  designed  to  drive  triacs 
controlling  loads  on  115  and  220V  AC  power  lines. 
The detector chip is a complex device which functions 
in  the  same  manner  as  a  small  triac,  generating  the 
signals  necessary  to  drive  the  gate  of  a  larger  triac 
such  as  Fairchild’s  FKPF12N60.  The  MOC30XX  triacs 
are  capable  of  controlling  larger  power  triacs  with  a 
minimum number of additional components [13].

5.  WORKING  
The whole System incorporates three sub sections  

 
 
 

ACD (Automatic Collision Detection) 
Automatic Gate Control 
Automatic Tunnel lighting 

The system works in compatibility with these subsections 
which functions together to  provide railway a full-fledged 
railway security and safety mechanism.  
5.1  ACD (Automatic Collision Detection) 
This  system  is  designed  to  automatically  detect  any 
Collision with other locomotives as well as any obstruction 
from any other obstruction from vehicles or other objects 
and level crossings. Anti-Collision Devices have knowledge 
fixed  intelligence.  They  take  inputs  from  Sensors  for 
proximity  updates  and  take  decisions  for  timely  auto-
application of brakes to prevent dangerous ‘collisions’. 

ACDs  fitted  (both  in  Locomotive  and  Guard’s  Van  of  a 
train)  act  as  a  watchdog  in  the  dark  as  they  constantly 
remain  in  lookout  for  other  train  bound  ACDs,  within  the 
braking distance required for their relative speeds.  
5.2  Automatic Gate Control 

The  use  of  Automatic  Gate  Control  evolved  from 
the increase in number of accidents at railway crossings. A 
sensor is placed at certain  proximity of railway  gate  to 
detect the train. When a train comes it detects the train 
and displayed it on the monitor and then it controls the 
railway  gate  and 
railway  accident 
automatically.

5.3  Automatic Tunnel Lighting  

When  the  train  is  passing  through  the  tunnel 
area  then  weight  of  the  train  is  transferred  to  the 
switches  fitted under the  track due  to  which the  circuit 
completes the  current flows through the  circuit and the 
bulb starts glowing under the  tunnel. When the  train is 
passed  out  of  the  tunnel  then  weight  of  the  train  is 
removed from the switch and bulb stops glowing.
