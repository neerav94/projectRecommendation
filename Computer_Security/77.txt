communities  by  generating  alert  in  their  regional  language  when 
they  beyond  other  country’s  border  means  whan  they  cross  the 
international boundary. 

 This application works using GSP application, now a day GPS 
application  is  used  in  many  sector  like  as  map-making,  land 
surveying,  commerce,  scientific  uses,  tracking  and  surveillance.  
Recreationally,  GPS  is  used  for  providing  accurate  locations  and 
as  a  navigation  tool  for  hikers,  hunters  and  also  in  fishing  for 
Fishermen for many purpose like as tracing or monitoring specific 
boat, get position of their current location and using some type of 
instrument  fishermen  also  send  some  type  of  emergency  message 
at  Coastal  Department  from  fishing  boat  in  sea.  From  fishing 
many people get Employment in many state of India. Among other 
state Gujarat has largest coastline. 

II.  TOPOGRAPHY AND LOCATION 

Gujarat  is  located  on  the  Western  coast  of  India  and  has  the 
longest  coastline  of  1,600  km  in  the  country.  The  state  shares  its 
border  with  Rajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra  and  the 
Union  Territories  of  Daman  &  Diu  and  Dadra  &  Nagar  Haveli. 
The Arabian Sea borders the state both to the West and the South-
West.  This  coastline  is  characterized  by  numerous  creeks,  small 
bays  and  rivulets.The  northern  Gujarat  coast  has  several  large 
creeks,  some  of  which  lie  astride  the  international  border  with 
Pakistan.  These  creeks  are  all  inter-connected  by  smaller  water 
bodies  and  together  they  create  an  intricate  maze  of  shallow  and 
deep  channels.However,  the  Kutch  and  Saurashtra  regions  of 
Gujarat,  in  particular,  are  fast  emerging  as  an  industrial  and 
energy  hub.  Jakhau  of  Kutch  district,  Porbandar,  Mangrol,  and 
Veraval which are those cities immigrated at the Arabic Sea. 

So, fishing business grows near at coastline area of those cities. 
All  type  of  fish  grows  in  those  area but fishermen don’t get good 
price from that type of fish for good price they should catch some 
specific  type  of  fish like as lalpari (red  snapper).This type of fish 
and more fish grows at near India – Pakistan border area. It called 
as 
international  maritime  boundary  (international  maritime 
border).  For  Solicitation  fishing  of  more  fish  and  lalpari  type  of 
fish, fisherman straying at  India – Pakistan border and some time 
they  cross  India  –  Pakistan border. Most of time they don’t know 
when  they  cross  India  –  Pakistan  border.  It  is  not  legal  to  stray 
into other country territorial water. 

III.   FISHERMEN  STRAYING  INTO  TERRITORIAL 
WATER 

Government  has  defined  that  if  fishermen  found  in  straying  in 
other  country  territorial  water  then  they  should  pay  find  to 
Government. If Indian fishermen are straying into territorial water 
then  Pakistan  Marine  Security  Agency  (PMSA)  arrest  them 
because  it  is  not  legal.    like  this  both  Indian  and  Pakistani 
fishermen  straying  into  each  other’s  territorial  waters  and  arrest

communities  by  generating  alert  in  their  regional  language  when 
they  beyond  other  country’s  border  means  whan  they  cross  the 
international boundary. 

 This application works using GSP application, now a day GPS

Gujarat  is  located  on  the  Western  coast  of  India  and  has  the 
longest  coastline  of  1,600  km  in  the  country.  The  state  shares  its 
border  with  Rajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra  and  the 
Union  Territories  of  Daman  &  Diu  and  Dadra  &  Nagar  Haveli. 
The Arabian Sea borders the state both to the West and the South-
West.  This  coastline  is  characterized  by  numerous  creeks,  small 
bays  and  rivulets.The  northern  Gujarat  coast  has  several  large 
creeks,  some  of  which  lie  astride  the  international  border  with

Veraval which are those cities immigrated at the Arabic Sea. 

So, fishing business grows near at coastline area of those cities. 
All  type  of  fish  grows  in  those  area but fishermen don’t get good 
price from that type of fish for good price they should catch some 
specific  type  of  fish like as lalpari (red  snapper).This type of fish 
and more fish grows at near India – Pakistan border area. It called

they  cross  India  –  Pakistan border. Most of time they don’t know 
when  they  cross  India  –  Pakistan  border.  It  is  not  legal  to  stray 
into other country territorial water. 

III.   FISHERMEN  STRAYING  INTO  TERRITORIAL 
WATER 

Government  has  defined  that  if  fishermen  found  in  straying  in 
other  country  territorial  water  then  they  should  pay  find  to 
Government. If Indian fishermen are straying into territorial water 
then  Pakistan  Marine  Security  Agency  (PMSA)  arrest  them 
because  it  is  not  legal.    like  this  both  Indian  and  Pakistani 
fishermen  straying  into  each  other’s  territorial  waters  and  arrest

by each other Marine Security Agency.  

This  problem  is  primarily  concentrated  along  the  Gujarat 
coastline because number of arrested fishermen is more in Gujarat 
then  other  state  of  Gujarat.  Most  of Gujarati fishermen are arrest 
along with their boats. So, it remains a serious security problem. 

Hundreds  of  fishermen  are  arrested  by  the  Coast  Guards  of 
both  nations,  but  obtaining  their  release  is  difficult  and  long-
winded  owing  to  the  hostile  relations  between  the  two  nations. 
This  type  of  violations  occurs  due  to  the  absence  of  a  physical 
boundary  and  lack  of  navigational  tools  for  small  fishermen.    In 
addition,  there  is  the  difficulty  of  keeping  a  vigil  on  fishermen 
who  gather  in  their  thousands  at  small  harbours.  For  instance, 
Jakhau  is  a  small  harbour  in  the  Kutch  coast,  where  tens  of 
thousands  of  fishermen  gather  during  the  fishing  season.  The 
place  has  a  small  Coast  Guard  station  as  well  as  a  Customs 
station. 

The  cities  those  at  Coastal  line  area  are  Jakhau  of  Kutch 
district  and  other  city  of  saurashtra  region,  including  vanakbori, 
diu,  porbander,  veraval  and  mangrol.  The  issue  of  arrest  to 
Gujarati  Fishermen  raise  every  time  when  they  cross  the 
international border. So, I have also mentioned some of news from 
the  times  of  India.The  Pakistani  Marine  Security  agency  has 
arrested  ten  Gujarat  fishermen and have seized four fishing boats 
from  Jakhau  on  the  west  coast  of  Kutch  district,  a  National  Fish 
Forum official said. "The Pakistani agency arrested the fishermen 
on  Friday  and  seized  four  fishing  boats  belonging  to  Porbandar," 
National  Fish  Forum  secretary  Manish  Lodhari  said.  The  four 
fishing  boats  --  Raj  Rajeshwari,  Hari  Prasad,  Raj  Mukat  and 
Vinayak -- seized by the agency have been taken away to Karachi 
,  he  claimed.(News:  The  times  of  India.  Date:  January  9,  2002

IV. Instruments of Coastal Security 

To  prevent  Indian  fishermen  from  crossing  over  the  notional 
internal  maritime  boundary  with  Pakistan,  state  government  and 
central  government  has  define  some  technology  for  different  type 
of work.  That technologies used by coastal security and fishermen 
to  prevent  from  Calamity  and  check  their  current  location  and 
navigate their boat. Such technology is there 

A.  Distress Alert Transmitters (DAT) 

This  device  was jointly developed by the Indian Coast Guard and 
the  Indian  Space  Research  Organization  (ISRO)  for  fishermen. 
INSAT  based  Distress  Alert  Transmitter  (DAT)  is  used  to 
transmit  Emergency  conditions  and  position  location  to  a  central 
HUB station via UHF transponder of INSAT for rescue operation. 

 It  can  be  easily  installed  in  boats  or  other  vehicles.  In  case  of 
emergency,  user  just  needs  to  switch  on  the  DAT  unit.  User  is 
required  to  select  a  message  (e.g.:  fire  in  boat  /  boat  sinking  / 
medical  help  /  other  emergency)  by  pressing  the  corresponding 
switch  provided  in  the  system.  The  crew  has  to  press  the 
appropriate  switch  for  the  DAT  emits  a  signal,  which  is 
transmitted  through  a  satellite  to  the  coast  guard.  The  DAT 
combines  the  message  with  position  of  the  boat  obtained through 
GPS,  and  transmits  the  same  to  a  central HUB station. The DAT 
will  repeat  the  message  every  minute  for  first  five  minutes  and 
then every five minutes till it is switched off manually or until the 
battery life gets over. 

Situations  like  medical  emergency,  fire  on  board,  sinking  or 
capture  of  boats  can  be  reported  to  authorities  on  shore  for 
immediate  action.  The  transmitter  operates  through  a  DRT 

transponder  and  can  send  continuous  alerts  for  24  hours  once 
every five minutes on an average, while staff at the rescue centers 
track  the  boat  as  it  appears  on  a  GIS  map  on  their  computer 
screens. 

FEATURES 

  Low cost and therefore affordable to fishing community. 

  In-built GPS to give position and time information. 

  Transmits emergency signal on manual activation. 

  Test transmission facility. 

  Continuous  transmission  on  activation  for  24  hrs  at  5 

minutes intervals. 

  Omni directional antenna suitable for fishing fleet 

  Available with bracket suitable for pole/canopy mounting. 

  Receives  time  of activation, type of emergency, vessel ID 
and position along with audio alarm at Maritime Rescue 
Coordination Centre (MRCC) of Indian Coast Guard. 

  Light weight & floatable. 

 

B.  Vessel Traffic Management System 
(VTMS) 

The  VTMS  system  is  spread  across  entire  coastal  area  of  the 
Gulf  of  Khambhat,  where  in  Ghogha,  Sartanpur,  Mahuva, 
Jafrabad,  Dahej,  Magdalla,  Hazira  and  Sultanabad    installations 
for Radar, AIS, DF, VHF, MET have & Hydro etc. All the stations 
are  connected  to  the  Master  Control  Station  (MCS)  at  Hazira 
through  microwave  link,  using  repeater  stations  at  Alang  and 
Bhagwa. The system provides complete surface water surveillance 
with  two  Emergency  Response  Centers,  one  at  Coast  Guard  and 
one  at  GMB  H.O.,  Gandhinagar  that  covering  the  entire  Gulf  of 
Khambhat. 

The  VTMS  system  is  operated  in  accordance  with  IALA 
guidelines. The VTMS operators are fully trained according to the 
IALA  V-103  standards  for  VTS  operation  by  highly  qualified 
professions from U.K., which include master mariners. 

The 

system 

includes 

integrated  RADAR,  Automatic 
Identification  System  (AIS),  and  Radio  Direction  Finders  (RDF), 
Metrological  and  Hydrological  sensors,  Microwave  links  as  well 
as  VOIP  based  Very  High  Frequency  (VHF)  radio  system.  All 
maritime  traffic  is  recorded,  and  movements  are  stored  in  a 
database.

Fishermen for many purpose like as tracing or monitoring specific 
boat, get position of their current location and using some type of 
instrument  fishermen  also  send  some  type  of  emergency  message 
at  Coastal  Department  from  fishing  boat  in  sea.  From  fishing 
many people get Employment in many state of India. Among other 
state Gujarat has largest coastline. 

II.  TOPOGRAPHY AND LOCATION 

Gujarat  is  located  on  the  Western  coast  of  India  and  has  the 
longest  coastline  of  1,600  km  in  the  country.  The  state  shares  its 
border  with  Rajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra  and  the 
Union  Territories  of  Daman  &  Diu  and  Dadra  &  Nagar  Haveli. 
The Arabian Sea borders the state both to the West and the South-
West.  This  coastline  is  characterized  by  numerous  creeks,  small 
bays  and  rivulets.The  northern  Gujarat  coast  has  several  large 
creeks,  some  of  which  lie  astride  the  international  border  with 
Pakistan.  These  creeks  are  all  inter-connected  by  smaller  water 
bodies  and  together  they  create  an  intricate  maze  of  shallow  and 
deep  channels.However,  the  Kutch  and  Saurashtra  regions  of 
Gujarat,  in  particular,  are  fast  emerging  as  an  industrial  and 
energy  hub.  Jakhau  of  Kutch  district,  Porbandar,  Mangrol,  and 
Veraval which are those cities immigrated at the Arabic Sea. 

So, fishing business grows near at coastline area of those cities. 
All  type  of  fish  grows  in  those  area but fishermen don’t get good 
price from that type of fish for good price they should catch some 
specific  type  of  fish like as lalpari (red  snapper).This type of fish 
and more fish grows at near India – Pakistan border area. It called 
as 
international  maritime  boundary  (international  maritime 
border).  For  Solicitation  fishing  of  more  fish  and  lalpari  type  of 
fish, fisherman straying at  India – Pakistan border and some time 
they  cross  India  –  Pakistan border. Most of time they don’t know 
when  they  cross  India  –  Pakistan  border.  It  is  not  legal  to  stray 
into other country territorial water. 

III.   FISHERMEN  STRAYING  INTO  TERRITORIAL 
WATER 

Government  has  defined  that  if  fishermen  found  in  straying  in 
other  country  territorial  water  then  they  should  pay  find  to 
Government. If Indian fishermen are straying into territorial water 
then  Pakistan  Marine  Security  Agency  (PMSA)  arrest  them 
because  it  is  not  legal.    like  this  both  Indian  and  Pakistani 
fishermen  straying  into  each  other’s  territorial  waters  and  arrest

by each other Marine Security Agency.  

This  problem  is  primarily  concentrated  along  the  Gujarat 
coastline because number of arrested fishermen is more in Gujarat 
then  other  state  of  Gujarat.  Most  of Gujarati fishermen are arrest 
along with their boats. So, it remains a serious security problem. 

Hundreds  of  fishermen  are  arrested  by  the  Coast  Guards  of 
both  nations,  but  obtaining  their  release  is  difficult  and  long-
winded  owing  to  the  hostile  relations  between  the  two  nations. 
This  type  of  violations  occurs  due  to  the  absence  of  a  physical 
boundary  and  lack  of  navigational  tools  for  small  fishermen.    In 
addition,  there  is  the  difficulty  of  keeping  a  vigil  on  fishermen 
who  gather  in  their  thousands  at  small  harbours.  For  instance, 
Jakhau  is  a  small  harbour  in  the  Kutch  coast,  where  tens  of 
thousands  of  fishermen  gather  during  the  fishing  season.  The 
place  has  a  small  Coast  Guard  station  as  well  as  a  Customs 
station. 

The  cities  those  at  Coastal  line  area  are  Jakhau  of  Kutch 
district  and  other  city  of  saurashtra  region,  including  vanakbori, 
diu,  porbander,  veraval  and  mangrol.  The  issue  of  arrest  to 
Gujarati  Fishermen  raise  every  time  when  they  cross  the 
international border. So, I have also mentioned some of news from 
the  times  of  India.The  Pakistani  Marine  Security  agency  has 
arrested  ten  Gujarat  fishermen and have seized four fishing boats 
from  Jakhau  on  the  west  coast  of  Kutch  district,  a  National  Fish 
Forum official said. "The Pakistani agency arrested the fishermen 
on  Friday  and  seized  four  fishing  boats  belonging  to  Porbandar," 
National  Fish  Forum  secretary  Manish  Lodhari  said.  The  four 
fishing  boats  --  Raj  Rajeshwari,  Hari  Prasad,  Raj  Mukat  and 
Vinayak -- seized by the agency have been taken away to Karachi 
,  he  claimed.(News:  The  times  of  India.  Date:  January  9,  2002

IV. Instruments of Coastal Security 

To  prevent  Indian  fishermen  from  crossing  over  the  notional 
internal  maritime  boundary  with  Pakistan,  state  government  and 
central  government  has  define  some  technology  for  different  type 
of work.  That technologies used by coastal security and fishermen 
to  prevent  from  Calamity  and  check  their  current  location  and 
navigate their boat. Such technology is there 

A.  Distress Alert Transmitters (DAT) 

This  device  was jointly developed by the Indian Coast Guard and 
the  Indian  Space  Research  Organization  (ISRO)  for  fishermen. 
INSAT  based  Distress  Alert  Transmitter  (DAT)  is  used  to 
transmit  Emergency  conditions  and  position  location  to  a  central 
HUB station via UHF transponder of INSAT for rescue operation. 

 It  can  be  easily  installed  in  boats  or  other  vehicles.  In  case  of 
emergency,  user  just  needs  to  switch  on  the  DAT  unit.  User  is 
required  to  select  a  message  (e.g.:  fire  in  boat  /  boat  sinking  / 
medical  help  /  other  emergency)  by  pressing  the  corresponding 
switch  provided  in  the  system.  The  crew  has  to  press  the 
appropriate  switch  for  the  DAT  emits  a  signal,  which  is 
transmitted  through  a  satellite  to  the  coast  guard.  The  DAT 
combines  the  message  with  position  of  the  boat  obtained through 
GPS,  and  transmits  the  same  to  a  central HUB station. The DAT 
will  repeat  the  message  every  minute  for  first  five  minutes  and 
then every five minutes till it is switched off manually or until the 
battery life gets over. 

Situations  like  medical  emergency,  fire  on  board,  sinking  or 
capture  of  boats  can  be  reported  to  authorities  on  shore  for 
immediate  action.  The  transmitter  operates  through  a  DRT 

transponder  and  can  send  continuous  alerts  for  24  hours  once 
every five minutes on an average, while staff at the rescue centers 
track  the  boat  as  it  appears  on  a  GIS  map  on  their  computer 
screens. 

FEATURES 

  Low cost and therefore affordable to fishing community. 

  In-built GPS to give position and time information. 

  Transmits emergency signal on manual activation. 

  Test transmission facility. 

  Continuous  transmission  on  activation  for  24  hrs  at  5 

minutes intervals. 

  Omni directional antenna suitable for fishing fleet 

  Available with bracket suitable for pole/canopy mounting. 

  Receives  time  of activation, type of emergency, vessel ID 
and position along with audio alarm at Maritime Rescue 
Coordination Centre (MRCC) of Indian Coast Guard. 

  Light weight & floatable. 

 

B.  Vessel Traffic Management System 
(VTMS) 

The  VTMS  system  is  spread  across  entire  coastal  area  of  the 
Gulf  of  Khambhat,  where  in  Ghogha,  Sartanpur,  Mahuva, 
Jafrabad,  Dahej,  Magdalla,  Hazira  and  Sultanabad    installations 
for Radar, AIS, DF, VHF, MET have & Hydro etc. All the stations 
are  connected  to  the  Master  Control  Station  (MCS)  at  Hazira 
through  microwave  link,  using  repeater  stations  at  Alang  and 
Bhagwa. The system provides complete surface water surveillance 
with  two  Emergency  Response  Centers,  one  at  Coast  Guard  and 
one  at  GMB  H.O.,  Gandhinagar  that  covering  the  entire  Gulf  of 
Khambhat. 

The  VTMS  system  is  operated  in  accordance  with  IALA 
guidelines. The VTMS operators are fully trained according to the 
IALA  V-103  standards  for  VTS  operation  by  highly  qualified 
professions from U.K., which include master mariners. 

The 

system 

includes 

integrated  RADAR,  Automatic 
Identification  System  (AIS),  and  Radio  Direction  Finders  (RDF), 
Metrological  and  Hydrological  sensors,  Microwave  links  as  well 
as  VOIP  based  Very  High  Frequency  (VHF)  radio  system.  All 
maritime  traffic  is  recorded,  and  movements  are  stored  in  a 
database.

VTMS  software  is  ready  to  integrate  the  Diver  Detection 
System, Long range day & night optical (camera) detection system 
and  long  range  underwater  sonar  based  submarine  detection 
system.  Moreover,  any  port  user  can  avail  the  service  of  VTMS 
Remote  Monitoring  Consol  (RMC)  to  monitor  their  own  ship  as 
well  as  entire  traffic  of  the  Gulf  of  Khambhat,  without  having 
installed their own RADAR and AIS system. 

Apart  from  monitoring,  Gulf  of  Khambhat  VTPMS is also one 
and  only  VTMS  in  India  which  provides  all  three  important 
services  like  Information  Service  (IS),  Navigational  Assistance 
Service  (NAS)  and  Traffic  Organizing  Service  (TOS),  as  per 
IALA guidelines.

  RF communications 

C.  Ship Security Alert Systems (SSAS) 

The  Ship  Security  Alert  System  (SSAS)  is  one  safety  measure 
for  strengthening ship security and subduing acts of piracy and/or 
terrorism  against  shipping. Widely  acknowledged  as a part of the 
International  Ship  and  Port  Facility  Security  Code  (ISPS  code), 
the  Ship  Security  Alert  System  (SSAS)  complements 
the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s attempts to increase 
maritime vessel security. When your ship is under attack an SSAS 
report, which contains your ships name, MMSI No., position, etc. 
is  sent  to  up  to  five  locations,  specified  by  the  ship’s  captain  or 
authorized  personnel.  No  audible  or  visible  alarm  is  generated 
while  the  SSAS  report  is  being  transmitted,  to  prevent  discovery 
of the report by the intruders. 

The SSAS is protected with a password to prevent unauthorized 
setting  or  testing  of  it  by  other  than  the  ship’s  captain  or 
authorized personnel. 

How SSAS works? 

When the maritime security staffs comprehend probable danger 
from  pirates  or  terrorists  a  Ship  Security  Alert  System  (SSAS) 
alert is triggered. 

The  beacon  transmits  a  specific  country  code,  reacting  to  which 

the  Rescue  Coordination  Centres  (RCCs)  or  SAR  Points  of 

Contact (SPOCs) of that particular region is notified discreetly. 

Once  receiving  the  signal  the  national  authorities  of  the  area 

notified dispatch appropriate military or law-enforcement forces to 

deal with the terrorist or pirate menace. 

 

D. Automatic Identification System(AIS) 

Automatic  Identification  System  is  a  system  of  transponders 
installed  on  vessels  which  transmit  over  two  dedicated  digital 
marine  VHF  channels.    The  data  is  sent  from  each  vessel  every 
few  seconds  and  contains  position  and  movement  information 
such  as  course,  speed,  latitude,  longitude,  and  rate  of turn. Static 
information  about  the  vessel  is  sent  every  few  minutes  and 
includes the name, type of ship, length, beam, draft, etc. 

Nearly  all  commercial  ships  are  mandated  to  carry  AIS 
transponders and each year more yachts, launches and work boats 
are  fitting  AIS  transponders.  You  can  receive  this  data  with  an 
AIS  receiver  which  translates  the  digital  radio  signals  or  you  can 
receive as well as send your own information with a transponder. 

V. How to solve the problem of Gujarati 
fishermen 

The Arabian Sea around the Gulf of Kutch and across Kori Creek 
and  Sir  Creek  –  the  mouth  of  the  Indus  Delta  -  is  where  a  large 
number  of  fishermen  from  Pakistan  and  India  congregate  to  earn 
their  livelihood.  This  is  also  the  region  from  where  most  of  the 
fishermen  are  arrested.  These  fishermen  are  arrested  for  alleged 
violation  of  maritime  boundaries  and  also  territorial  waters,  in 
some cases. A 

numbers  of  arrested  Pakistani  and  Indian  fishermen  have  told  a 
South  Asian  Labour  Forum  (SALF)  Fact  Finding  Team  in  May 
1997  that,  in  the  absence  of  a  visible  demarcation  line,  they  are 
unable to understand whether they have actually 

crossed  the  maritime  boundary  or  not.  Many  of  these  fishermen 
also  said  that  they  were  probably  picked  up  from  their  own 
waters. 

K.  C.  Pande,  the  Commandant  of  the Coast Guard, Porbandar, 
told the Fact Finding Team, "There are no signs on the sea which 
demarcate the sea border. Above all,

GPS  (Global  Positioning  System) is increasingly being used for a 
wide  range  of  applications.  It  provides  reliable  positioning, 
navigation,  and 
to  worldwide  users  on  a 
continuous  basis  in  all  weather,  day  and  night,  anywhere  on  or 
near the Earth. GPS is made up of three segments: Space, Control 
and  User.  GPS  has  become  a  widely  used  aid  to  navigation 
worldwide,  and  a  useful  tool  for  map-making,  land  surveying, 
commerce,  scientific  uses,  tracking  and  surveillance, and hobbies 
such  as  geocaching  and  way  marking.  None  of  the  present  GPS 
systems  satisfy  the  requirements  for  the  safety  of  civilian 
navigation in the sea as the maritime boundary of a country cannot 
be  marked.This  is  review  paper  is  make  use  of  GPS  device  for 
Gujarati  Fishermen  in  the  Sea. The main objective of this review

I.  INTRODUCTION 

On  November  2008 
terrorist  attacks  on  Mumbai—the  
commercial  capital  of  an economically resurgent India left a deep 
and  indelible  impact  on  the  Indian  security  psyche.  The  attacks 
exposed  the  lackadaisical  attitude  of  the  Government, at both the 
Central  and  state  level,  towards  coastal  security  and  the  sheer  ill 
preparedness of the country to combat such terror threats from the 
seas.Unfortunately,  prior  to  the  Mumbai  attacks,  coastal  security 
and  any  related  debate  on  the  subject  had  been  the  exclusive 
preserve  of  the  Indian  Navy, the Coast Guard and some maritime 
specialists.  

The  susceptibility  of  the  Gujarat  coasts  is  primarily  because  of 
their  topography  and  location.  Added  to  this  is  the  issue  of 
straying  of  Indian  fishermen  into  Pakistani territorial waters. The 
existence  of  vital  strategic  installations  along  these coasts further 
compounds  the  problem.Who  suffered  from  varying  degrees  of 
―sea  blindness‖,  securing  the  country's land borders remained the 
dominant discourse and priority on the national security agenda. 

 It is difficult to guard the  entire coastline in a fool-proof manner. 
Hence,  the  realization  by  the  authorities  for  the  urgent  need  to 
subscribe  to  capacity  and  infrastructure  enhancement  of  the 
maritime  agencies 
in  oastal  security  and,  more 
importantly,  creating  seamless  interaction  between  them  .  The 
main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to help to the Guajarati fishermen

communities  by  generating  alert  in  their  regional  language  when 
they  beyond  other  country’s  border  means  whan  they  cross  the 
international boundary. 

 This application works using GSP application, now a day GPS 
application  is  used  in  many  sector  like  as  map-making,  land 
surveying,  commerce,  scientific  uses,  tracking  and  surveillance.  
Recreationally,  GPS  is  used  for  providing  accurate  locations  and 
as  a  navigation  tool  for  hikers,  hunters  and  also  in  fishing  for 
Fishermen for many purpose like as tracing or monitoring specific 
boat, get position of their current location and using some type of 
instrument  fishermen  also  send  some  type  of  emergency  message 
at  Coastal  Department  from  fishing  boat  in  sea.  From  fishing 
many people get Employment in many state of India. Among other 
state Gujarat has largest coastline. 

II.  TOPOGRAPHY AND LOCATION 

Gujarat  is  located  on  the  Western  coast  of  India  and  has  the 
longest  coastline  of  1,600  km  in  the  country.  The  state  shares  its 
border  with  Rajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra  and  the

IV. Instruments of Coastal Security 

To  prevent  Indian  fishermen  from  crossing  over  the  notional 
internal  maritime  boundary  with  Pakistan,  state  government  and 
central  government  has  define  some  technology  for  different  type 
of work.  That technologies used by coastal security and fishermen 
to  prevent  from  Calamity  and  check  their  current  location  and 
navigate their boat. Such technology is there 

A.  Distress Alert Transmitters (DAT) 

This  device  was jointly developed by the Indian Coast Guard and 
the  Indian  Space  Research  Organization  (ISRO)  for  fishermen. 
INSAT  based  Distress  Alert  Transmitter  (DAT)  is  used  to 
transmit  Emergency  conditions  and  position  location  to  a  central 
HUB station via UHF transponder of INSAT for rescue operation. 

 It  can  be  easily  installed  in  boats  or  other  vehicles.  In  case  of 
emergency,  user  just  needs  to  switch  on  the  DAT  unit.  User  is 
required  to  select  a  message  (e.g.:  fire  in  boat  /  boat  sinking  / 
medical  help  /  other  emergency)  by  pressing  the  corresponding 
switch  provided  in  the  system.  The  crew  has  to  press  the 
appropriate  switch  for  the  DAT  emits  a  signal,  which  is 
transmitted  through  a  satellite  to  the  coast  guard.  The  DAT 
combines  the  message  with  position  of  the  boat  obtained through 
GPS,  and  transmits  the  same  to  a  central HUB station. The DAT 
will  repeat  the  message  every  minute  for  first  five  minutes  and 
then every five minutes till it is switched off manually or until the 
battery life gets over. 

Situations  like  medical  emergency,  fire  on  board,  sinking  or 
capture  of  boats  can  be  reported  to  authorities  on  shore  for 
immediate  action.  The  transmitter  operates  through  a  DRT 

transponder  and  can  send  continuous  alerts  for  24  hours  once 
every five minutes on an average, while staff at the rescue centers 
track  the  boat  as  it  appears  on  a  GIS  map  on  their  computer 
screens.

B.  Vessel Traffic Management System 
(VTMS) 

The  VTMS  system  is  spread  across  entire  coastal  area  of  the 
Gulf  of  Khambhat,  where  in  Ghogha,  Sartanpur,  Mahuva, 
Jafrabad,  Dahej,  Magdalla,  Hazira  and  Sultanabad    installations 
for Radar, AIS, DF, VHF, MET have & Hydro etc. All the stations 
are  connected  to  the  Master  Control  Station  (MCS)  at  Hazira 
through  microwave  link,  using  repeater  stations  at  Alang  and 
Bhagwa. The system provides complete surface water surveillance 
with  two  Emergency  Response  Centers,  one  at  Coast  Guard  and 
one  at  GMB  H.O.,  Gandhinagar  that  covering  the  entire  Gulf  of 
Khambhat. 

The  VTMS  system  is  operated  in  accordance  with  IALA 
guidelines. The VTMS operators are fully trained according to the 
IALA  V-103  standards  for  VTS  operation  by  highly  qualified 
professions from U.K., which include master mariners. 

The 

system 

includes 

integrated  RADAR,  Automatic 
Identification  System  (AIS),  and  Radio  Direction  Finders  (RDF), 
Metrological  and  Hydrological  sensors,  Microwave  links  as  well 
as  VOIP  based  Very  High  Frequency  (VHF)  radio  system.  All 
maritime  traffic  is  recorded,  and  movements  are  stored  in  a 
database.

VTMS  software  is  ready  to  integrate  the  Diver  Detection 
System, Long range day & night optical (camera) detection system 
and  long  range  underwater  sonar  based  submarine  detection 
system.  Moreover,  any  port  user  can  avail  the  service  of  VTMS 
Remote  Monitoring  Consol  (RMC)  to  monitor  their  own  ship  as 
well  as  entire  traffic  of  the  Gulf  of  Khambhat,  without  having 
installed their own RADAR and AIS system. 

Apart  from  monitoring,  Gulf  of  Khambhat  VTPMS is also one 
and  only  VTMS  in  India  which  provides  all  three  important 
services  like  Information  Service  (IS),  Navigational  Assistance 
Service  (NAS)  and  Traffic  Organizing  Service  (TOS),  as  per 
IALA guidelines. 

VTMS system consists of:

  Display system 

  RF communications 

C.  Ship Security Alert Systems (SSAS) 

The  Ship  Security  Alert  System  (SSAS)  is  one  safety  measure 
for  strengthening ship security and subduing acts of piracy and/or 
terrorism  against  shipping. Widely  acknowledged  as a part of the 
International  Ship  and  Port  Facility  Security  Code  (ISPS  code), 
the  Ship  Security  Alert  System  (SSAS)  complements 
the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s attempts to increase 
maritime vessel security. When your ship is under attack an SSAS 
report, which contains your ships name, MMSI No., position, etc. 
is  sent  to  up  to  five  locations,  specified  by  the  ship’s  captain  or 
authorized  personnel.  No  audible  or  visible  alarm  is  generated 
while  the  SSAS  report  is  being  transmitted,  to  prevent  discovery 
of the report by the intruders. 

The SSAS is protected with a password to prevent unauthorized 
setting  or  testing  of  it  by  other  than  the  ship’s  captain  or 
authorized personnel. 

How SSAS works? 

When the maritime security staffs comprehend probable danger 
from  pirates  or  terrorists  a  Ship  Security  Alert  System  (SSAS) 
alert is triggered. 

The  beacon  transmits  a  specific  country  code,  reacting  to  which 

the  Rescue  Coordination  Centres  (RCCs)  or  SAR  Points  of 

Contact (SPOCs) of that particular region is notified discreetly. 

Once  receiving  the  signal  the  national  authorities  of  the  area 

notified dispatch appropriate military or law-enforcement forces to 

deal with the terrorist or pirate menace. 

 

D. Automatic Identification System(AIS) 

Automatic  Identification  System  is  a  system  of  transponders 
installed  on  vessels  which  transmit  over  two  dedicated  digital 
marine  VHF  channels.    The  data  is  sent  from  each  vessel  every 
few  seconds  and  contains  position  and  movement  information 
such  as  course,  speed,  latitude,  longitude,  and  rate  of turn. Static 
information  about  the  vessel  is  sent  every  few  minutes  and 
includes the name, type of ship, length, beam, draft, etc. 

Nearly  all  commercial  ships  are  mandated  to  carry  AIS 
transponders and each year more yachts, launches and work boats 
are  fitting  AIS  transponders.  You  can  receive  this  data  with  an 
AIS  receiver  which  translates  the  digital  radio  signals  or  you  can 
receive as well as send your own information with a transponder. 

V. How to solve the problem of Gujarati 
fishermen 

The Arabian Sea around the Gulf of Kutch and across Kori Creek 
and  Sir  Creek  –  the  mouth  of  the  Indus  Delta  -  is  where  a  large 
number  of  fishermen  from  Pakistan  and  India  congregate  to  earn 
their  livelihood.  This  is  also  the  region  from  where  most  of  the 
fishermen  are  arrested.  These  fishermen  are  arrested  for  alleged 
violation  of  maritime  boundaries  and  also  territorial  waters,  in 
some cases. A 

numbers  of  arrested  Pakistani  and  Indian  fishermen  have  told  a 
South  Asian  Labour  Forum  (SALF)  Fact  Finding  Team  in  May 
1997  that,  in  the  absence  of  a  visible  demarcation  line,  they  are 
unable to understand whether they have actually 

crossed  the  maritime  boundary  or  not.  Many  of  these  fishermen 
also  said  that  they  were  probably  picked  up  from  their  own 
waters. 

K.  C.  Pande,  the  Commandant  of  the Coast Guard, Porbandar, 
told the Fact Finding Team, "There are no signs on the sea which 
demarcate the sea border. Above all,

                                                                                     Vol. I, Issue II, September 2012 (ISSN: 2278-7720) 

 
there is no agreed boundary on the Arabian Sea between India and 
Pakistan.  For  their  mutual  convenience,  the  patrolling  agencies 
have worked out an imaginary line along the Sir Creek Region off 
the coast of Kutch.‖ 

This  research  is  base  on  GPS  application. We  can  use  GPS  in 
many  applications  and  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  is  a 
satellite-based  navigation  system  made  up  of  a  network  of  24 
satellites  placed  into  orbit  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense. 
GPS  was  originally  intended  for  military  applications,  but  in  the 
1980s, the government made the system available for civilian use. 
GPS  works  in  any  weather conditions, anywhere in the world, 24 
hours a day. There are no subscription fees or setup charges to use 
GPS.  As  GPS  units  are  becoming  smaller  and  less  expensive, 
there are an expanding number of applications for GPS.  

In transportation applications, GPS assists pilots and drivers in 
pinpointing  their  locations  and  avoiding  collisions.  Farmers  can 
use  GPS  to  guide  equipment  and  control  accurate  distribution  of 
fertilizers  and  other  chemicals.GPS  application  is  used  in  many 
sector  like  as  map-making,  land  surveying,  commerce,  scientific 
uses,  tracking  and  surveillance.  Recreationally,  GPS  is  used  for 
providing  accurate  locations  and  as  a  navigation  tool  for  hikers, 
hunters  and  boaters.  GPS  application  is  also  used  for  Fishermen 
for  navigating  ,  checking  position  of  their  boat  and etc. but today 
this  is  major  issue  that    many  Guajarati fishermen is arrest when 
they are fishing in territorial waters of other nation. 

GPS    based    border    alert  system  gives  a  best  solution  for  
this    problem,  whenever  the  fisherman  was  about  to  reach  the 
boundary  they  can  have  a  voice  based  alert  in  their  native 
language itself. So that they can go back from that point onwards. 

This  GPS  receiver  is  capable    of    identifying    the   location  in  
which  it  was  present  in  the  form  of  latitude  and longitudes.  
This    information    is    very    useful    and    can    be    processed    for  
alerting    the    boat  drivers.  The  GPS  gives the data received from 
the satellites. For this information the GPS communicates with at 
least three satellites in the space. 

The  functioning  of  the  device  is  achieved  by  employing  a  
micro    controller.  The  micro  controller  forms  the  controlling  unit 
of  the  project.    The  micro  controller  is  interfaced  with  a  GPS 
receiver so that it can receive the information about the location in 
which  the  boat  is  present.    The  controller  compares  with  the 
stored  boundary  latitude  and  longitude  positions  of  the  boat  with 
the  territory  location. If the boat is found beyond the border, then 
an alarm is generated with a message in their regional language.  

Gujarati  fishermen  no  need  to  purchase  this  GPS  instrument  if 
they  have  specific  GPS  enabled  mobile  device  then  they  can 
installed this application in their mobile.

Abstract 

timing  services 

GPS  (Global  Positioning  System) is increasingly being used for a 
wide  range  of  applications.  It  provides  reliable  positioning, 
navigation,  and 
to  worldwide  users  on  a 
continuous  basis  in  all  weather,  day  and  night,  anywhere  on  or 
near the Earth. GPS is made up of three segments: Space, Control 
and  User.  GPS  has  become  a  widely  used  aid  to  navigation 
worldwide,  and  a  useful  tool  for  map-making,  land  surveying, 
commerce,  scientific  uses,  tracking  and  surveillance, and hobbies 
such  as  geocaching  and  way  marking.  None  of  the  present  GPS 
systems  satisfy  the  requirements  for  the  safety  of  civilian 
navigation in the sea as the maritime boundary of a country cannot 
be  marked.This  is  review  paper  is  make  use  of  GPS  device  for 
Gujarati  Fishermen  in  the  Sea. The main objective of this review 
paper  to  help  Gujarati  Fishermen  by  providing  alert  when  they 
cross  other  country's  border  and  alert  generate  in  their  regional 
language  this  application  also  works  in  gps  enable  mobile device

I.  INTRODUCTION 

On  November  2008 
terrorist  attacks  on  Mumbai—the  
commercial  capital  of  an economically resurgent India left a deep 
and  indelible  impact  on  the  Indian  security  psyche.  The  attacks 
exposed  the  lackadaisical  attitude  of  the  Government, at both the 
Central  and  state  level,  towards  coastal  security  and  the  sheer  ill 
preparedness of the country to combat such terror threats from the 
seas.Unfortunately,  prior  to  the  Mumbai  attacks,  coastal  security 
and  any  related  debate  on  the  subject  had  been  the  exclusive 
preserve  of  the  Indian  Navy, the Coast Guard and some maritime 
specialists.  

The  susceptibility  of  the  Gujarat  coasts  is  primarily  because  of 
their  topography  and  location.  Added  to  this  is  the  issue  of 
straying  of  Indian  fishermen  into  Pakistani territorial waters. The 
existence  of  vital  strategic  installations  along  these coasts further 
compounds  the  problem.Who  suffered  from  varying  degrees  of 
―sea  blindness‖,  securing  the  country's land borders remained the 
dominant discourse and priority on the national security agenda. 

 It is difficult to guard the  entire coastline in a fool-proof manner. 
Hence,  the  realization  by  the  authorities  for  the  urgent  need  to 
subscribe  to  capacity  and  infrastructure  enhancement  of  the 
maritime  agencies 
in  oastal  security  and,  more 
importantly,  creating  seamless  interaction  between  them  .  The 
main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to help to the Guajarati fishermen 

involved

communities  by  generating  alert  in  their  regional  language  when 
they  beyond  other  country’s  border  means  whan  they  cross  the 
international boundary. 

 This application works using GSP application, now a day GPS 
application  is  used  in  many  sector  like  as  map-making,  land 
surveying,  commerce,  scientific  uses,  tracking  and  surveillance.  
Recreationally,  GPS  is  used  for  providing  accurate  locations  and 
as  a  navigation  tool  for  hikers,  hunters  and  also  in  fishing  for 
Fishermen for many purpose like as tracing or monitoring specific 
boat, get position of their current location and using some type of 
instrument  fishermen  also  send  some  type  of  emergency  message 
at  Coastal  Department  from  fishing  boat  in  sea.  From  fishing 
many people get Employment in many state of India. Among other 
state Gujarat has largest coastline. 

II.  TOPOGRAPHY AND LOCATION 

Gujarat  is  located  on  the  Western  coast  of  India  and  has  the 
longest  coastline  of  1,600  km  in  the  country.  The  state  shares  its 
border  with  Rajasthan,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra  and  the 
Union  Territories  of  Daman  &  Diu  and  Dadra  &  Nagar  Haveli. 
The Arabian Sea borders the state both to the West and the South-
West.  This  coastline  is  characterized  by  numerous  creeks,  small 
bays  and  rivulets.The  northern  Gujarat  coast  has  several  large 
creeks,  some  of  which  lie  astride  the  international  border  with 
Pakistan.  These  creeks  are  all  inter-connected  by  smaller  water 
bodies  and  together  they  create  an  intricate  maze  of  shallow  and 
deep  channels.However,  the  Kutch  and  Saurashtra  regions  of 
Gujarat,  in  particular,  are  fast  emerging  as  an  industrial  and 
energy  hub.  Jakhau  of  Kutch  district,  Porbandar,  Mangrol,  and 
Veraval which are those cities immigrated at the Arabic Sea. 

So, fishing business grows near at coastline area of those cities. 
All  type  of  fish  grows  in  those  area but fishermen don’t get good 
price from that type of fish for good price they should catch some 
specific  type  of  fish like as lalpari (red  snapper).This type of fish 
and more fish grows at near India – Pakistan border area. It called 
as 
international  maritime  boundary  (international  maritime 
border).  For  Solicitation  fishing  of  more  fish  and  lalpari  type  of 
fish, fisherman straying at  India – Pakistan border and some time 
they  cross  India  –  Pakistan border. Most of time they don’t know 
when  they  cross  India  –  Pakistan  border.  It  is  not  legal  to  stray 
into other country territorial water. 

III.   FISHERMEN  STRAYING  INTO  TERRITORIAL 
WATER 

Government  has  defined  that  if  fishermen  found  in  straying  in 
other  country  territorial  water  then  they  should  pay  find  to 
Government. If Indian fishermen are straying into territorial water 
then  Pakistan  Marine  Security  Agency  (PMSA)  arrest  them 
because  it  is  not  legal.    like  this  both  Indian  and  Pakistani

by each other Marine Security Agency.  

This  problem  is  primarily  concentrated  along  the  Gujarat 
coastline because number of arrested fishermen is more in Gujarat 
then  other  state  of  Gujarat.  Most  of Gujarati fishermen are arrest 
along with their boats. So, it remains a serious security problem. 

Hundreds  of  fishermen  are  arrested  by  the  Coast  Guards  of 
both  nations,  but  obtaining  their  release  is  difficult  and  long-
winded  owing  to  the  hostile  relations  between  the  two  nations. 
This  type  of  violations  occurs  due  to  the  absence  of  a  physical 
boundary  and  lack  of  navigational  tools  for  small  fishermen.    In 
addition,  there  is  the  difficulty  of  keeping  a  vigil  on  fishermen 
who  gather  in  their  thousands  at  small  harbours.  For  instance, 
Jakhau  is  a  small  harbour  in  the  Kutch  coast,  where  tens  of 
thousands  of  fishermen  gather  during  the  fishing  season.  The 
place  has  a  small  Coast  Guard  station  as  well  as  a  Customs 
station. 

The  cities  those  at  Coastal  line  area  are  Jakhau  of  Kutch 
district  and  other  city  of  saurashtra  region,  including  vanakbori, 
diu,  porbander,  veraval  and  mangrol.  The  issue  of  arrest  to 
Gujarati  Fishermen  raise  every  time  when  they  cross  the 
international border. So, I have also mentioned some of news from 
the  times  of  India.The  Pakistani  Marine  Security  agency  has 
arrested  ten  Gujarat  fishermen and have seized four fishing boats 
from  Jakhau  on  the  west  coast  of  Kutch  district,  a  National  Fish 
Forum official said. "The Pakistani agency arrested the fishermen 
on  Friday  and  seized  four  fishing  boats  belonging  to  Porbandar," 
National  Fish  Forum  secretary  Manish  Lodhari  said.  The  four 
fishing  boats  --  Raj  Rajeshwari,  Hari  Prasad,  Raj  Mukat  and 
Vinayak -- seized by the agency have been taken away to Karachi 
,  he  claimed.(News:  The  times  of  India.  Date:  January  9,  2002

IV. Instruments of Coastal Security 

To  prevent  Indian  fishermen  from  crossing  over  the  notional 
internal  maritime  boundary  with  Pakistan,  state  government  and 
central  government  has  define  some  technology  for  different  type 
of work.  That technologies used by coastal security and fishermen 
to  prevent  from  Calamity  and  check  their  current  location  and 
navigate their boat. Such technology is there 

A.  Distress Alert Transmitters (DAT) 

This  device  was jointly developed by the Indian Coast Guard and 
the  Indian  Space  Research  Organization  (ISRO)  for  fishermen. 
INSAT  based  Distress  Alert  Transmitter  (DAT)  is  used  to 
transmit  Emergency  conditions  and  position  location  to  a  central 
HUB station via UHF transponder of INSAT for rescue operation. 

 It  can  be  easily  installed  in  boats  or  other  vehicles.  In  case  of 
emergency,  user  just  needs  to  switch  on  the  DAT  unit.  User  is 
required  to  select  a  message  (e.g.:  fire  in  boat  /  boat  sinking  / 
medical  help  /  other  emergency)  by  pressing  the  corresponding 
switch  provided  in  the  system.  The  crew  has  to  press  the 
appropriate  switch  for  the  DAT  emits  a  signal,  which  is 
transmitted  through  a  satellite  to  the  coast  guard.  The  DAT 
combines  the  message  with  position  of  the  boat  obtained through 
GPS,  and  transmits  the  same  to  a  central HUB station. The DAT 
will  repeat  the  message  every  minute  for  first  five  minutes  and 
then every five minutes till it is switched off manually or until the 
battery life gets over. 

Situations  like  medical  emergency,  fire  on  board,  sinking  or 
capture  of  boats  can  be  reported  to  authorities  on  shore  for 
immediate  action.  The  transmitter  operates  through  a  DRT 

transponder  and  can  send  continuous  alerts  for  24  hours  once 
every five minutes on an average, while staff at the rescue centers 
track  the  boat  as  it  appears  on  a  GIS  map  on  their  computer 
screens. 

FEATURES 

  Low cost and therefore affordable to fishing community. 

  In-built GPS to give position and time information. 

  Transmits emergency signal on manual activation.

and position along with audio alarm at Maritime Rescue 
Coordination Centre (MRCC) of Indian Coast Guard. 

  Light weight & floatable. 

 

B.  Vessel Traffic Management System 
(VTMS) 

The  VTMS  system  is  spread  across  entire  coastal  area  of  the 
Gulf  of  Khambhat,  where  in  Ghogha,  Sartanpur,  Mahuva, 
Jafrabad,  Dahej,  Magdalla,  Hazira  and  Sultanabad    installations 
for Radar, AIS, DF, VHF, MET have & Hydro etc. All the stations 
are  connected  to  the  Master  Control  Station  (MCS)  at  Hazira 
through  microwave  link,  using  repeater  stations  at  Alang  and 
Bhagwa. The system provides complete surface water surveillance 
with  two  Emergency  Response  Centers,  one  at  Coast  Guard  and 
one  at  GMB  H.O.,  Gandhinagar  that  covering  the  entire  Gulf  of 
Khambhat. 

The  VTMS  system  is  operated  in  accordance  with  IALA 
guidelines. The VTMS operators are fully trained according to the 
IALA  V-103  standards  for  VTS  operation  by  highly  qualified 
professions from U.K., which include master mariners. 

The 

system 

includes 

integrated  RADAR,  Automatic 
Identification  System  (AIS),  and  Radio  Direction  Finders  (RDF), 
Metrological  and  Hydrological  sensors,  Microwave  links  as  well 
as  VOIP  based  Very  High  Frequency  (VHF)  radio  system.  All 
maritime  traffic  is  recorded,  and  movements  are  stored  in  a 
database.

VTMS  software  is  ready  to  integrate  the  Diver  Detection 
System, Long range day & night optical (camera) detection system 
and  long  range  underwater  sonar  based  submarine  detection 
system.  Moreover,  any  port  user  can  avail  the  service  of  VTMS 
Remote  Monitoring  Consol  (RMC)  to  monitor  their  own  ship  as 
well  as  entire  traffic  of  the  Gulf  of  Khambhat,  without  having 
installed their own RADAR and AIS system. 

Apart  from  monitoring,  Gulf  of  Khambhat  VTPMS is also one 
and  only  VTMS  in  India  which  provides  all  three  important 
services  like  Information  Service  (IS),  Navigational  Assistance 
Service  (NAS)  and  Traffic  Organizing  Service  (TOS),  as  per 
IALA guidelines. 

VTMS system consists of:

  Display system 

  RF communications 

C.  Ship Security Alert Systems (SSAS) 

The  Ship  Security  Alert  System  (SSAS)  is  one  safety  measure 
for  strengthening ship security and subduing acts of piracy and/or 
terrorism  against  shipping. Widely  acknowledged  as a part of the 
International  Ship  and  Port  Facility  Security  Code  (ISPS  code), 
the  Ship  Security  Alert  System  (SSAS)  complements 
the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s attempts to increase 
maritime vessel security. When your ship is under attack an SSAS 
report, which contains your ships name, MMSI No., position, etc. 
is  sent  to  up  to  five  locations,  specified  by  the  ship’s  captain  or 
authorized  personnel.  No  audible  or  visible  alarm  is  generated 
while  the  SSAS  report  is  being  transmitted,  to  prevent  discovery 
of the report by the intruders. 

The SSAS is protected with a password to prevent unauthorized 
setting  or  testing  of  it  by  other  than  the  ship’s  captain  or 
authorized personnel. 

How SSAS works? 

When the maritime security staffs comprehend probable danger 
from  pirates  or  terrorists  a  Ship  Security  Alert  System  (SSAS) 
alert is triggered. 

The  beacon  transmits  a  specific  country  code,  reacting  to  which 

the  Rescue  Coordination  Centres  (RCCs)  or  SAR  Points  of 

Contact (SPOCs) of that particular region is notified discreetly. 

Once  receiving  the  signal  the  national  authorities  of  the  area 

notified dispatch appropriate military or law-enforcement forces to 

deal with the terrorist or pirate menace. 

 

D. Automatic Identification System(AIS) 

Automatic  Identification  System  is  a  system  of  transponders 
installed  on  vessels  which  transmit  over  two  dedicated  digital 
marine  VHF  channels.    The  data  is  sent  from  each  vessel  every 
few  seconds  and  contains  position  and  movement  information 
such  as  course,  speed,  latitude,  longitude,  and  rate  of turn. Static 
information  about  the  vessel  is  sent  every  few  minutes  and 
includes the name, type of ship, length, beam, draft, etc. 

Nearly  all  commercial  ships  are  mandated  to  carry  AIS 
transponders and each year more yachts, launches and work boats 
are  fitting  AIS  transponders.  You  can  receive  this  data  with  an 
AIS  receiver  which  translates  the  digital  radio  signals  or  you  can 
receive as well as send your own information with a transponder. 

V. How to solve the problem of Gujarati 
fishermen 

The Arabian Sea around the Gulf of Kutch and across Kori Creek 
and  Sir  Creek  –  the  mouth  of  the  Indus  Delta  -  is  where  a  large 
number  of  fishermen  from  Pakistan  and  India  congregate  to  earn 
their  livelihood.  This  is  also  the  region  from  where  most  of  the 
fishermen  are  arrested.  These  fishermen  are  arrested  for  alleged 
violation  of  maritime  boundaries  and  also  territorial  waters,  in 
some cases. A 

numbers  of  arrested  Pakistani  and  Indian  fishermen  have  told  a 
South  Asian  Labour  Forum  (SALF)  Fact  Finding  Team  in  May 
1997  that,  in  the  absence  of  a  visible  demarcation  line,  they  are 
unable to understand whether they have actually 

crossed  the  maritime  boundary  or  not.  Many  of  these  fishermen 
also  said  that  they  were  probably  picked  up  from  their  own 
waters. 

K.  C.  Pande,  the  Commandant  of  the Coast Guard, Porbandar, 
told the Fact Finding Team, "There are no signs on the sea which 
demarcate the sea border. Above all,

                                                                                     Vol. I, Issue II, September 2012 (ISSN: 2278-7720) 

 
there is no agreed boundary on the Arabian Sea between India and 
Pakistan.  For  their  mutual  convenience,  the  patrolling  agencies 
have worked out an imaginary line along the Sir Creek Region off 
the coast of Kutch.‖ 

This  research  is  base  on  GPS  application. We  can  use  GPS  in 
many  applications  and  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  is  a 
satellite-based  navigation  system  made  up  of  a  network  of  24 
satellites  placed  into  orbit  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense. 
GPS  was  originally  intended  for  military  applications,  but  in  the 
1980s, the government made the system available for civilian use. 
GPS  works  in  any  weather conditions, anywhere in the world, 24 
hours a day. There are no subscription fees or setup charges to use 
GPS.  As  GPS  units  are  becoming  smaller  and  less  expensive, 
there are an expanding number of applications for GPS.  

In transportation applications, GPS assists pilots and drivers in 
pinpointing  their  locations  and  avoiding  collisions.  Farmers  can 
use  GPS  to  guide  equipment  and  control  accurate  distribution  of 
fertilizers  and  other  chemicals.GPS  application  is  used  in  many 
sector  like  as  map-making,  land  surveying,  commerce,  scientific 
uses,  tracking  and  surveillance.  Recreationally,  GPS  is  used  for 
providing  accurate  locations  and  as  a  navigation  tool  for  hikers, 
hunters  and  boaters.  GPS  application  is  also  used  for  Fishermen 
for  navigating  ,  checking  position  of  their  boat  and etc. but today 
this  is  major  issue  that    many  Guajarati fishermen is arrest when 
they are fishing in territorial waters of other nation. 

GPS    based    border    alert  system  gives  a  best  solution  for  
this    problem,  whenever  the  fisherman  was  about  to  reach  the 
boundary  they  can  have  a  voice  based  alert  in  their  native 
language itself. So that they can go back from that point onwards. 

This  GPS  receiver  is  capable    of    identifying    the   location  in  
which  it  was  present  in  the  form  of  latitude  and longitudes.  
This    information    is    very    useful    and    can    be    processed    for  
alerting    the    boat  drivers.  The  GPS  gives the data received from 
the satellites. For this information the GPS communicates with at 
least three satellites in the space. 

The  functioning  of  the  device  is  achieved  by  employing  a  
micro    controller.  The  micro  controller  forms  the  controlling  unit 
of  the  project.    The  micro  controller  is  interfaced  with  a  GPS 
receiver so that it can receive the information about the location in 
which  the  boat  is  present.    The  controller  compares  with  the 
stored  boundary  latitude  and  longitude  positions  of  the  boat  with 
the  territory  location. If the boat is found beyond the border, then 
an alarm is generated with a message in their regional language.  

Gujarati  fishermen  no  need  to  purchase  this  GPS  instrument  if 
they  have  specific  GPS  enabled  mobile  device  then  they  can 
installed this application in their mobile.

Many  Guajarati    fishermen  arrested  by  Pakistan  Marine 
Security  Agency  (PMSA)  in  the  Arabian  Sea of the Gujarat coast 
on charges of having crossed into Pakistani waters. 

So, it is better that if there is any type of instrument that gives 
alert  in  their  regional  language  to  Gujarati  fishermen  when  they 
cross the international border of other nation. 

So, This type of application that run on specific instrument that 
give alert to fishermen in their regional language when they cross
