An  integrated  security  mechanism  is  one  of  the  key  challenges  in  the  open  wireless  network 
architecture because of the diversity of the wireless network in open wireless network and the unique 
security mechanism used in each one of these networks. Optimized security protocols and mechanisms 
are necessary for the high performance and security concerns. Finally, a challenge and requirement of 
advanced security mechanism will meet the integration of open ubiquitous sensor network with security 
protocols  for  applying  their  applications  in  the  near  future.  We  analyzed  and  surveyed  features  of 
infrastructure and security mechanism of various heterogeneous wireless networks.

Recently, communication environment has been changed very much due to advances in information 
and  communication.  The  current  existing  information  networks  consist  of  the  wired  and  wireless 
network with a split network and the individual networks which can be developed. However, in recent 
years, wired and wireless network are integrated with two-step fusion of traditional wired and wireless 
networks. The network tends to integrate and fuse to set up total topology. With the characteristics of 
various types of wireless networks are advancing due to the needs of users’ demand for their network. 
Therefore, each network is developing with each their characteristics. From the user's perspective, the 
current existing network with integrated wireless communications based on the user-centric network 
architecture is developing new features and fusing with different networks. Depending on needs, the 
characteristics of wireless and mobile communication can be opened in order to realize the structure-

An  integrated  security  mechanism  is  one  of  the  key  challenges  in  the  open  wireless  network 
architecture because of the diversity of the wireless network in open wireless network and the unique 
security mechanism used in each one of these networks. Optimized security protocols and mechanisms 
are necessary for the high performance and security concerns. Finally, a challenge and requirement of 
advanced security mechanism will meet the integration of open ubiquitous sensor network with security 
protocols  for  applying  their  applications  in  the  near  future.  We  analyzed  and  surveyed  features  of 
infrastructure and security mechanism of various heterogeneous wireless networks.

1. Introduction 
 

Recently, communication environment has been changed very much due to advances in information 
and  communication.  The  current  existing  information  networks  consist  of  the  wired  and  wireless 
network with a split network and the individual networks which can be developed. However, in recent 
years, wired and wireless network are integrated with two-step fusion of traditional wired and wireless 
networks. The network tends to integrate and fuse to set up total topology. With the characteristics of 
various types of wireless networks are advancing due to the needs of users’ demand for their network. 
Therefore, each network is developing with each their characteristics. From the user's perspective, the 
current existing network with integrated wireless communications based on the user-centric network 
architecture is developing new features and fusing with different networks. Depending on needs, the 
characteristics of wireless and mobile communication can be opened in order to realize the structure-
based wireless networks that have been developed using the form and needs [1]. 

The recent surge in cyber-attacks as a measure for the "fusion of security and privacy' has emerged 
as the hot-issue in these days. In particular, process of promoting the standards of ITU, such as the 
international organization for standardization in the NGN (Next Generation Network) technology and 
the  next  Internet,  web  technology  by  the  international  organization  for  standardization  fourth-
generation  mobile  communication  technology,  combined  with  the  standardization  of  RFID  (Radio 
Frequency  identification)  and  US.  Things  and  people  can  communicate  with  each  other  while 
supporting  remote  communication  between  people,  and  it  can  be  serviced  and  supplemented  the 
services of the IoT (Internet on Things) and M2M (Machine to Machine), WoT (Web-of-Things) that 
share them with services to be linked. In addition, mutual information networks have been composited 
due  to  network  convergence,  the  sense  of  privacy  and  cyber-attacks  on  RFID  and  sensor  network 
security is expected to surge in importance. There are different kinds of sensors, which we require for 
living.  Temperature,  humidity,  acceleration,  touch,  pressure,  vibration,  earthquake,  time,  location, 
coordinates, etc. are the physical sensors. Dust, chemical drugs, toxic gases such as chemical sensors  
blood,  bacteria,  fungi,  yeast,  DNA,  RNA  are  bio-sensors.  Cameras  and  microphones  are  video  and 
sound  sensors  to  detect  the  photocathode,  and  electric  power  and  electromagnetic  sensors  to  detect 
magnetic antenna and so on. In the future, long-term domestic and international markets, leading to 
global warming, green industries to support purification, as well as the resolution of food depletion, 
energy depletion, natural disasters, disaster and peaceful collaboration of the international community 
on  these  kinds  of  issues  that  require  business  followed  the  war,  terrorism,  drugs,  crime,  unethical 
accidents,  incidents  to  resolve  RFID,  USN,  bar  code,  QR  code  and  combined  RTLS,  GPS,  LBS 
location  services,  as  well  as  health,  nutrition,  hygiene,  environmental,  health,  In  this  paper,  several 
types of wireless network are configured and consist of an open wireless network which has a lot of 
issues that need to be addressed. Especially, the most important factors in wireless sensor network are

network  vulnerabilities,  and  interaction  between  the  different  systems,  such  as  security  and 
connectivity  issues. In this  paper,  based on the integration  of these  open  wireless  environments,  we 
analyzed requirement of network, problems, and for security needs [2, 3].

In the 21st century, advanced technologies have developed with fusion technology related to 
information  technology  and  another  fields  of  technology.  The  inherent  and  open  fundamental 
differences  among  the  various  open  network  related  to  wireless  networks,  integration  of  the 
security  schemes  of  those  networks  is  not  easy  job  to  be  solved.  To  integrate  several  open 
networks  related  to  wireless  networks  into  a  single  architecture,  there  are  a  number  of 
challenges  that  must  be  addressed.  The  main  topic  are  supporting  of  mobility  management, 
providing of quality of services and security interoperability.  Security requirement of  wireless 
communication  are  more  important  because  of  its  inherent  vulnerability.  The  security  and 
privacy issues and solutions for WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) are imperative. The lack of 
physical security combined with conventional operation make sensor node prone to a high risk 
of being captured and compromised. Jeong, et al, comparatively analyzed the unique network-
centric  features  and  security  mechanisms  of  various  heterogeneous  wireless  networks  that  are 
expected to be part of OWA (Open Wireless Network Architecture) and proposed an integrated 
security platform based on the security profile concept [4]. Bo sun, et al, introduced WSNs and 
RFID system and presented their security concerns and related solution. They focused on linear 
configuration  generator  based  on  lightweight  block  cipher  that  can  meet  security  co-existence 
requirements of WSNs and RFID system for pervasive computing [5].  
 
3. Basic Security Concepts 
 

To integrate several open wireless sensor network into single networks, a lot of consideration should 
be taken  into  account to solve  challenges that must  be  addresses.  These  matters include  support  for 
mobility management, quality of service provision, and security interoperability. An integrated security 
mechanism is one of the key challenges in open wireless network architecture because of the diversity 
of the networks in open wireless network architecture and the unique security mechanism used in each 
of the networks. Configuration of infrastructure of unification of wireless and wired system is shown in 
figure  1.  Therefore,  it  is  required  to  integrate  individual  communication  topology  and  each  security 
requirement. Recently, we are faced with a lot of change of communication because new technologies 
have  advanced.  Communication 
into  wireless  and  wire 
communication.  It  consists  of  individual  communication  topology.  But,  recently  the  topology  of 
communication is merged and united with wired and wireless part [6].  

topology  of  former  days  divided 

Security of wireless networks can be more easily compromised and may be vulnerable to a more 

diverse range of threats than wired networks. The generic security requirements are as follows. 

- Confidentiality 
- Authentication 
- Integrity 
- Availability 
- Non-repudiation 
  Security  technology  can  be  implemented  with  cryptographic  mechanism.  Cryptographic  is 
composed  of  two  processes,  encryption  and  decryption.  The  popular  techniques  are  private  key 
cryptosystem and public key cryptosystem. The representative factors are as follows. 

 
A. Fundamental security approaches 
- Multiple security mechanisms for source to destination security 
- Evolution from the notion of security mechanisms to the notion of security management                      
- Upper layer security approach 
- Multiple independent security processes

For  example,  to  realize  u-healthcare  system,  we  take  into  consideration  components  such  as 
confidentiality  by  authentication  and  encryption,  data  privacy,  confidentiality,  and  availability  by 
authorization, encrypted database and backup of database. The measures can be categorized into four 
security  layers  [7].  They  are  authentication  based  on  network,  authentication  based  on  application, 
database protection and user’s privacy. The example is shown in figure 2 and 3.

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is an automatic identification technology to remotely store 
and  retrieve  data.  A typical RFID  system  is  composed  of  RFID  tags,  RFID  readers  and  a  back-end 
server. Recently, the wide deployment of RFID systems in a variety of applications has raised many 
concerns about the privacy and the security. An RFID tag can be attached to a product, an animal, or a 
person  for  the  purpose  of  identification  using  radio  waves.  The  RFID  and  NFC  (Near  Far 
Communication)  technologies  bring  required  functions  for  developing  and  building  a  modern 
identification  system  for  decreasing  mistakes  in  healthcare.  Deploying  RFID  technology  in  the 
healthcare  industry  for  promoting  patient’s  data  and  records  in  hospital  is  a  complex  issue  since  it 
involves  technological,  economic,  social,  and  managerial  factors.  Hailong  Feng  and  Wenxiu  Fu 
proposed recent development about privacy and security of the IoT (Internet of things) and challenges 
and future trends of the IoT [12].

person  for  the  purpose  of  identification  using  radio  waves.  The  RFID  and  NFC  (Near  Far 
Communication)  technologies  bring  required  functions  for  developing  and  building  a  modern 
identification  system  for  decreasing  mistakes  in  healthcare.  Deploying  RFID  technology  in  the 
healthcare  industry  for  promoting  patient’s  data  and  records  in  hospital  is  a  complex  issue  since  it 
involves  technological,  economic,  social,  and  managerial  factors.  Hailong  Feng  and  Wenxiu  Fu 
proposed recent development about privacy and security of the IoT (Internet of things) and challenges 
and future trends of the IoT [12].

analysis,  spoofing,  disabling  the  service,  or  disclosing  sensitive  information  of  tags,  and  hence 
infringes  people’s  privacy  and  security.  Although  there  have  been  many  works    devoted  to  design 
security mechanisms  for low-cost RFIDs, most of these works require the tags to be equipped with 
costly  operations  such  as  one-way  hashing  functions,  which  are  still  unavailable  on  low-cost  tags 
because limited resources. Contrary to these works, schemes which are developed in recently do not 
require the support of hashing functions on tags. However, the schemes have been reported to show 
some  security  weaknesses.  Recently,  Lars  Kulseng  et  al.  [13],  proposed  a  lightweight  RFID 
authentication  protocol  for  low-cost  RFIDs  based  on  only  bitwise  XOR.  Different  from  most  of 
existing solutions which used conventional cryptographic primitives such as encryptions and hashing, 
theses protocols only used simple operations like XOR and substring [14]. Therefore, many attacks are 
occurred and the representative attacks are described in table 3.

Wei-Bin  proposed  a  cryptographic  key  management  solution  for  HIPAA  Privacy  and  security 
regulations  [16].  The  HIPPA  privacy  and  security  regulations  are  two  crucial  provisions  in  the 
protection  of healthcare  privacy.  Privacy  regulations create a principle to  assure  that patients have 
more  control  over  their  health  information  and  limits  on  the  usage  and  disclosure  of  health 
information.  The  security  regulations  give  a  guideline  the  provisions  which  are  implemented  to 
guard data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.  

5. Conclusion 

With the  development of  RFID  technology,  its  data security  and  personal  privacy  issues  become 
increasingly  prominent  becomes  an  obstacle  to  the  further  development  of  RFID  security  concern. 
Therefore, how to improve its security and protect personal privacy becomes a research focus. RFID 
technology has a number of advantages, but also opens a number of security problems that need to be 
addressed before its successful deployment. In this paper, we analyzed wireless sensor networks and 
RFID systems on real sensor hardware to apply optimized security issues. The security solution used in 
communication networks including wireless ad hoc and sensor networks are essential for privacy and 
security concerns related security issues.

An  integrated  security  mechanism  is  one  of  the  key  challenges  in  the  open  wireless  network 
architecture because of the diversity of the wireless network in open wireless network and the unique 
security mechanism used in each one of these networks. Optimized security protocols and mechanisms 
are necessary for the high performance and security concerns. Finally, a challenge and requirement of 
advanced security mechanism will meet the integration of open ubiquitous sensor network with security 
protocols  for  applying  their  applications  in  the  near  future.  We  analyzed  and  surveyed  features  of 
infrastructure and security mechanism of various heterogeneous wireless networks. 

Keywords: Security protocol, Wireless network architecture, Security requirement 

1. Introduction 
 

Recently, communication environment has been changed very much due to advances in information 
and  communication.  The  current  existing  information  networks  consist  of  the  wired  and  wireless 
network with a split network and the individual networks which can be developed. However, in recent 
years, wired and wireless network are integrated with two-step fusion of traditional wired and wireless 
networks. The network tends to integrate and fuse to set up total topology. With the characteristics of 
various types of wireless networks are advancing due to the needs of users’ demand for their network. 
Therefore, each network is developing with each their characteristics. From the user's perspective, the 
current existing network with integrated wireless communications based on the user-centric network 
architecture is developing new features and fusing with different networks. Depending on needs, the 
characteristics of wireless and mobile communication can be opened in order to realize the structure-
based wireless networks that have been developed using the form and needs [1]. 

The recent surge in cyber-attacks as a measure for the "fusion of security and privacy' has emerged 
as the hot-issue in these days. In particular, process of promoting the standards of ITU, such as the 
international organization for standardization in the NGN (Next Generation Network) technology and 
the  next  Internet,  web  technology  by  the  international  organization  for  standardization  fourth-
generation  mobile  communication  technology,  combined  with  the  standardization  of  RFID  (Radio 
Frequency  identification)  and  US.  Things  and  people  can  communicate  with  each  other  while 
supporting  remote  communication  between  people,  and  it  can  be  serviced  and  supplemented  the 
services of the IoT (Internet on Things) and M2M (Machine to Machine), WoT (Web-of-Things) that 
share them with services to be linked. In addition, mutual information networks have been composited 
due  to  network  convergence,  the  sense  of  privacy  and  cyber-attacks  on  RFID  and  sensor  network 
security is expected to surge in importance. There are different kinds of sensors, which we require for 
living.  Temperature,  humidity,  acceleration,  touch,  pressure,  vibration,  earthquake,  time,  location, 
coordinates, etc. are the physical sensors. Dust, chemical drugs, toxic gases such as chemical sensors  
blood,  bacteria,  fungi,  yeast,  DNA,  RNA  are  bio-sensors.  Cameras  and  microphones  are  video  and 
sound  sensors  to  detect  the  photocathode,  and  electric  power  and  electromagnetic  sensors  to  detect 
magnetic antenna and so on. In the future, long-term domestic and international markets, leading to 
global warming, green industries to support purification, as well as the resolution of food depletion, 
energy depletion, natural disasters, disaster and peaceful collaboration of the international community 
on  these  kinds  of  issues  that  require  business  followed  the  war,  terrorism,  drugs,  crime,  unethical 
accidents,  incidents  to  resolve  RFID,  USN,  bar  code,  QR  code  and  combined  RTLS,  GPS,  LBS 
location  services,  as  well  as  health,  nutrition,  hygiene,  environmental,  health,  In  this  paper,  several 
types of wireless network are configured and consist of an open wireless network which has a lot of 
issues that need to be addressed. Especially, the most important factors in wireless sensor network are

network  vulnerabilities,  and  interaction  between  the  different  systems,  such  as  security  and 
connectivity  issues. In this  paper,  based on the integration  of these  open  wireless  environments,  we 
analyzed requirement of network, problems, and for security needs [2, 3]. 

 

2. Related Work 

 

 

In the 21st century, advanced technologies have developed with fusion technology related to 
information  technology  and  another  fields  of  technology.  The  inherent  and  open  fundamental 
differences  among  the  various  open  network  related  to  wireless  networks,  integration  of  the 
security  schemes  of  those  networks  is  not  easy  job  to  be  solved.  To  integrate  several  open 
networks  related  to  wireless  networks  into  a  single  architecture,  there  are  a  number  of 
challenges  that  must  be  addressed.  The  main  topic  are  supporting  of  mobility  management, 
providing of quality of services and security interoperability.  Security requirement of  wireless 
communication  are  more  important  because  of  its  inherent  vulnerability.  The  security  and 
privacy issues and solutions for WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) are imperative. The lack of 
physical security combined with conventional operation make sensor node prone to a high risk 
of being captured and compromised. Jeong, et al, comparatively analyzed the unique network-
centric  features  and  security  mechanisms  of  various  heterogeneous  wireless  networks  that  are 
expected to be part of OWA (Open Wireless Network Architecture) and proposed an integrated 
security platform based on the security profile concept [4]. Bo sun, et al, introduced WSNs and 
RFID system and presented their security concerns and related solution. They focused on linear 
configuration  generator  based  on  lightweight  block  cipher  that  can  meet  security  co-existence 
requirements of WSNs and RFID system for pervasive computing [5].  
 
3. Basic Security Concepts 
 

To integrate several open wireless sensor network into single networks, a lot of consideration should 
be taken  into  account to solve  challenges that must  be  addresses.  These  matters include  support  for 
mobility management, quality of service provision, and security interoperability. An integrated security 
mechanism is one of the key challenges in open wireless network architecture because of the diversity 
of the networks in open wireless network architecture and the unique security mechanism used in each 
of the networks. Configuration of infrastructure of unification of wireless and wired system is shown in 
figure  1.  Therefore,  it  is  required  to  integrate  individual  communication  topology  and  each  security 
requirement. Recently, we are faced with a lot of change of communication because new technologies 
have  advanced.  Communication 
into  wireless  and  wire 
communication.  It  consists  of  individual  communication  topology.  But,  recently  the  topology  of 
communication is merged and united with wired and wireless part [6].  

topology  of  former  days  divided 

Security of wireless networks can be more easily compromised and may be vulnerable to a more 

diverse range of threats than wired networks. The generic security requirements are as follows. 

- Confidentiality 
- Authentication 
- Integrity 
- Availability 
- Non-repudiation 
  Security  technology  can  be  implemented  with  cryptographic  mechanism.  Cryptographic  is 
composed  of  two  processes,  encryption  and  decryption.  The  popular  techniques  are  private  key 
cryptosystem and public key cryptosystem. The representative factors are as follows. 

 
A. Fundamental security approaches 
- Multiple security mechanisms for source to destination security 
- Evolution from the notion of security mechanisms to the notion of security management                      
- Upper layer security approach 
- Multiple independent security processes

For  example,  to  realize  u-healthcare  system,  we  take  into  consideration  components  such  as 
confidentiality  by  authentication  and  encryption,  data  privacy,  confidentiality,  and  availability  by 
authorization, encrypted database and backup of database. The measures can be categorized into four 
security  layers  [7].  They  are  authentication  based  on  network,  authentication  based  on  application, 
database protection and user’s privacy. The example is shown in figure 2 and 3.

advances  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-mechanical  systems  (MEMS),  wireless  communication 
technologies and digital electronics. Sensor networks are composed of a large number of tiny devices 
or  sensors  which  monitor  their  surrounding  area  to  measure  environmental  information,  to  detect 
movements, vibrations [8]. We analyzed requirements to implement an architecture based on wireless 
part related to wireless networks with specialized features.

-  Optimization  of  individual  security  mechanism  under  different  security  level  under  heterogeneous 
network level and possibility of mathematical calculation with standard algorithm 
- Design of optimization of upper level to implement individual security level in transport layer 
- Design of independent mutual security authentication in heterogeneous device 
-  Analyses  of  group  key  management  and  protocol  to  utilize  different  security  mechanism  in  upper

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is an automatic identification technology to remotely store 
and  retrieve  data.  A typical RFID  system  is  composed  of  RFID  tags,  RFID  readers  and  a  back-end 
server. Recently, the wide deployment of RFID systems in a variety of applications has raised many 
concerns about the privacy and the security. An RFID tag can be attached to a product, an animal, or a 
person  for  the  purpose  of  identification  using  radio  waves.  The  RFID  and  NFC  (Near  Far
