I.  INTRODUCTION 

 The  significant  problems  in  the  present  society  are 
robbery,  crime  and  theft  that  increasing.  This  raises  the 
security  system  issue.  Basically,  almost  available  security 
systems  are  personal  monitoring  by  security  guards.  The 
disadvantages  of  these  systems  are  a  number  of  security 
guards to  serve  the  increasing  problems  and  low  efficiency 
due to unprofessional guards. Therefore, several of security 
types  have  studied,  applied  and  implemented  automatic 
systems  and  modern  technologies  to  secure  assets  against 
theft    RFID  (Radio  Frequency  Identification),  one  of  the 
promising technologies, that has been widely applied into the 
access  control  and  security  systems.  RFID  is  a  technology 
that helps to identify the animate or inanimate through radio 
waves  [1].  A  typical  RFID  system  consists  of  a  reader and 
transponder  [2].  RFID  is  a  leading  automatic  identification 
technology.    RFID  tags  communicate  information  by  radio 
wave through antennae on small computer chips attached to 
objects  so  that  such  objects  may  be  identified, located, and 
tracked [3]. 

Owing  to  the  RFID  technology  provides  the  security 
systems  significant  benefit  and  feasibility,  therefore,  this 
study applies the RFID technology into the security system in 
the car which is “Wireless Security Car using RFID System” 
in order to secure from car theft problem. Car is the important 
personal  property  of  most  people.  The  number  of  cars 
increases  with  the  increasing  number  of  the  peoples.  This 
project  is  a  safety  system  which  is  filled  with  features 
complete and this system will be process  without using any 
wired between the RFID reader and the RFID tag. The project 
is  specifically  designed  to  solve  a  car  theft,  especially  on 
luxury  cars.  RFID  is  used  to  car  security  system  which 
equipped  with  the  RFID  (Radio  Frequency  Identification), 
which function as key sensors which can activate the car by 
using radio frequency signals. It can also be said to acts as a 
key which only a  certain frequency can activate the car [4]. 

Another  security  and  privacy  of  the  RFID  technology  is 
authentication  and  access  control  which  is  applied  in  this 
project. Replacing keys with electronic cards or budges has a 
number of advantages. The primary one is that cards are more 
difficult  to  forge  and  can  be  revoked  more  easily  when 
compromised or lost than having to change the lock as is the 
case for mechanical keys [5].  

The principle of the system is when the passive RFID tag 
has placed near to the RFID reader, it will transmit the radio 
frequency to the RFID reader and RFID reader will read that 
signal and send to the PIC via serial communication. Then the 
PIC will control all the system inside car. The engine of car 
only can be start when tagging the passive RFID tag on the 
RFID reader. Without tagging the engine cannot be start and 
the  car  door  also  cannot  be  open.  Thus,  this  system  is  a 
several features which are quite difficult for intruders. 

II.  DESIGN CONSIDERATION 

The  Wireless  Security  Car  Using  RFID  System  operates 
following  the  figure  shown  in  Figure  1.  When  the  passive 
RFID tag is placed near to the RFID reader, the RDIF tag will 
receive the radio frequency via the antenna inside RFID tag. 
The radio frequency received will be converted into electrical 
power  that  is  enough  for  the  RFID  tag  to  transmit the  data 
back  to  the  RFID  reader.  Then,  the  RFID  reader  read  the 
RFID  tag.  Further  the  RFID reader  sends the  tag  ID  of  car 
owner 
the  PIC16F84A  microcontroller.  The  PIC 
microcontroller  process  the  tag  ID  such  the  user  name, 
password  and  so  on.  Then,  the  PIC  also  controls  the  car 
motor, alarm, and car lock.  For the car lock, PIC will control 
in order to unlock the switch central door automatically after 
tagging  the  RFID  tag  on  the  RFID  reader  and  also 
automatically lock after the user start the engine.  

to 

This project is designed to remind the user whenever the 
car door and the car bonnet improperly lock. By applies the 
RFID  technology  into  the  security  car,  it  can  avoid  from 
being invaded because this technology is very secure because 
the car engine only can start after tagging the Passive RFID 
tag on the RFID reader and without tagging, the car engine 
cannot  be  start.  This  situation  can  prevent  from  car  theft 
problem.

From  the  test  operating  the  wireless  security  car  using 
RFID  technology  including  system  parameters  variation,  it 
shows  that  performance,  efficiency  and  reliability  of  the 
system depend on the system physical parameters. Therefore, 
these  should  be  taken into account  to  develop  and  improve 
the high system efficiency. The following consideration lists 
the effects of the system parameters:  
Reading Range: As the effective reading distance is limited, 
initially  solved  this  limitation  by  using  horn  aperture.  This 
reflects and combines waves to increases enough in this use. 
However  this  consideration  is  an  interesting  issue  of 
extending the effective reading range including: The pattern 
of  wave  radiation  from  the  transmitting  end  at  the  reader 
should  be  explored.  Then  the  proper  reflecting  materials 

should provide high efficiency in wave radiation. The design 
of the antenna at the reader contributes the further the reading 
range. 
Percentage  of Tag  Reading  Accuracy: In the real system, 
the  accuracy  of  reader  should  be  100%  including  the  case 
several  tags  in  the  reading  range.  From  the  test  reading  is 
obtained only 80%.  
Position  and  Elevation  Angle  of  the  Reader:  At  the 
beginning,  the  system  is  operated  in  trial  and  error  for  the 
optimum angle of the reader. The radiation pattern should be 
explored and then this should support the optimum solution 
of the position and the elevation angle of the reader. 
Optimum Distance between Reader and Processing Unit: 
The  reader  position  is  located  at  the  proper  distance  of 
3meters, in the real situation, from the security box in which 
the processing and monitoring units is installed.  

Furthermore,  RFID  technology  in  UHF  band  has  some 
limitations  that  should  be  taken  into  account  in  designing 
system.  For  example,  the  radio  frequency  in  UHF  band 
cannot  propagate through  water and metal materials.  Based 
on the design of this hypothetical project, it is the system easy 
to handle and user friendly. RFID systems can be used on all 
types of cars. Therefore, the results of this project it became 
one  of  the  alternative  sources  of  sophistication  to  rival  the 
security  systems  have  been  available  in  the  market.  The 
“Wireless  Security  Car  Using  RFID  System”  is  a  modern 
inventory  security  car  system  because  RFID  technology  is 
now widely used especially as a replacement barcode in order 
to identify the physical object that the tag is attached.  

  RFID  also  offers  improvement  in  handling  inventory, 
security logistic and operations that are now being used. By 
adding the RFID technology into the security car system, the 
intruders are more difficult to steal the car because the RFID 
system  has  their  secrecy  and  privacy  which  is  it  is  very 
secured  because  it  cannot  access  to  the  data  means  only 
authorized  entities  such  as  people  or  system  can  read  and 
write  the  information.  The  mode  of  security  of  RFID

  This “Wireless Security Car Using RFID System” is suits 
the level of usage for individual or any organization in order 
to  increase  the  safety  of  their  car.  These  systems  there  are 
several  features  which  are  quite  difficult  to  be  encroached 
upon because by adding RFID technology it is more secure 
because  it  cannot  access  into  the  data  that  means  only 
authorized  entities  such  as  people  or  systems  can  read  and 
write the information.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

 The  significant  problems  in  the  present  society  are 
robbery,  crime  and  theft  that  increasing.  This  raises  the 
security  system  issue.  Basically,  almost  available  security 
systems  are  personal  monitoring  by  security  guards.  The 
disadvantages  of  these  systems  are  a  number  of  security 
guards to  serve  the  increasing  problems  and  low  efficiency 
due to unprofessional guards. Therefore, several of security 
types  have  studied,  applied  and  implemented  automatic 
systems  and  modern  technologies  to  secure  assets  against 
theft    RFID  (Radio  Frequency  Identification),  one  of  the 
promising technologies, that has been widely applied into the 
access  control  and  security  systems.  RFID  is  a  technology 
that helps to identify the animate or inanimate through radio 
waves  [1].  A  typical  RFID  system  consists  of  a  reader and 
transponder  [2].  RFID  is  a  leading  automatic  identification 
technology.    RFID  tags  communicate  information  by  radio 
wave through antennae on small computer chips attached to 
objects  so  that  such  objects  may  be  identified, located, and 
tracked [3]. 

Owing  to  the  RFID  technology  provides  the  security 
systems  significant  benefit  and  feasibility,  therefore,  this 
study applies the RFID technology into the security system in 
the car which is “Wireless Security Car using RFID System” 
in order to secure from car theft problem. Car is the important 
personal  property  of  most  people.  The  number  of  cars 
increases  with  the  increasing  number  of  the  peoples.  This 
project  is  a  safety  system  which  is  filled  with  features 
complete and this system will be process  without using any 
wired between the RFID reader and the RFID tag. The project 
is  specifically  designed  to  solve  a  car  theft,  especially  on 
luxury  cars.  RFID  is  used  to  car  security  system  which 
equipped  with  the  RFID  (Radio  Frequency  Identification), 
which function as key sensors which can activate the car by 
using radio frequency signals. It can also be said to acts as a 
key which only a  certain frequency can activate the car [4]. 

Another  security  and  privacy  of  the  RFID  technology  is 
authentication  and  access  control  which  is  applied  in  this 
project. Replacing keys with electronic cards or budges has a 
number of advantages. The primary one is that cards are more 
difficult  to  forge  and  can  be  revoked  more  easily  when 
compromised or lost than having to change the lock as is the 
case for mechanical keys [5].  

The principle of the system is when the passive RFID tag 
has placed near to the RFID reader, it will transmit the radio 
frequency to the RFID reader and RFID reader will read that 
signal and send to the PIC via serial communication. Then the 
PIC will control all the system inside car. The engine of car 
only can be start when tagging the passive RFID tag on the 
RFID reader. Without tagging the engine cannot be start and 
the  car  door  also  cannot  be  open.  Thus,  this  system  is  a 
several features which are quite difficult for intruders. 

II.  DESIGN CONSIDERATION 

The  Wireless  Security  Car  Using  RFID  System  operates 
following  the  figure  shown  in  Figure  1.  When  the  passive 
RFID tag is placed near to the RFID reader, the RDIF tag will 
receive the radio frequency via the antenna inside RFID tag. 
The radio frequency received will be converted into electrical 
power  that  is  enough  for  the  RFID  tag  to  transmit the  data 
back  to  the  RFID  reader.  Then,  the  RFID  reader  read  the 
RFID  tag.  Further  the  RFID reader  sends the  tag  ID  of  car 
owner 
the  PIC16F84A  microcontroller.  The  PIC 
microcontroller  process  the  tag  ID  such  the  user  name, 
password  and  so  on.  Then,  the  PIC  also  controls  the  car 
motor, alarm, and car lock.  For the car lock, PIC will control 
in order to unlock the switch central door automatically after 
tagging  the  RFID  tag  on  the  RFID  reader  and  also 
automatically lock after the user start the engine.  

to 

This project is designed to remind the user whenever the 
car door and the car bonnet improperly lock. By applies the 
RFID  technology  into  the  security  car,  it  can  avoid  from 
being invaded because this technology is very secure because 
the car engine only can start after tagging the Passive RFID 
tag on the RFID reader and without tagging, the car engine 
cannot  be  start.  This  situation  can  prevent  from  car  theft 
problem.

Other  that,  the  project  begins  by  programming  the 
microcontroller for serial communication with PIC 16F84A 
interface using EPIC software.PIC Kit Programmer also used 
for programming and debugging the PIC microcontroller in 
order to burn the programming into the PIC microcontroller 
using the burner and connected them to the supply. 

B.  The Component Details 

1.  RFID Reader  

-   The RFID reader is the most common and easy to 
use.  This  RFID  reader  use  DC12V-24V  power 
supply. The RFID Reader Module can be used in a 
wide  variety  of  hobbyist  and  commercial 
applications,  including  access  control,  automatic 
identification, 
inventory 
tracking, payment systems  

robotics,  navigation, 

2.  Passive  RFID  tag-Passive    tags    do    not    have    an  
internal  power  source  and  need  to  draw  power  
from  an  RFID interrogator. The interrogator emits 
electromagnetic  waves  that  induce  a  current  in  the 
tag's antenna and power the chip on the tag. When the 
power to the tag’s chip passes the minimum voltage 
threshold, the circuit turns on and the tag transmits its 
information to the reader. 

3.  PIC Microcontroller-PIC microcontroller is used to 
program for every each output such as the motor of 
window,  switch  of  car  door  and  the  ignition  part. 
Other  than  that  PIC  also  control  the  entire  security 
system  inside  the  car.  It  is  the main  brain,  where  it 
will  control  the  whole  of  system.  Train  system  will 
produce output according to what is programmed on 
the PIC. 

4.  ULN  2803-ULN 2803 is an integrated circuit which 
has 8 input pin and 8 output pin. This ULN comes in 
18 pin IC configuration and pin 9 is grounded. ULN 
2803 as an interface between the PIC microcontroller 
and relay and this ULN is used because to change the

components.  After  completion  developing  the  circuit,  then 
troubleshoot is made by testing the circuit in order to know 
the circuit is work or not. Next, develop a programming by 
using Basic Compiler Programming in order to program the 
system of RFID in this project. EPIC Software is used for PIC 
microcontroller and used notepad to write all process of this 
project  and  save  in  file  “.bas”  because  the  EPIC  Software 
only can read in this file.  

PIC Kit Programmer for programming and debugging the 
PIC microcontroller is used and the program must import into 
file  “.hex”  in  order  to  burn  the  programming  into  the  PIC 
microcontroller using the burner and connected them to the 
supply. After programming, do a troubleshoot once again in 
order to check the system is work properly or not and if any 
error  occurred,  the  programming is  developed  again until it 
successful. Then, Hardware and Software Integration, means 
combine  them  together.  After  that,  do  troubleshoot  and 
experimental analysis which is the final step before it can be 
presented.  Lastly,  the  final  result  of  project  is  successfully 
worked without facing any error. 

III.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 

The  security  system  in  this  study  is  implemented  and 
tested in the environment that are simulated the real operating 
area.  This  regarding  parameters  are  defined  during  the 
installing  and  testing  procedures  for  the  optimal  conditions 
relating the real operating situation. The result of the test by 
condition  the  environmental  parameters  at  the  beginning 
stage  are  included  in  the  table  1.  There are  five  parameters 
including:  reading  range,  accuracy  of  tag  reading  in 
percentage,  position  of  the  reader,  elevation  of  the  reader, 
processing  time  and  optimum  distance  between  the  reader 
and the processing unit.

From  the  test  operating  the  wireless  security  car  using 
RFID  technology  including  system  parameters  variation,  it 
shows  that  performance,  efficiency  and  reliability  of  the 
system depend on the system physical parameters. Therefore, 
these  should  be  taken into account  to  develop  and  improve 
the high system efficiency. The following consideration lists 
the effects of the system parameters:  
Reading Range: As the effective reading distance is limited, 
initially  solved  this  limitation  by  using  horn  aperture.  This 
reflects and combines waves to increases enough in this use. 
However  this  consideration  is  an  interesting  issue  of 
extending the effective reading range including: The pattern 
of  wave  radiation  from  the  transmitting  end  at  the  reader 
should  be  explored.  Then  the  proper  reflecting  materials 

should provide high efficiency in wave radiation. The design 
of the antenna at the reader contributes the further the reading 
range. 
Percentage  of Tag  Reading  Accuracy: In the real system, 
the  accuracy  of  reader  should  be  100%  including  the  case 
several  tags  in  the  reading  range.  From  the  test  reading  is 
obtained only 80%.  
Position  and  Elevation  Angle  of  the  Reader:  At  the 
beginning,  the  system  is  operated  in  trial  and  error  for  the 
optimum angle of the reader. The radiation pattern should be 
explored and then this should support the optimum solution 
of the position and the elevation angle of the reader. 
Optimum Distance between Reader and Processing Unit: 
The  reader  position  is  located  at  the  proper  distance  of 
3meters, in the real situation, from the security box in which 
the processing and monitoring units is installed.  

Furthermore,  RFID  technology  in  UHF  band  has  some 
limitations  that  should  be  taken  into  account  in  designing 
system.  For  example,  the  radio  frequency  in  UHF  band 
cannot  propagate through  water and metal materials.  Based 
on the design of this hypothetical project, it is the system easy 
to handle and user friendly. RFID systems can be used on all 
types of cars. Therefore, the results of this project it became 
one  of  the  alternative  sources  of  sophistication  to  rival  the 
security  systems  have  been  available  in  the  market.  The

results  of  planning, 
implementation  and  results  of  a 
systematic  discussion  to  design  and  produce  the  project 
"Using  RFID  Wireless  Car  Security  System"  was 
successfully implemented. In conclusion, the user "Wireless 
Car  Security  System  Using  RFID"  clearly 
shows 
improvements  in  the  use  and  effectiveness  as  it  is  more 
systematic  and  effective  than  the  existing  security  system. 
This is due to "Wireless Car Security System Using FRID." 

To solve the crime problem that is rampant car theft as a 
result of a security system is not complete. Humans should be 
protected  to  make  life  in  a  state  safe  and  avoid  the  threat. 
Recognizing  inherent  privacy  or  security  threats  of  RFID 
systems  will  be  also  helpful  for  decision-making  regarding 
the obligations of RFID manufacturers and the privacy rights 
of  end  users.  The  “Wireless  Security  Car  Using  RFID 
System”  in  this  study  evaluates  the  possibility  of  applying 
RFID technology into securing program against asset theft 

In  order  to  obtain  the  higher  performance  of  the  system, 
some  suggestions  are  included here as  a  guide  and  plan  for 
further developing the system. To apply this project into the 
car  need  to  use  own  external  wiring  without  disturbing  the 
wiring that already fix in the car. So, maybe it can give extra 
work and more expenses to the customer because need to do 
extra  wiring.  So,  that  it  need  to  do  more  research  how  to 
apply this project direct to the wiring that already been in the 
car. In addition, one of limitations of RFID with UHF band is 
that  the  RF  cannot  propagate  through  water  and  metal 
materials.  The  solution  of  this limitation  is  using  the  RF  in 
MF band (13.56MHz) that is better than the UHF in travelling 
through such the mentioned media.
