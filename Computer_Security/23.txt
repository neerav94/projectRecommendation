according to the command sent in the SMS. The switching module is controlled 
by the microcontroller. The switching module is be in the form of a relay which 
allows a low power circuit to switch a relatively high current on or off for example 
a bulb connected to the 220V mains supply. The switching process is done by 
the relay in the project. 
 

2.3 Module Designing 
 
The framework of the proposed system is shown in Figure 2.

Serial I/O is considered as options for connection between the GSM module and the 
microcontroller.  Using  the  microcontroller,  a  control  circuit  will  be  implemented  to 
control  the  electrical  appliances.  The  GSM  module  has  been  attached  with  the 
microcontroller and for this purpose a communication protocol has to be implemented. 
Pursuing this RS-232 parallel communication protocol has been  brought up here to 
secure the communication issue. The GSM module is equipped with a SIM (Subscriber 
identity  module)  and  this  SIM  maintains  the  complete  communication  with  the  user 
and  the  system.  RS-232  circuit  is  mainly  voltage  level  converter.  In  our  project, 
microcontroller voltage level is 5V and GSM module voltage level is 3.6V. Here we 
use  SIM300  GSM  module  demo  board.  This  demo  board  is  actually  design  for 
communicate with computer. So voltage level of this communication environment is 
around 7.5V. With this voltage level command the relays are controlled and with the 
peripherals we can secure the fire alarm and the PIR sensor. Below diagram describes 
the working topology for the RS-232 communication module units. The voltage level 
transition using the RS-232 is the key to this work. If this voltage level transition is not 
been made then the appliance control would be a tough challenge. The block diagram 
of RS-232 voltage conversion is shown in Figure.3 for the better justification of the 
RS-232 communication protocol and device utilization.

control  the  electrical  appliances.  The  GSM  module  has  been  attached  with  the

The  process  works  in  the  fully  automated  way. When  the  users  want  to  reach  any 
home appliances he/she has to just send a SMS to the desired mobile number in the 
GSM module. The RS-232 port will the digital message turns in to analog voltage level 
signal  and  with  this  voltage  level  the  relays  are  being  terminated  and  the  home 
appliances can be turned on and off. This could be one of the very easiest way. 
 
The  very  basic  difference  between  with  the  other  model  is  that  the  whole  system 
doesn’t need any internet connection so in a remote condition  it can be used. Another 
most significant specification of  the developed system  is  the  security  control  of  the 
household and  the  fire  protection service. The  device is  not that much big in size so 
it can be placed in any place and the usage is ease of access. A photograph of the 
developed system is shown in Figure.4.

3. Prototype Verifications and Results 
 
The prototype we had designed and verification for that we had connected some lights 
and  other  appliances  with  the  module  so  we  can  test  the  whole  system. With  our 
illustration we can manual switch mode on and off the devices and also get to know 
the power status of the each device.

In  this  paper,  we  demonstrate  the  design  and  development  of  a  simple  secure and 
robust automated home automation and security system using microcontroller with a 
high efficiency. The developed system is verified through experiments. 
 
2. System Design 
 
The design methodology and specification of the components are described below: 
 
2.1 Design Methodology 
 
This whole system is constitutes of basically two sub divisions. The hardware part and 
the  software  synchronization.  The  hardware  part  consist  of  AVR  ATmega8L 
microcontroller enabled system and including that the GSM module has been attached 
with  the  RS-232  communication protocol.  The  appliances,  smoke  detector  and PIR 
sensor linked with the relays. The relays are the output portals of the microcontroller. 
With  the  relays  the  whole  system  accomplishes the  desired  task  as  the  commands 
come and goes. GSM module plays a very crucial role in the whole project. The system 
has been made completely autonomous and for this autonomous purpose the GSM 
module plays all the operational purpose. The system block diagram shown in Figure 
1 illustrates the basic understanding of the whole system methodology.

2.2 System Specifications 
 
The key sub-systems of our developed system is as follows: 
 

 

  User  GSM  mobile  Handset:  Cellular  phone  containing  SIM  (Subscriber’s 
Identifying Module) card has a specific number through which communication 
takes place. The mode of communication is wireless and mechanism works on 
the GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) Technology. Here, the user 
transmits instructions to the system to control the appliance in the form of SMS. 
 

  Receiver GSM module: It is a hardware component that allows the capability 
to send and receive SMS to and from the system. The communication with 
the system takes place via RS232 serial port. Cell phone can be attached at 
the  place  of  GSM  hardware  but  it  limits  the  hardware  functionality  such  as 
sending or receiving of SMS. 

 

  Microcontroller  embedded  module:  The  module  contains  the  micro-controller 
(AT89C51) and a timeout generator circuit. This is the main part of the system. 
On  receipt  of  the  SMS  message,  text  words are checked with predetermined 
format which includes desired device ON/OFF commands. To read a message 
81 

 

Asad, Muzahid & Faruk 

the  microcontroller sends  the  appropriate AT  command to the  Receiver GSM 
module which works as a GSM modem. 
 

  Switching M o d u l e :  This m o d u l e  d r i v e s   ( switches ON/OFF) the  appliance 
according to the command sent in the SMS. The switching module is controlled 
by the microcontroller. The switching module is be in the form of a relay which 
allows a low power circuit to switch a relatively high current on or off for example 
a bulb connected to the 220V mains supply. The switching process is done by 
the relay in the project. 
 

2.3 Module Designing 
 
The framework of the proposed system is shown in Figure 2.

Serial I/O is considered as options for connection between the GSM module and the 
microcontroller.  Using  the  microcontroller,  a  control  circuit  will  be  implemented  to 
control  the  electrical  appliances.  The  GSM  module  has  been  attached  with  the 
microcontroller and for this purpose a communication protocol has to be implemented. 
Pursuing this RS-232 parallel communication protocol has been  brought up here to 
secure the communication issue. The GSM module is equipped with a SIM (Subscriber 
identity  module)  and  this  SIM  maintains  the  complete  communication  with  the  user 
and  the  system.  RS-232  circuit  is  mainly  voltage  level  converter.  In  our  project, 
microcontroller voltage level is 5V and GSM module voltage level is 3.6V. Here we 
use  SIM300  GSM  module  demo  board.  This  demo  board  is  actually  design  for 
communicate with computer. So voltage level of this communication environment is 
around 7.5V. With this voltage level command the relays are controlled and with the 
peripherals we can secure the fire alarm and the PIR sensor. Below diagram describes 
the working topology for the RS-232 communication module units. The voltage level 
transition using the RS-232 is the key to this work. If this voltage level transition is not 
been made then the appliance control would be a tough challenge. The block diagram 
of RS-232 voltage conversion is shown in Figure.3 for the better justification of the 
RS-232 communication protocol and device utilization.

The  process  works  in  the  fully  automated  way. When  the  users  want  to  reach  any 
home appliances he/she has to just send a SMS to the desired mobile number in the 
GSM module. The RS-232 port will the digital message turns in to analog voltage level 
signal  and  with  this  voltage  level  the  relays  are  being  terminated  and  the  home 
appliances can be turned on and off. This could be one of the very easiest way. 
 
The  very  basic  difference  between  with  the  other  model  is  that  the  whole  system 
doesn’t need any internet connection so in a remote condition  it can be used. Another 
most significant specification of  the developed system  is  the  security  control  of  the 
household and  the  fire  protection service. The  device is  not that much big in size so 
it can be placed in any place and the usage is ease of access. A photograph of the 
developed system is shown in Figure.4.

3. Prototype Verifications and Results 
 
The prototype we had designed and verification for that we had connected some lights 
and  other  appliances  with  the  module  so  we  can  test  the  whole  system. With  our 
illustration we can manual switch mode on and off the devices and also get to know 
the power status of the each device.

According  to  the  given  snapshots as  shown  in  Figure  5,  the  appliances  are  being 
switched  on and off. Not only switching  the status check procedure has also been 
made. The whole process just made with the sending SMS and receiving  SMS. The 
loads are usually  the devices  which  are  connected  with  the  relay,  As shown in the 
prototype illustration photo  after  sending the status check  command  the from  the 
GSM  module  we  are  getting  back  the  reply  command  as  it  was  made  set  in  the 
microcontroller. After  the  status  checking  the  user  can  also control  the  loads  only 
using the user mobile. The SMS were sent and the commands were fetch from RS-
232  port  in  the  embedded  system  and how  this  whole  system  module  are  being 
organized. 
 
Rather than the home appliances on the relay sensor were connected and the smoke 
detector. These are used as the home security system. The PIR sensor acknowledge 
any unauthorized entry in the residence and notify the user’s about it. In case of fire 
alarm system the smoke detector has been deployed. 
 
For the motion sensor sensed any motion  then it  would send below the  SMS  from 
set-up  of  GSM  module  to  our  mobile  handset  and  this  SMS  send  to  our  mobile 
handset afterward 1 minute left and continuities as shown in Figure 6.

1. Introduction 
 
The enhancement of mobile communication technology has led us to a certain level 
of progression in our daily life. Working with this concept motivated us to bring up a 
new and fresh concept of controlling the home appliances and the security surveillance 
system  with  the  GSM  and  GPRS  technology.  The  whole  system  is  based  on  the 
embedded  engineering  and  microcontroller 
this  module.  A 
microcontroller module has been designed with a GSM module for the SMS up and 
down stream. 
 
The home appliances are being connected with the relays and through this relays the 
home appliances are being  controlled.  For  the  surveillance  method  smoke  detector 
and PIR sensor has been used to make the notification process for the user part. This 
proposed solution will be simple and secure with robustness. 
 
For  home  automation  several  approach  has  been  investigated  so  far.  A  remote 
household appliance control has been elaborated in using internet (Alkar 2005; Jacobs 
1963;  Nunes  2000;  Sriskanthan  2002;  Liang  2002).  A  Bluetooth  based  home 
automation control is described by few researchers (Jia-Ching Wang 2008). A GSM 
based  system  for  home  automation  is  described  which  uses  voice  commands  for 
control  (Yuksekkaya  2006).  Voice  commands  for  home  automation  are  being 
described in some research paper (Rifat Shahriyar 2008). For the simplicity and low 
cost we choose to use microcontroller and GSM module to the task.

Md. Abdullah Al Asad*, Md. Al Muzahid** and Md. S. Faruk*** 

 

 

The rapid change in the wireless communication service and technology has made it 
possible  to  decrease  the  cost  for  communication  and  also  to  incorporate  this 
technology  with  our  daily  life.  Based  on  SMS/GPRS  mobile  device  and  embedded 
module including the self-organized home automation system,  i t   can  be  integrated 
to  allow  the  user  end  to  control  the home appliances and devices and to monitor the 
home surveillance system. In this paper a new concept  of using a  small  mobile  phone 
as  a  handy device for user to control any home autonomous system is demonstrated. 
A communication module with a microcontroller  enabled  system  in  sync  with  the  cell 
phone  to send commands and receive alerts through the complete system was used. 
The  system  for  home  surveillance  arrangement  and  merged the fire  smoke  detector 
with  the  whole  microcontroller  module  including  the  SMS  sending  and  receiving 
process is designed.

1. Introduction 
 
The enhancement of mobile communication technology has led us to a certain level 
of progression in our daily life. Working with this concept motivated us to bring up a 
new and fresh concept of controlling the home appliances and the security surveillance 
system  with  the  GSM  and  GPRS  technology.  The  whole  system  is  based  on  the 
embedded  engineering  and  microcontroller 
this  module.  A 
microcontroller module has been designed with a GSM module for the SMS up and 
down stream. 
 
The home appliances are being connected with the relays and through this relays the 
home appliances are being  controlled.  For  the  surveillance  method  smoke  detector 
and PIR sensor has been used to make the notification process for the user part. This 
proposed solution will be simple and secure with robustness. 
 
For  home  automation  several  approach  has  been  investigated  so  far.  A  remote 
household appliance control has been elaborated in using internet (Alkar 2005; Jacobs 
1963;  Nunes  2000;  Sriskanthan  2002;  Liang  2002).  A  Bluetooth  based  home 
automation control is described by few researchers (Jia-Ching Wang 2008). A GSM 
based  system  for  home  automation  is  described  which  uses  voice  commands  for 
control  (Yuksekkaya  2006).  Voice  commands  for  home  automation  are  being 
described in some research paper (Rifat Shahriyar 2008). For the simplicity and low 
cost we choose to use microcontroller and GSM module to the task.

In  this  paper,  we  demonstrate  the  design  and  development  of  a  simple  secure and 
robust automated home automation and security system using microcontroller with a 
high efficiency. The developed system is verified through experiments. 
 
2. System Design 
 
The design methodology and specification of the components are described below: 
 
2.1 Design Methodology 
 
This whole system is constitutes of basically two sub divisions. The hardware part and 
the  software  synchronization.  The  hardware  part  consist  of  AVR  ATmega8L 
microcontroller enabled system and including that the GSM module has been attached 
with  the  RS-232  communication protocol.  The  appliances,  smoke  detector  and PIR 
sensor linked with the relays. The relays are the output portals of the microcontroller. 
With  the  relays  the  whole  system  accomplishes the  desired  task  as  the  commands 
come and goes. GSM module plays a very crucial role in the whole project. The system 
has been made completely autonomous and for this autonomous purpose the GSM 
module plays all the operational purpose. The system block diagram shown in Figure 
1 illustrates the basic understanding of the whole system methodology. 
 

Figure 1: System Methodology Diagram 

 

 
2.2 System Specifications 
 
The key sub-systems of our developed system is as follows: 
 

 

  User  GSM  mobile  Handset:  Cellular  phone  containing  SIM  (Subscriber’s 
Identifying Module) card has a specific number through which communication 
takes place. The mode of communication is wireless and mechanism works on 
the GSM (Global System for Mobile communication) Technology. Here, the user 
transmits instructions to the system to control the appliance in the form of SMS. 
 

  Receiver GSM module: It is a hardware component that allows the capability 
to send and receive SMS to and from the system. The communication with 
the system takes place via RS232 serial port. Cell phone can be attached at 
the  place  of  GSM  hardware  but  it  limits  the  hardware  functionality  such  as 
sending or receiving of SMS. 

 

  Microcontroller  embedded  module:  The  module  contains  the  micro-controller 
(AT89C51) and a timeout generator circuit. This is the main part of the system. 
On  receipt  of  the  SMS  message,  text  words are checked with predetermined 
format which includes desired device ON/OFF commands. To read a message 
81 

 

Asad, Muzahid & Faruk 

the  microcontroller sends  the  appropriate AT  command to the  Receiver GSM 
module which works as a GSM modem. 
 

  Switching M o d u l e :  This m o d u l e  d r i v e s   ( switches ON/OFF) the  appliance 
according to the command sent in the SMS. The switching module is controlled 
by the microcontroller. The switching module is be in the form of a relay which 
allows a low power circuit to switch a relatively high current on or off for example 
a bulb connected to the 220V mains supply. The switching process is done by 
the relay in the project. 
 

2.3 Module Designing 
 
The framework of the proposed system is shown in Figure 2. 

 

Figure 2: System Framework 

 

 

 
Serial I/O is considered as options for connection between the GSM module and the 
microcontroller.  Using  the  microcontroller,  a  control  circuit  will  be  implemented  to 
control  the  electrical  appliances.  The  GSM  module  has  been  attached  with  the 
microcontroller and for this purpose a communication protocol has to be implemented. 
Pursuing this RS-232 parallel communication protocol has been  brought up here to 
secure the communication issue. The GSM module is equipped with a SIM (Subscriber 
identity  module)  and  this  SIM  maintains  the  complete  communication  with  the  user 
and  the  system.  RS-232  circuit  is  mainly  voltage  level  converter.  In  our  project, 
microcontroller voltage level is 5V and GSM module voltage level is 3.6V. Here we 
use  SIM300  GSM  module  demo  board.  This  demo  board  is  actually  design  for 
communicate with computer. So voltage level of this communication environment is 
around 7.5V. With this voltage level command the relays are controlled and with the 
peripherals we can secure the fire alarm and the PIR sensor. Below diagram describes 
the working topology for the RS-232 communication module units. The voltage level 
transition using the RS-232 is the key to this work. If this voltage level transition is not 
been made then the appliance control would be a tough challenge. The block diagram 
of RS-232 voltage conversion is shown in Figure.3 for the better justification of the 
RS-232 communication protocol and device utilization.

Figure.3: RS-232 Framework 

 

 

 
The  process  works  in  the  fully  automated  way. When  the  users  want  to  reach  any 
home appliances he/she has to just send a SMS to the desired mobile number in the 
GSM module. The RS-232 port will the digital message turns in to analog voltage level 
signal  and  with  this  voltage  level  the  relays  are  being  terminated  and  the  home 
appliances can be turned on and off. This could be one of the very easiest way. 
 
The  very  basic  difference  between  with  the  other  model  is  that  the  whole  system 
doesn’t need any internet connection so in a remote condition  it can be used. Another 
most significant specification of  the developed system  is  the  security  control  of  the 
household and  the  fire  protection service. The  device is  not that much big in size so 
it can be placed in any place and the usage is ease of access. A photograph of the 
developed system is shown in Figure.4.

3. Prototype Verifications and Results 
 
The prototype we had designed and verification for that we had connected some lights 
and  other  appliances  with  the  module  so  we  can  test  the  whole  system. With  our 
illustration we can manual switch mode on and off the devices and also get to know 
the power status of the each device.

detector. These are used as the home security system. The PIR sensor acknowledge 
any unauthorized entry in the residence and notify the user’s about it. In case of fire 
alarm system the smoke detector has been deployed. 
 
For the motion sensor sensed any motion  then it  would send below the  SMS  from 
set-up  of  GSM  module  to  our  mobile  handset  and  this  SMS  send  to  our  mobile 
handset afterward 1 minute left and continuities as shown in Figure 6.
