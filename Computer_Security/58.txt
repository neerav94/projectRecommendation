Abstract— Radio frequency identification, or RFID, is an emerging technology that wirelessly transmits an identification number from a  small 
inexpensive device,  called  a  tag, to  devices,  called readers,  capable  of  communicating  with the tag. The  technology  enables  a  single  reader to 
inventory hundreds of tagged items per second, wirelessly and without line-of-sight; tags can remain in enclosures or packaging materials. This 
paper surveys the various areas where RFID has been implemented in various countries & proposes a system which can be used / implemented 
by Banks, for various security measures. The CCTV cameras which are used in the banks, for the security purposes do not prove much efficient 
to  stop  forgery,  or  robbery.  There  are some  recent  cases  in  India where  some  internal  officer  made  duplicate locker  keys  and  then used  it  for 
robbery, it came to notice only when these lockers were opened. The concept of this proposal is RFID embedded locker keys. These keys can be 
used along with personal identification of the locker holder like figure print or eye retina scan etc. The officers who enter the locker room their 
RFID enabled strong room keys also will be attached to their biometric authentication, so the system can restrict and buzz an alarm when anyone 
without authentication tries to enter.  Also this  could  help to track the list  of  officers  for investigation in  case  of  robber y.  The time and  date  of 
entry and exit can also be noted. Applied properly this system will help to improve the security of the Banks.

 INTRODUCTION  

Almost  in  all  the  nationalized  banks  in  India;  lockers  are 
provided to the customers where they can keep their valuables. 
These lockers work on two keys; one key is with customer and 
the  other is master key  of  the lockers  which  is  with  the  bank. 
The  ‘Strong  Room’  lock  also  needs  two  keys,  which  are  with 
Head cashier and Branch manager. There are some recent cases 
in India where some internal officer made duplicate locker keys 
and then used it for robbery, it came to notice only when these 
lockers were opened. In some of the robbery cases the robbers 
dig  a  tunnel  and  cut  the  lockers  /  ATM  machine.    These  all 
cases points’ to the following loop holes in the present system. 

  Almost  all  banks  have  manual  authentication  of 
customers.    Yet,  non  authorized  family  members  can 
be  allowed  (if  it  suits  to  the  conscious  of  the  bank 
officer). 

  The  Bank  officers  can  easily  duplicate  the  keys  for 

future misuse.  
If the keys are stolen the whole lockers are insecure.  

 
  No security of lockers/ ATM is assured if robbers cut 

them. 

This  paper  focuses  on  how  to  enhance  security  of  Strong 
Room,  Customer  Lockers  and  ATM  using  Radio-frequency 
identification 
technology  along  with  Biometric 
authentication techniques. This paper proposes a system design 
for this add on security to the bank lockers, strong room.

RFID 

An  RFID 

system  can  be  considered  a  wireless 
communication system since the reader communicates with the 
tags by using electromagnetic waves at radio frequencies. RFID 
systems  can  be  categorized  as  active  and  passive  systems  [3]. 
In an active  system,  the tag  (i.e.  active  RFID tag) has  its  own 
power  source,  which  is  a  battery,  enclosed  in  the  transponder 
housing. In passive system, the tag does not have its own power 
source; instead, it draws power from the reader’s radio signals. 
Passive tags are inexpensive compared to active tags [3]. Every 
RFID  label  carries  a  globally  unique  read  only  serial  number 

defined  at  manufacture.  In  addition,  there  is  a  user  definable 
read–write  memory  of  between  64  bits  and  2  kbits  [4].  RFID 
operates  in  several  different  radio  bands:  0–135  kHz,  13.56 
MHz, 433 MHz, 900 MHz, and 2.4 GHz (microwaves) etc. [4].  

A typical RFID system consists of three components:  
1) An electronic data carrying device, called a transponder   
     or tag; 
2) Antennas and readers that facilitate tag interrogation; and 
3)  Software,  called  middleware,  that  controls  the  RFID 
equipment, manages the RFID data, and distributes information 
to  other  remote  data-processing  systems  by  interfacing  with 
enterprise applications [3]. 

The  major  advantages  of  passive  RFID  tags  are  it  is  cost 
effective  and  smaller  in  size.  Due  to  above  advantages,  it  is 
widely  use  by  inventory  tracking  technology  [3,  4].  Current 
antenna technology makes it possible for smaller size tags [5].   
 

II.  RELATED WORKS  

RFID  has  been  widely  used  for  security  enhancing, 

following are some major works done in this area. 

1.  First work is a door locking system using passive type of 
RFID  tag.  This  system  can  activate,  authenticate,  and 
validate  the  user  and  unlock  the  door  in  real  time  for 
secure  access  [1].  A  centralized  system  manages  the 
controlling,  transaction  and  operation  task.  The  door 
locking  system  functions  in  real  time  as  the  door  open 
quickly when user put their tag in contact of reader. The 
system also creates a log containing check-in and check-
out of each user along with basic information of user [1]. 
The  major  weakness  in  this  system  is  the  door  thickness 
request: 32mm ~ 45mm [1]; which is too small for bank locker 
and Strong rooms’ doors. In most of the banks the door size is 
of 6-10 inches and these are very heavy with multiple layers of 
steel sheets. Second drawback is it uses only one RFID card to 
open the door [1]; where as in the bank’s the double security is 
must.

2.  Second  work  has  implemented  a  bank  locker  security 
system  based  on  RFID  and  GSM  technology.  This 
contains  door  locking  system  using  RFID  and  GSM 
which  can  activate,  authenticate,  and  validate  the  user 
and unlock the door  in real time  for  bank locker  secure 
access  [2].  In  this  system  the  RFID  reader  reads  the  id

authenticated  person  mobile  number,  for  the  original 
password to open the bank locker. If the person send the 
password  to  the  microcontroller,  which  will  verify  the 
passwords  entered  by  the  key  board  and  received  from 
authenticated mobile  phone and if  these two  passwords 
are  matched  the locker  will  be  opened  otherwise it  will 
be remain in locked position [2].

request 

It is not practically possible to implement this system due to 

following reasons –  

a) If there are no mobile towers, or the tower signals are too 
weak  then  system  fails.  (In  India  many  remote  areas 
don’t have mobile towers.) 

b) Sending the password over mobiles has its own hacking 

ricks involved.  

c)  Delay  in  the  message  sending  and  receiving  can  occur 

and even messages can be hacked.  

 

3. Some  other  security  works  are  on  the  security  of 
shopping  malls,  as  CCTV  doesn’t  provide  much  aid  to 
stop  the  shop-lifters  from  stealing items  in the  shop. In 
those  systems  a  passive  RFID  tag  is  attached  to  each 
item  in  the  shop  and  if  these  items  are  taken  out  of 
shop/mall  without  bill  payment  it  triggers  an  alarm  
warning  of  the  shoplifting  [11,12].  The  security  of  the 
cash section can also be achieved by RFID identity cards 
(ID) of the employees [12]. These RFID ID card restricts 
entry  of  the  employees  in  secured zone  where  cash and 
other documents are to be kept [12].  

But these systems are also insufficient for bank locker security. 

 

III.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

In  this  paper  we  propose  a  system  for  the  security  of 
‘Customer  lockers’,  ‘Strong  Rooms’  in  banks  and  ATM.  This 
system will have the RFID tagged Key for each locker, Digital 
Lock for the door of the Locker Room/Strong Room, Biometric 
Authentication  Devices,  Light  Sensor  Device  for  each  locker 
and  a  Database  which  will  store  all  the  related  information 
about the lockers as shown below.  

 
RFID Tagged Key 
 
Each  locker  holder  customer  will  have  only  one  physical 
key  with  the  RFID  tag  attached  to  it,  though  some  key  chain 
like mechanism.  As the  RFID  tag has a  unique number hence 
duplication  of  the  keys  will  not  be  possible.  The  RFID  tag 
number entry will be done along with the Bank Locker number. 
Note  the  locker  key  allocated  will  be  only  one.  We  propose 
passive  RFID  tags  which  are  much  cheaper  as  compared  to 
active tags. These are also smaller in size as compared to active 
tags  [3].  In  the  cases  when  a  customer  loosed  an  RFID  key, 
different  key  can  be  given  with  new  RFID  tag  after  proper 
verification  and  previous  will  be  deactivated  from  banking 
database.  

 

 

 
 
Figure 1: Proposed design of the system 

BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION DEVICE 

 

This  can  be  either  eye  retina  scan  or  the  finger  print  scan 
device.  Generally  owner  of  the  bank  locker  nominates  two 
persons, who can operate the locker. Usually one is the family 
member and other is the customer himself/herself. Hence, it is 
needed  to  store  the  biometric  authentication  of  both  the 
operators of a particular customer locker. In State Bank of India 
and  some  other  Banks  figure  print  authentication  devices  for 
the  bank  employees  are  already  installed  which  are  basically 
used  as  a  protection  to  access  banking  software.  Hence  for 
Indian Banks it can be extended for customer identification; as 
proposed in this paper.   

DATA BASE 

The Database will contain the detail information about each 
locker  like  the  name  of  the  customer,  mobile  number,  locker 
number,  RFID  tag  number  and  details  about  biometric 
authentication  of  the  locker  operators  like  figure  print  or  eye 
retina scan data along with their names. The Database will also 
have the Log Reports every time the locker is opened. This log 
may contain the name of the person who operated locker, date, 
time and duration for which the locker was open. 

DIGITAL LOCK 

We  don’t  promote  the  system  for  automatic  door  opening; 
rather  it  opens  a  simple  digital  lock  on  the  door  of  the  locker 
room.  Once  this  digital  lock  is  opened,  then  the  door  can  be 
opened manually. Looking at the developing countries and the 
problem  of  the  power  cut  (Electricity  shortage  problem),  it  is 
more  feasible to  open  digital lock than  to  open the door; as  it 
will  need  lesser  electrical  power  and  will  also  work  on 
generators  or  batteries.  This  means  the  door  of  the  customers 
locker room will have the ‘Traditional  Locks’ also, along with 
a  digital  lock.  The  ‘Traditional  locks’  will  be  opened  at  the 
time when the bank opens. But the Digital lock on the door of 
customers’  locker  room  will  open  only  when  an  authentic 
customer  comes  with his  key  in  which  RFID tag is  embedded 
as  shown  in  fig.1.  This  digital lock  will  be  closed again  when 
the  customer  comes  out  of  the locker room.  If the door is not 
closed properly it will announce for the same as in case of lifts. 

LIGHT SENSOR 

A light sensor will be placed inside each locker. This sensor 
will  be  deactivated  for  a  single  locker  at  a  time.  When  the 
RFID  tag  number  matches  with  a  locker  number  and  the

MHz, 433 MHz, 900 MHz, and 2.4 GHz (microwaves) etc. [4].  

A typical RFID system consists of three components:  
1) An electronic data carrying device, called a transponder   
     or tag; 
2) Antennas and readers that facilitate tag interrogation; and 
3)  Software,  called  middleware,  that  controls  the  RFID 
equipment, manages the RFID data, and distributes information 
to  other  remote  data-processing  systems  by  interfacing  with 
enterprise applications [3]. 

The  major  advantages  of  passive  RFID  tags  are  it  is  cost 
effective  and  smaller  in  size.  Due  to  above  advantages,  it  is 
widely  use  by  inventory  tracking  technology  [3,  4].  Current 
antenna technology makes it possible for smaller size tags [5].   
 

II.  RELATED WORKS  

RFID  has  been  widely  used  for  security  enhancing, 

following are some major works done in this area. 

1.  First work is a door locking system using passive type of 
RFID  tag.  This  system  can  activate,  authenticate,  and 
validate  the  user  and  unlock  the  door  in  real  time  for 
secure  access  [1].  A  centralized  system  manages  the 
controlling,  transaction  and  operation  task.  The  door 
locking  system  functions  in  real  time  as  the  door  open 
quickly when user put their tag in contact of reader. The 
system also creates a log containing check-in and check-
out of each user along with basic information of user [1]. 
The  major  weakness  in  this  system  is  the  door  thickness 
request: 32mm ~ 45mm [1]; which is too small for bank locker 
and Strong rooms’ doors. In most of the banks the door size is 
of 6-10 inches and these are very heavy with multiple layers of 
steel sheets. Second drawback is it uses only one RFID card to 
open the door [1]; where as in the bank’s the double security is 
must.

2.  Second  work  has  implemented  a  bank  locker  security 
system  based  on  RFID  and  GSM  technology.  This 
contains  door  locking  system  using  RFID  and  GSM 
which  can  activate,  authenticate,  and  validate  the  user 
and unlock the door  in real time  for  bank locker  secure 
access  [2].  In  this  system  the  RFID  reader  reads  the  id

passwords  entered  by  the  key  board  and  received  from 
authenticated mobile  phone and if  these two  passwords 
are  matched  the locker  will  be  opened  otherwise it  will 
be remain in locked position [2].

It is not practically possible to implement this system due to 

following reasons –  

a) If there are no mobile towers, or the tower signals are too 
weak  then  system  fails.  (In  India  many  remote  areas 
don’t have mobile towers.) 

b) Sending the password over mobiles has its own hacking 

ricks involved.  

c)  Delay  in  the  message  sending  and  receiving  can  occur 

and even messages can be hacked.  

 

3. Some  other  security  works  are  on  the  security  of 
shopping  malls,  as  CCTV  doesn’t  provide  much  aid  to 
stop  the  shop-lifters  from  stealing items  in the  shop. In 
those  systems  a  passive  RFID  tag  is  attached  to  each 
item  in  the  shop  and  if  these  items  are  taken  out  of 
shop/mall  without  bill  payment  it  triggers  an  alarm  
warning  of  the  shoplifting  [11,12].  The  security  of  the 
cash section can also be achieved by RFID identity cards 
(ID) of the employees [12]. These RFID ID card restricts 
entry  of  the  employees  in  secured zone  where  cash and 
other documents are to be kept [12].  

But these systems are also insufficient for bank locker security. 

 

III.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

In  this  paper  we  propose  a  system  for  the  security  of 
‘Customer  lockers’,  ‘Strong  Rooms’  in  banks  and  ATM.  This 
system will have the RFID tagged Key for each locker, Digital 
Lock for the door of the Locker Room/Strong Room, Biometric 
Authentication  Devices,  Light  Sensor  Device  for  each  locker 
and  a  Database  which  will  store  all  the  related  information 
about the lockers as shown below.  

 
RFID Tagged Key 
 
Each  locker  holder  customer  will  have  only  one  physical 
key  with  the  RFID  tag  attached  to  it,  though  some  key  chain 
like mechanism.  As the  RFID  tag has a  unique number hence 
duplication  of  the  keys  will  not  be  possible.  The  RFID  tag 
number entry will be done along with the Bank Locker number. 
Note  the  locker  key  allocated  will  be  only  one.  We  propose 
passive  RFID  tags  which  are  much  cheaper  as  compared  to 
active tags. These are also smaller in size as compared to active 
tags  [3].  In  the  cases  when  a  customer  loosed  an  RFID  key, 
different  key  can  be  given  with  new  RFID  tag  after  proper 
verification  and  previous  will  be  deactivated  from  banking 
database.  

 

 

 
 
Figure 1: Proposed design of the system 

BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION DEVICE 

 

This  can  be  either  eye  retina  scan  or  the  finger  print  scan 
device.  Generally  owner  of  the  bank  locker  nominates  two 
persons, who can operate the locker. Usually one is the family 
member and other is the customer himself/herself. Hence, it is 
needed  to  store  the  biometric  authentication  of  both  the 
operators of a particular customer locker. In State Bank of India 
and  some  other  Banks  figure  print  authentication  devices  for 
the  bank  employees  are  already  installed  which  are  basically 
used  as  a  protection  to  access  banking  software.  Hence  for 
Indian Banks it can be extended for customer identification; as 
proposed in this paper.   

DATA BASE 

The Database will contain the detail information about each 
locker  like  the  name  of  the  customer,  mobile  number,  locker 
number,  RFID  tag  number  and  details  about  biometric 
authentication  of  the  locker  operators  like  figure  print  or  eye 
retina scan data along with their names. The Database will also 
have the Log Reports every time the locker is opened. This log 
may contain the name of the person who operated locker, date, 
time and duration for which the locker was open. 

DIGITAL LOCK 

We  don’t  promote  the  system  for  automatic  door  opening; 
rather  it  opens  a  simple  digital  lock  on  the  door  of  the  locker 
room.  Once  this  digital  lock  is  opened,  then  the  door  can  be 
opened manually. Looking at the developing countries and the 
problem  of  the  power  cut  (Electricity  shortage  problem),  it  is 
more  feasible to  open  digital lock than  to  open the door; as  it 
will  need  lesser  electrical  power  and  will  also  work  on 
generators  or  batteries.  This  means  the  door  of  the  customers 
locker room will have the ‘Traditional  Locks’ also, along with 
a  digital  lock.  The  ‘Traditional  locks’  will  be  opened  at  the 
time when the bank opens. But the Digital lock on the door of 
customers’  locker  room  will  open  only  when  an  authentic 
customer  comes  with his  key  in  which  RFID tag is  embedded 
as  shown  in  fig.1.  This  digital lock  will  be  closed again  when 
the  customer  comes  out  of  the locker room.  If the door is not 
closed properly it will announce for the same as in case of lifts. 

LIGHT SENSOR 

A light sensor will be placed inside each locker. This sensor 
will  be  deactivated  for  a  single  locker  at  a  time.  When  the 
RFID  tag  number  matches  with  a  locker  number  and  the

device. The computer gets the details from the database server 
customers’ biometric authentication also matches; then the light 
sensor  in  that  particular  locker  will  be  deactivated.  When  the 
about  the  locker  number  of  that  RFID  tag,  along  with  other 
data.  The  customer  authentication  is  done  by  matching  the 
customer comes out of the locker room this light sensor will be 
activated again. This helps in two things: 
stored eye/figure print.  

 
1)  Only  one  customer  can  be  inside  the  locker  room  at  a 
time. And only the locker (allocated to that particular customer) 
can  be  opened  at  that  time,  this  enhances  the  security  and  is 
similar to the present system in most of the banks in India. 

 
2) There are cases of robberies; in which the robbers dig the 
tunnel,  reached  inside  the  Customer  Locker  room,  cut  the 
lockers  and  looted  the  bank.  In  such  a  case,  the  small  light 
sensors  will  be  active  for  all  lockers.  Hence,  as  soon  as  the 
robbers  cut  any  locker  and  even  the  diffused  light  enters  into 
the  locker,  it  will  buzz an alarm. These  light  sensors are  quite 
cheap and can be installed using electric wires.  

 

WORKING 

As  explained  earlier  the  physical  locks  on  the  door  of  the 
locker room will be opened by the bank officers when the bank 
opens in the morning, like traditional way. But the digital lock 
will  still  closed.  Following  fig.  1  explains  briefly  about  the 
working logic. 
 

 

 

Fig. 2 Locker Operating Process 

 
As  shown  in  the  fig.2  when  a  customer  comes  with  the 
RFID tagged key, the  card reader reads the  RFID tag number, 
sends  the  data  to  the  computer  attached.  The  customer  gives 
his/her figure print  or eye scan on the biometric authentication 

 

If  the  biometric  authentication  matches  with  the 
nominated  person  for that particular  locker and  RFID tag  also 
matches  for  that  locker  number,  then  the  digital  lock  on  the 
door  of  the  locker  room  opens.  And  customer  now  can  walk 
inside  the  locker  room.  The  light  sensor  for  that  particular 
locker  is  deactivate,  where  as  the  light  sensors  of  all  other 
lockers will be active. Hence only that locker can be opened for 
which  the  biometric  and  RFID  tag  has  been  matched.  When 
customer steps out of the door, the RFID reader senses back the 
same  RFID  tag,  this  closes  the  digital  lock  and  activates  the 
light  sensor  inside  that  locker.  If  the  locker  room  door  is  not 
closed properly, it announces to close like in case of lifts. A log 
report  is  created  with details like name  of  person  who  opened 
locker,  date,  time  and  duration  etc.  The  security  can  be 
enhanced if the message is sent from the bank to the customer 
mobile number whenever the locker is opened.  If the RFID tag 
number  on  the  key  and  the  biometric  authentication  does  not 
match  an  alarm  will  buzz  informing  the  forgery.  Two 
customers will not be allowed to operate the locker at the same 
time; this will be cross verified by the exit of the RFID tag of 
that customer. 

STRONG ROOM AND ATM  

For  security  of  the  ’  Strong  Room’, the Chief  Cashier and 
Branch  Manager,  both  officers  will  have  two  separate  keys 
with  RFID  tags attached  to it like a key  chain.  And they  both 
have to record their biometric attendance along with the RFID 
keys, then  only  the  digital lock  will  open  for the  strong room. 
Even  if  one  of  the  RFID  or  biometric  authentication  doesn’t 
match the digital lock will not open. Here also due to RFID tag 
the keys cannot be duplicated.   

This  has  an  advantage  that  even  if  the  duplicate  keys  are 
made  their  RFID  numbers  cannot  be  duplicated  increasing 
security.  Also,  usually  bank  officers  hand  over  their  keys  to 
some other officer and keep themselves absent to open the door 
lock, but due to biometric authentication both the offices have 
to be present in person with the authentic keys. 

 
Inside the ATM machines, where the cash tray rests a light 
sensor can be installed. When some robbers cut this machine to 
take out the cash trays, light will enter inside the cash tray and 
the  light  sensor  will  buzz  an  alarm.  Also  an  RFID  tag  can  be 
installed inside an ATM so whenever the machine is taken out 
of the room it will buzz an alarm. These small equipments can 
make the ATMs robbery free.   

IV.  CONCLUSION 

Proposed  system  can  give  a  strong add  on  security  for  the 
Customer  Lockers,  Strong  Rooms  and  ATM  machines’  cash 
box. The proposed system needs lesser power (electricity) and 
it is cheaper as compared to the other systems developed. The 
passive  RFID  tags  are  recommended  with  light  sensors  and  a 
digital  lock  which  minimizes  the  cost.  The  system  can  be 
enhanced by attaching the existing GSM system for sending the 
messages to the customers’ or Bank Officers mobiles when the 
customer 
are  opened 
respectively.

Abstract— Radio frequency identification, or RFID, is an emerging technology that wirelessly transmits an identification number from a  small 
inexpensive device,  called  a  tag, to  devices,  called readers,  capable  of  communicating  with the tag. The  technology  enables  a  single  reader to 
inventory hundreds of tagged items per second, wirelessly and without line-of-sight; tags can remain in enclosures or packaging materials. This 
paper surveys the various areas where RFID has been implemented in various countries & proposes a system which can be used / implemented 
by Banks, for various security measures. The CCTV cameras which are used in the banks, for the security purposes do not prove much efficient 
to  stop  forgery,  or  robbery.  There  are some  recent  cases  in  India where  some  internal  officer  made  duplicate locker  keys  and  then used  it  for 
robbery, it came to notice only when these lockers were opened. The concept of this proposal is RFID embedded locker keys. These keys can be 
used along with personal identification of the locker holder like figure print or eye retina scan etc. The officers who enter the locker room their 
RFID enabled strong room keys also will be attached to their biometric authentication, so the system can restrict and buzz an alarm when anyone 
without authentication tries to enter.  Also this  could  help to track the list  of  officers  for investigation in  case  of  robber y.  The time and  date  of 
entry and exit can also be noted. Applied properly this system will help to improve the security of the Banks.

I. 

 INTRODUCTION  

Almost  in  all  the  nationalized  banks  in  India;  lockers  are 
provided to the customers where they can keep their valuables. 
These lockers work on two keys; one key is with customer and 
the  other is master key  of  the lockers  which  is  with  the  bank. 
The  ‘Strong  Room’  lock  also  needs  two  keys,  which  are  with 
Head cashier and Branch manager. There are some recent cases 
in India where some internal officer made duplicate locker keys 
and then used it for robbery, it came to notice only when these 
lockers were opened. In some of the robbery cases the robbers 
dig  a  tunnel  and  cut  the  lockers  /  ATM  machine.    These  all 
cases points’ to the following loop holes in the present system. 

  Almost  all  banks  have  manual  authentication  of 
customers.    Yet,  non  authorized  family  members  can 
be  allowed  (if  it  suits  to  the  conscious  of  the  bank 
officer). 

  The  Bank  officers  can  easily  duplicate  the  keys  for 

future misuse.  
If the keys are stolen the whole lockers are insecure.  

 
  No security of lockers/ ATM is assured if robbers cut 

them. 

This  paper  focuses  on  how  to  enhance  security  of  Strong 
Room,  Customer  Lockers  and  ATM  using  Radio-frequency 
identification 
technology  along  with  Biometric 
authentication techniques. This paper proposes a system design 
for this add on security to the bank lockers, strong room. 

(RFID) 

 

RFID 

An  RFID 

system  can  be  considered  a  wireless 
communication system since the reader communicates with the 
tags by using electromagnetic waves at radio frequencies. RFID 
systems  can  be  categorized  as  active  and  passive  systems  [3]. 
In an active  system,  the tag  (i.e.  active  RFID tag) has  its  own 
power  source,  which  is  a  battery,  enclosed  in  the  transponder 
housing. In passive system, the tag does not have its own power 
source; instead, it draws power from the reader’s radio signals. 
Passive tags are inexpensive compared to active tags [3]. Every 
RFID  label  carries  a  globally  unique  read  only  serial  number 

defined  at  manufacture.  In  addition,  there  is  a  user  definable 
read–write  memory  of  between  64  bits  and  2  kbits  [4].  RFID 
operates  in  several  different  radio  bands:  0–135  kHz,  13.56 
MHz, 433 MHz, 900 MHz, and 2.4 GHz (microwaves) etc. [4].  

A typical RFID system consists of three components:  
1) An electronic data carrying device, called a transponder   
     or tag; 
2) Antennas and readers that facilitate tag interrogation; and 
3)  Software,  called  middleware,  that  controls  the  RFID 
equipment, manages the RFID data, and distributes information 
to  other  remote  data-processing  systems  by  interfacing  with 
enterprise applications [3]. 

The  major  advantages  of  passive  RFID  tags  are  it  is  cost 
effective  and  smaller  in  size.  Due  to  above  advantages,  it  is 
widely  use  by  inventory  tracking  technology  [3,  4].  Current 
antenna technology makes it possible for smaller size tags [5].   
 

II.  RELATED WORKS  

RFID  has  been  widely  used  for  security  enhancing, 

following are some major works done in this area. 

1.  First work is a door locking system using passive type of 
RFID  tag.  This  system  can  activate,  authenticate,  and 
validate  the  user  and  unlock  the  door  in  real  time  for 
secure  access  [1].  A  centralized  system  manages  the 
controlling,  transaction  and  operation  task.  The  door 
locking  system  functions  in  real  time  as  the  door  open 
quickly when user put their tag in contact of reader. The 
system also creates a log containing check-in and check-
out of each user along with basic information of user [1]. 
The  major  weakness  in  this  system  is  the  door  thickness 
request: 32mm ~ 45mm [1]; which is too small for bank locker 
and Strong rooms’ doors. In most of the banks the door size is 
of 6-10 inches and these are very heavy with multiple layers of 
steel sheets. Second drawback is it uses only one RFID card to 
open the door [1]; where as in the bank’s the double security is 
must.

system  based  on  RFID  and  GSM  technology.  This 
contains  door  locking  system  using  RFID  and  GSM 
which  can  activate,  authenticate,  and  validate  the  user

passwords  entered  by  the  key  board  and  received  from 
authenticated mobile  phone and if  these two  passwords 
are  matched  the locker  will  be  opened  otherwise it  will 
be remain in locked position [2].

It is not practically possible to implement this system due to 

following reasons –  

a) If there are no mobile towers, or the tower signals are too 
weak  then  system  fails.  (In  India  many  remote  areas 
don’t have mobile towers.) 

b) Sending the password over mobiles has its own hacking 

ricks involved.  

c)  Delay  in  the  message  sending  and  receiving  can  occur 

and even messages can be hacked.  

 

3. Some  other  security  works  are  on  the  security  of 
shopping  malls,  as  CCTV  doesn’t  provide  much  aid  to 
stop  the  shop-lifters  from  stealing items  in the  shop. In 
those  systems  a  passive  RFID  tag  is  attached  to  each 
item  in  the  shop  and  if  these  items  are  taken  out  of 
shop/mall  without  bill  payment  it  triggers  an  alarm  
warning  of  the  shoplifting  [11,12].  The  security  of  the 
cash section can also be achieved by RFID identity cards 
(ID) of the employees [12]. These RFID ID card restricts 
entry  of  the  employees  in  secured zone  where  cash and 
other documents are to be kept [12].  

But these systems are also insufficient for bank locker security. 

 

III.  PROPOSED SYSTEM 

In  this  paper  we  propose  a  system  for  the  security  of 
‘Customer  lockers’,  ‘Strong  Rooms’  in  banks  and  ATM.  This 
system will have the RFID tagged Key for each locker, Digital 
Lock for the door of the Locker Room/Strong Room, Biometric 
Authentication  Devices,  Light  Sensor  Device  for  each  locker 
and  a  Database  which  will  store  all  the  related  information 
about the lockers as shown below.  

 
RFID Tagged Key 
 
Each  locker  holder  customer  will  have  only  one  physical 
key  with  the  RFID  tag  attached  to  it,  though  some  key  chain 
like mechanism.  As the  RFID  tag has a  unique number hence 
duplication  of  the  keys  will  not  be  possible.  The  RFID  tag 
number entry will be done along with the Bank Locker number. 
Note  the  locker  key  allocated  will  be  only  one.  We  propose 
passive  RFID  tags  which  are  much  cheaper  as  compared  to 
active tags. These are also smaller in size as compared to active 
tags  [3].  In  the  cases  when  a  customer  loosed  an  RFID  key, 
different  key  can  be  given  with  new  RFID  tag  after  proper 
verification  and  previous  will  be  deactivated  from  banking 
database.

BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION DEVICE 

 

This  can  be  either  eye  retina  scan  or  the  finger  print  scan 
device.  Generally  owner  of  the  bank  locker  nominates  two 
persons, who can operate the locker. Usually one is the family 
member and other is the customer himself/herself. Hence, it is 
needed  to  store  the  biometric  authentication  of  both  the 
operators of a particular customer locker. In State Bank of India 
and  some  other  Banks  figure  print  authentication  devices  for 
the  bank  employees  are  already  installed  which  are  basically 
used  as  a  protection  to  access  banking  software.  Hence  for 
Indian Banks it can be extended for customer identification; as 
proposed in this paper.   

DATA BASE 

The Database will contain the detail information about each 
locker  like  the  name  of  the  customer,  mobile  number,  locker 
number,  RFID  tag  number  and  details  about  biometric 
authentication  of  the  locker  operators  like  figure  print  or  eye 
retina scan data along with their names. The Database will also 
have the Log Reports every time the locker is opened. This log 
may contain the name of the person who operated locker, date, 
time and duration for which the locker was open. 

DIGITAL LOCK 

We  don’t  promote  the  system  for  automatic  door  opening; 
rather  it  opens  a  simple  digital  lock  on  the  door  of  the  locker 
room.  Once  this  digital  lock  is  opened,  then  the  door  can  be 
opened manually. Looking at the developing countries and the 
problem  of  the  power  cut  (Electricity  shortage  problem),  it  is 
more  feasible to  open  digital lock than  to  open the door; as  it 
will  need  lesser  electrical  power  and  will  also  work  on 
generators  or  batteries.  This  means  the  door  of  the  customers 
locker room will have the ‘Traditional  Locks’ also, along with 
a  digital  lock.  The  ‘Traditional  locks’  will  be  opened  at  the 
time when the bank opens. But the Digital lock on the door of 
customers’  locker  room  will  open  only  when  an  authentic 
customer  comes  with his  key  in  which  RFID tag is  embedded 
as  shown  in  fig.1.  This  digital lock  will  be  closed again  when 
the  customer  comes  out  of  the locker room.  If the door is not 
closed properly it will announce for the same as in case of lifts. 

LIGHT SENSOR 

A light sensor will be placed inside each locker. This sensor 
will  be  deactivated  for  a  single  locker  at  a  time.  When  the 
RFID  tag  number  matches  with  a  locker  number  and  the

device. The computer gets the details from the database server 
customers’ biometric authentication also matches; then the light 
sensor  in  that  particular  locker  will  be  deactivated.  When  the 
about  the  locker  number  of  that  RFID  tag,  along  with  other 
data.  The  customer  authentication  is  done  by  matching  the 
customer comes out of the locker room this light sensor will be 
activated again. This helps in two things: 
stored eye/figure print.  

 
1)  Only  one  customer  can  be  inside  the  locker  room  at  a 
time. And only the locker (allocated to that particular customer) 
can  be  opened  at  that  time,  this  enhances  the  security  and  is 
similar to the present system in most of the banks in India. 

 
2) There are cases of robberies; in which the robbers dig the 
tunnel,  reached  inside  the  Customer  Locker  room,  cut  the 
lockers  and  looted  the  bank.  In  such  a  case,  the  small  light 
sensors  will  be  active  for  all  lockers.  Hence,  as  soon  as  the 
robbers  cut  any  locker  and  even  the  diffused  light  enters  into 
the  locker,  it  will  buzz an alarm. These  light  sensors are  quite 
cheap and can be installed using electric wires.  

 

WORKING 

As  explained  earlier  the  physical  locks  on  the  door  of  the 
locker room will be opened by the bank officers when the bank 
opens in the morning, like traditional way. But the digital lock 
will  still  closed.  Following  fig.  1  explains  briefly  about  the 
working logic. 
 

 

 

Fig. 2 Locker Operating Process 

 
As  shown  in  the  fig.2  when  a  customer  comes  with  the 
RFID tagged key, the  card reader reads the  RFID tag number, 
sends  the  data  to  the  computer  attached.  The  customer  gives 
his/her figure print  or eye scan on the biometric authentication 

 

If  the  biometric  authentication  matches  with  the 
nominated  person  for that particular  locker and  RFID tag  also 
matches  for  that  locker  number,  then  the  digital  lock  on  the 
door  of  the  locker  room  opens.  And  customer  now  can  walk 
inside  the  locker  room.  The  light  sensor  for  that  particular 
locker  is  deactivate,  where  as  the  light  sensors  of  all  other 
lockers will be active. Hence only that locker can be opened for 
which  the  biometric  and  RFID  tag  has  been  matched.  When 
customer steps out of the door, the RFID reader senses back the 
same  RFID  tag,  this  closes  the  digital  lock  and  activates  the 
light  sensor  inside  that  locker.  If  the  locker  room  door  is  not 
closed properly, it announces to close like in case of lifts. A log 
report  is  created  with details like name  of  person  who  opened 
locker,  date,  time  and  duration  etc.  The  security  can  be 
enhanced if the message is sent from the bank to the customer 
mobile number whenever the locker is opened.  If the RFID tag 
number  on  the  key  and  the  biometric  authentication  does  not 
match  an  alarm  will  buzz  informing  the  forgery.  Two 
customers will not be allowed to operate the locker at the same 
time; this will be cross verified by the exit of the RFID tag of 
that customer. 

STRONG ROOM AND ATM  

For  security  of  the  ’  Strong  Room’, the Chief  Cashier and 
Branch  Manager,  both  officers  will  have  two  separate  keys 
with  RFID  tags attached  to it like a key  chain.  And they  both 
have to record their biometric attendance along with the RFID 
keys, then  only  the  digital lock  will  open  for the  strong room. 
Even  if  one  of  the  RFID  or  biometric  authentication  doesn’t 
match the digital lock will not open. Here also due to RFID tag 
the keys cannot be duplicated.   

This  has  an  advantage  that  even  if  the  duplicate  keys  are 
made  their  RFID  numbers  cannot  be  duplicated  increasing 
security.  Also,  usually  bank  officers  hand  over  their  keys  to 
some other officer and keep themselves absent to open the door 
lock, but due to biometric authentication both the offices have 
to be present in person with the authentic keys. 

 
Inside the ATM machines, where the cash tray rests a light 
sensor can be installed. When some robbers cut this machine to 
take out the cash trays, light will enter inside the cash tray and 
the  light  sensor  will  buzz  an  alarm.  Also  an  RFID  tag  can  be 
installed inside an ATM so whenever the machine is taken out 
of the room it will buzz an alarm. These small equipments can 
make the ATMs robbery free.   

IV.  CONCLUSION 

Proposed  system  can  give  a  strong add  on  security  for  the 
Customer  Lockers,  Strong  Rooms  and  ATM  machines’  cash 
box. The proposed system needs lesser power (electricity) and 
it is cheaper as compared to the other systems developed. The 
passive  RFID  tags  are  recommended  with  light  sensors  and  a 
digital  lock  which  minimizes  the  cost.  The  system  can  be 
enhanced by attaching the existing GSM system for sending the 
messages to the customers’ or Bank Officers mobiles when the 
customer 
are  opened 
respectively.
