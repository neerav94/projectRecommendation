Abstract—Detecting and recognizing runway holding position
signs and hold-short lines are of signiﬁcant safety interest for
runway incursion avoidance. It is an important supplement to
pilots’ education and airport ground radar to enhance safety,
particularly at complex major airports. In this project, we lever-
age the standards of airport signs and markings for the detection
and recognition purposes. For sign detection and recognition, an
HSV color space based algorithm is developed to detect runway
holding positions signs and Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
is used to recognized the signs. For line detection, Canny Edge
Detection and Hough Transform are used to recognize major
line features in the images, and a heuristic algorithm leveraging
the layout characteristics of the images is used to determine the
presence of hold-short lines among those lines. An accuracy of
95.1% is achieved for runway holding position signs detection and
recognition while an accuracy of 89.2% is achieved for runway
hold-short line detection.

I. MOTIVATION AND INTRODUCTION

A runway incursion is deﬁned as any occurrence in the
airport runway environment
involving an aircraft, vehicle,
person, or object on the ground that creates a collision
hazard or results in a loss of required separation with an
aircraft taking off, intending to take off, landing, or intending
to land. In the United States, an average of three runway
incursions occur daily[1]. Multiple factors contribute to
runway incursion, including failure to comply with air trafﬁc
control (ATC) instructions,
lack of airport familiarity and
nonconformance with standard operating procedures. A
typical runway incursion scenario is shown in ﬁgure 1[1].

In this project, we target

223 images obtained from the ground operation of an aircraft
are tested using this method and the result is shown in Table

A. Work Flow for Runway Holding Position Signs Detection
Regulated by International Civil Aviation Organization
(ICAO) and Federal Aviation of Administration (FAA), runway
holding position signs have red as background and white as
characters[2][3]. A color-based method is developed on these
standards. Since the colors in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color
space not only contain color information, but also intensity
information, using RGB color space would not be versatile in
different brightness conditions[4]. Therefore, we ﬁrst convert
the RGB color space into Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color
space, where the brightness information is only stored in the
V channel.

Before the OCR is applied the cropped image, Top-Hat
Filtering is applied to reconstruct the image because that the
cropped image sign is small in dimensions and may contain dirt

Then, a Median Filter of window size 3×3 is applied to reduce
the noise on the image. After the OCR recognition, the result
is further validated by examining whether the recognized sign
is a valid runway number. The valid runway number can only
be from 00-36 since the number corresponds to the magnetic
heading of the runway.

Transform is applied to locate edges that are straight lines
and the midpoints of those straight
lines are calculated.
Those straight lines and midpoints are of signiﬁcant interest
to us because that
the two dashed lines in the runway
hold-short lines would greatly contribute to those segmented
straight
to the
segmented straight lines and midpoints are the horizon in the
input image. Furthermore, the segmented straight lines and
midpoints from the hold-short line and the horizon exhibit a
clustering property, with the hold-short line position being 100
pixels below the peak in the y direction while the hold-short
line position being approximately the same as the peak in
histogram in the x direction. Since hold-short
lines often
occur in a rectangular window of size 600 by 200 pixels, two
windows are searched, one with (PeakX, PeakY-100) as the
top right corner (left window), and the other with PeakX,
PeakY-100) as the top left corner (right window). The number
of midpoints in these two windows are computed respectively,
and if the count is larger than our threshold of 5 in any of
them, it is determined that hold-short lines are present.

Input images would typically come from consecutive video
frames, so the location of hold-short lines from one image to
the next one would only change by a relatively small amount.
We record PeakX and PeakY values from the previous image.
If no hold-short lines were detected in the previous image,
these values were both set to 0, and we proceed according
to the previously described algorithm. Otherwise,
the two
windows near the previous PeakX and PeakY position also
need to be searched. The number of consecutive images that
have hold-short lines detected are also kept. If no hold-short
line has yet been detected, then a stricter criterion would be
imposed that requires the sum of midpoints in both left and
right windows to exceed a certain threshold of 12 to determine
that hold-short lines are present.

223 images obtained from the ground operation of an
aircraft are tested using this algorithm and the result is shown
in table II. We can see that the detection has high recall yet
relatively low precision. It is caused by either the similar mark-
ings in the airport environment including taxi lines, movement-
nonmovement lines and etc or the random line clustering in the
background scene. The advantage of the algorithm is that false
positives rarely occur consecutively, so these false warnings to
the pilots would quickly disappear even if they appear at some
point. The overall accuracy is 89.2%.

windows near the previous PeakX and PeakY position also
need to be searched. The number of consecutive images that
have hold-short lines detected are also kept. If no hold-short
line has yet been detected, then a stricter criterion would be
imposed that requires the sum of midpoints in both left and
right windows to exceed a certain threshold of 12 to determine
that hold-short lines are present.

input

A typical runway hold-short

line detection scenario is
shown in the following ﬁgures. The original
image
is shown in Figure 6. The Canny Edges obtained using the
Canny Edge Detector are shown in Figure 7. The segmented
straight lines obtained from the Hough Transform are shown
in Figure 8. The peak point
in both x and y direction
histograms is shown in Figure 9. The window drawing from
the peak point is shown in Figure 10. Figure 11 displays the
warning information regarding the runway hold-short
line
with the original input image.

223 images obtained from the ground operation of an
aircraft are tested using this algorithm and the result is shown
in table II. We can see that the detection has high recall yet
relatively low precision. It is caused by either the similar mark-
ings in the airport environment including taxi lines, movement-
nonmovement lines and etc or the random line clustering in the
background scene. The advantage of the algorithm is that false
positives rarely occur consecutively, so these false warnings to
the pilots would quickly disappear even if they appear at some
point. The overall accuracy is 89.2%.

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We have developed algorithms to detect and recognize
and runway hold-short
runway holding position signs
lines with high detection recall and overall accuracy.
It
is important to notice that in our application, recall is of
more importance than precision because that even though
false positives may be annoying,
false negatives could
lead to accidents. In addition, our algorithms require no time
in training and runs on the order of sub-second on each image.

Our approach can be further extended to detect other airport
signs and markings of operation safety interest. We believe
this a promising way to promote pilots’ situational awareness
when operating at complex major airports and enhance runway
incursion avoidance. Future directions include: (1) Set up a
database for airport signs and markings and combine feature-
based methods to existing methods to enhance the robustness
against perspective distortion, image blur, night operation and
false positives caused by similar objects in the vicinity. (2) Ex-
pand the system’s capability to detect airport location/direction
signs, ILS hold-short
lines, movement-nonmovement hold
