architecture  will  described  as  a  basis  in  ITU-T 
recommendations,  which  is  divided  into    five  levels 
for  bottom-up,  such  as  sensor  networks,  access

and 
application  platforms.  In  addition  to  ITU,  other 
international  standardization  organizations  describe

and Classification 

factors, 

 
Fiber  optic  sensor  not  only  has 

the  basic 
technology  with  traditional  sensors,  but  also  has 
many  unique  advantages.  When  the  optical  fiber 
sensor uses the light transmission through the optical 
fiber,  its  phase,  polarization,  wavelength  and  other 
parameters  change  with  external 
the 
corresponding  changes  are  sensed  in  the  external 
physical  quantity,  the  sensing  measurements  are 
realized.  The  basic  working  principle  of  the  optical 
fiber sensor is that the light from the light source is 
fed  to  the  modulator  via  an  optical  fiber,  after  the 
measured parameter is interacted with the light which 
enters  modulation  region,  the  optical  properties  of 
light  (e.g.,  light  intensity,  wavelength,  frequency, 
phase, Modifier state, etc.) are resulted in change, it 
is  referred  to  as  the  modulated  signal  light,  then 
which is fed to the light detector through the optical 
fiber,  after  demodulation,  the  measured  parameters 
are obtained [14]. Fiber optic gyro sensor principle is 
shown in Fig. 3. 

Compared  with  the  conventional  sensor,  optical 
fiber  sensor  has  many  advantages,  such  as  that  the 

 
 

broadcast information is transmitted, electromagnetic 
interference  is  immuned,  corrosion  resistance,  anti-
hypertension  (high  pressure).  By  using  a  phase-
coherent technology, it has high sensitivity, and light 
weight,  small  size,  and  applicability.  And 
its 
frequency  is  bandwidth,  there  is  the  wide  dynamic 
range,  the  reliability  and  accuracy  are  improved  on 
the measurements, in addition, fiber optic sensors can 
also detect various physical quantities, this research is 
a  major  breakthrough  within 
range  of  
the sensor.

Fiber  optic  sensor  can  be  divided  into  two 
categories  by  sensing  principle,  one  is  called  as 
functional sensors, the optical fiber role are both the 
signal transmission and its sensitive, it has a unity of 
sense and mass characteristics. Another is known as 
non-functional  sensors,  which  only  serves  as  an 
optical  fiber  transmission,  and  the  feeling  of  the 
signal  is  to  use  the  other  to  complete  the  optical 
sensor.  By  modulation  principle  of 
in  
the  fiber,  fiber  optic  sensors  can  be  divided  into 
several

modulation, polarization modulation and wavelength

and Classification 

factors, 

 
Fiber  optic  sensor  not  only  has 

the  basic 
technology  with  traditional  sensors,  but  also  has 
many  unique  advantages.  When  the  optical  fiber 
sensor uses the light transmission through the optical 
fiber,  its  phase,  polarization,  wavelength  and  other 
parameters  change  with  external 
the 
corresponding  changes  are  sensed  in  the  external 
physical  quantity,  the  sensing  measurements  are 
realized.  The  basic  working  principle  of  the  optical 
fiber sensor is that the light from the light source is 
fed  to  the  modulator  via  an  optical  fiber,  after  the 
measured parameter is interacted with the light which 
enters  modulation  region,  the  optical  properties  of 
light  (e.g.,  light  intensity,  wavelength,  frequency, 
phase, Modifier state, etc.) are resulted in change, it 
is  referred  to  as  the  modulated  signal  light,  then 
which is fed to the light detector through the optical 
fiber,  after  demodulation,  the  measured  parameters 
are obtained [14]. Fiber optic gyro sensor principle is 
shown in Fig. 3. 

Compared  with  the  conventional  sensor,  optical 
fiber  sensor  has  many  advantages,  such  as  that  the 

 
 

broadcast information is transmitted, electromagnetic 
interference  is  immuned,  corrosion  resistance,  anti-
hypertension  (high  pressure).  By  using  a  phase-
coherent technology, it has high sensitivity, and light 
weight,  small  size,  and  applicability.  And 
its 
frequency  is  bandwidth,  there  is  the  wide  dynamic 
range,  the  reliability  and  accuracy  are  improved  on 
the measurements, in addition, fiber optic sensors can 
also detect various physical quantities, this research is 
a  major  breakthrough  within 
range  of  
the sensor.

Fiber  optic  sensor  can  be  divided  into  two 
categories  by  sensing  principle,  one  is  called  as 
functional sensors, the optical fiber role are both the 
signal transmission and its sensitive, it has a unity of 
sense and mass characteristics. Another is known as 
non-functional  sensors,  which  only  serves  as  an 
optical  fiber  transmission,  and  the  feeling  of  the 
signal  is  to  use  the  other  to  complete  the  optical

Also,  its  sense  unity  characteristics  is  suitable  for  a 
distributed  sensing  system,  the  continuous  sensing 
detection  and  transmission  are  realized  over  long 
distance  lines,  which  is  very  necessary  in  IOT 
network, it is suitable to build network architecture of 
things [16]. 

 
 

 
 

4.2. Application Case Study 

information 

 
In  the  connectivity  platform  cloud  technology 
research  of  the  mine  fiber  IOT,  we  focus  on  mine 
safety  detection  problem,  we  propose  a  universal 
fiber optic sensor IOT interfaces, a fiber-optic sensor 
IOT is built [17]. System is connected by the user, the 
Internet,  cloud  platform,  and  fiber  optic  sensors, 
wherein  the  optical  fiber  sensor  is  a  main  way  to 
collect 
for  monitoring  mine  gas 
concentration, temperature, level, vibration, humidity, 
dust  concentration,  harmful  gases,  etc.  In  the  cloud 
connected  platform,  the  collected  information  is 
acquired  with  a  wide  range  of  the  optical  fiber 
sensors  and  its  different  parameters,  and  through 
signal conversion, unified transport protocol and data 
format are uploaded ultimately to the control room or 
the  Internet  on  Inoue,  but  also  the  terminal  control 
command  is  accessed,  the  command  is  converted  to 
the  instruction  format,  which  can  be  identified  in 
terminal  device,  that  is  sent  to  the  device  control 
terminal for device to be controlled. Internet function 
is to transmit information. This system of coal mine 
safety provides a more effective solution, the ability 
and  level  of  coal  mine  safety  testing  have  been  to 
greatly  enhanced  [17].  Fiber  optic  ring  network 
transmission of security monitoring system is shown 
in Fig. 6.

2) The temperature, current and other parameters 
need to be determined in the power system, such as 
the inside detection of high-voltage transformer and 
large  motor  stator  and  rotor  temperature,  because 
electromagnetic 
to 
electrical  interference,  which  can’t  be  used  in  such 
occasions,  only  fiber  optic  sensors  can  be  used. 
Distributed  fiber  optic 
temperature  sensors  are 
developed in recent years, it is a high-tech for real-
field 
time  measurement  of  space 
distribution.  Optical 
sensor 
application  in  on-line  monitoring  of  power  high-
voltage switch  is shown in Fig. 5.

3) Fiber optic sensors can be used to temperature 
measurement  on  flammable  materials  production 
processes  and  equipment.  Fiber  optic  sensor  is 
essentially  a  anti-fire  and  anti-explosion  device,  it 
does not require the use of explosion-proof measures, 
and  it  is  very  safe  and  reliable.  Compared  with 
electrical  sensors,  both  costs  are  reduced  and  the 
sensitivity can be improved [16].  

In addition, fiber optic sensor is also possible to

5. Conclusions and Outlook 

 
IOT  framework 

technology  and  fiber  optic 
sensing technology has been studied in this paper, the 
optical  fiber  sensing  technology  applications  are 
analyzed  in  IOT  perception  layer,  and    the  specific 
applications  of  the  optical  fiber  sensing  things  are 
studied in mine safety testing, that fiber-optic sensor 
network  is  found  to  provide  greater  protection  for 
mine  safety,  based  on  this,  we  can  predict  that  the 
fiber-optic  sensing  things  will  have  the  greater 
development and application space in the future.
