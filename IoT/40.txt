In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration).

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

deployments. The purpose of this paper is to assess and an­
swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed.

ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal

tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

deployments. The purpose of this paper is to assess and an­
swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

into the Internet of Things, have been already enumerated 
by the research community [3,22,23]. They are as follows: 

•  Heterogeneity  has  a  great  inﬂuence  over  the  protocol 
and  network  security  services  that  must  be  imple­
mented  in  the  IoT.  Constrained  devices  will  interact 
with  various  heterogeneous  devices  (e.g.  other  con­
strained  devices,  full-ﬂedged  web  servers)  either 
directly or through gateways. In this scenario, not only 
it is essential to implement efﬁcient cryptographic algo­
rithms that can provide a high throughput even in 8-bit 
or 16-bit devices, but also to adapt or create lightweight 
security protocols that offer an end-to-end secure com­
munication  channel.  These  protocols  require  creden­
tials,  thus  optimal  key  management  systems  must  be 
implemented to distribute these credentials and to help 
in  establishing  the  necessary  session  keys  between 
peers. 

•  The existence of billions of heterogeneous objects also 
affects  identity  management.  Beyond  deﬁning  the 
actual scope of ‘identity’ in this context (e.g. underlying 
identity  vs.  real  identity,  core  identity  vs.  temporary 
identity),  we  also  need  to  provide  some  mechanisms 
for achieving universal authentication. Without authen­
tication,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  assure  that  the  data 
ﬂow  produced  by  a  certain  entity  contains  what  it  is 
supposed to contain. Another important aspect related 
to  authentication  is  authorization.  If  there  is  no  access 
control  whatsoever,  everything  will  be  accessed  by 
everyone, which is neither viable nor realistic. 

•  In fact, the data deluge caused by billions of entities cre­
ating information is a big threat to privacy. Users must 
have tools that allow them to retain their anonymity in 
this superconnected world. Other tools must provide a 
snapshot  of  the  information  and  policies  surrounding 
a particular user, enabling transparency and preventing 
the notion that the IoT is silently controlling our lives. 
In fact, the IoT itself must seriously consider the imple­
mentation of the privacy by design principles [24], pro­
viding  user-centric  support  for  security  and  privacy 
from its very own foundations. 

•  The  size  and  heterogeneity  of  the  IoT  also  affects  its 
trust  and  governance.  There  are  actually  two  dimen­
sions of trust: (a) trust in the interaction between enti­
ties, where we have to deal with uncertainty about the 
future actions of all collaborating entities, and (b) trust 
in  the  system  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  user,  as 
users must be able to manage their things so as to not 
feel  under  some  unknown  external  control.  Regarding 
governance,  it  is  a  double-edged  sword  that  must  be 
wielded with care. On the  one hand, it offers  stability, 
support  for  political  decisions,  and  the  possibility  to 
deﬁne common frameworks and interoperability mech­
anisms.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily 
become  excessive, 
fostering  an  over-controlled 
environment. 

•  The number of vulnerable systems and attacks vectors 
will surely increase in the context of the IoT, thus fault 
tolerance  becomes  essential.  Not  only  we  must  strive 
for  security  by  default  (robust  implementations,  usable 
systems,  etc.)  in  the  IoT,  but  also  we  need  to  develop 

awareness  mechanisms  that  can  be  used  to  create  the 
foundations of intrusion detection and prevention mecha­
nisms,  which  will  help  IoT  entities  to  protect  or  even 
gracefully  degrade  their  services.  Finally,  recovery  ser­
vices  must  be  able  to  locate  unsafe  zones  (i.e.  zones 
affected  by  attacks)  and  redirect  the  functionality  of 
the systems to other trusted zones. 

3.2. Analysis of attacker models and threats 

As aforementioned, in order to understand how the dif­
ferent  approaches  presented  in  Section  2.2  should  be  se­
cured  in  the  future,  it  is  ﬁrstly  necessary  to  enumerate 
and analyze the attacker models. These models have been 
deﬁned in a way that they can be applied to both central­
ized  and  distributed  IoT  approaches.  Note,  however,  that 
the  concept  of  ‘perimeter’  in  the  Internet  of  Things  is  a 
bit  fuzzy:  an  attacker  can  control  part  of  the  network, 
but due to the inherent distributed nature of the IoT, it is 
nearly impossible for an attacker to fully control the whole 
system. As a result, an attacker can be both ‘internal’ and 
‘external’ at the same time. These attacker models, catego­
rized by threats, are introduced in the following paragraph. 

•  Denial  of  service  (DoS).  There are a wide number of DoS 
attacks that can be launched against the IoT. Beyond tradi­
tional Internet DoS attacks that exhaust service provider 
resources  and  network  bandwidth,  the  actual  wireless 
communication  infrastructure  of  most  data  acquisition 
networks can also be targeted (e.g. jamming the channels). 
Malicious internal attackers that take control of part of the 
infrastructure can create even more mayhem. 

•  Physical damage. This threat can be seen as a subset of 
the DoS threat. In this attacker model, active attackers 
usually lack  technical  knowledge, and  can  only hinder 
the provisioning of IoT services by destroying the actual 
‘things’.  This  is  a  realistic  attack  in  the  IoT  context, 
because  things  might  be  easily  accessible  to  anyone 
(e.g.  a  street  light).  If  that  is  not  possible,  the  attacker 
can simply target the hardware module in charge of cre­
ating the ‘virtual persona’ of the thing. 

•  Eavesdropping. Passive attackers can target various com­
munication channels (e.g. wireless networks, local wired 
networks,  Internet)  in  order  to  extract  data  from  the 
information  ﬂow.  Obviously,  an  internal  attacker  that 
gains  access  to  a  particular  infrastructure  will  be  able 
to  extract  the  information  that  circulates  within  that 
infrastructure. 

•  Node Capture. As aforementioned, things (e.g. household 
appliances, street lights) are physically located in a cer­
tain environment. Instead of destroying them, an active 
attacker can try to extract the information they contain. 
Note  also  that,  instead  of  things,  active  attackers  can 
also target other infrastructures that store information, 
such as data processing or data storage entities. 

•  Controlling.  As  long  as  there  is  an  attack  path,  active 
attackers can try to gain partial or full control over an 
IoT  entity.  The  scope  of  the  damage  caused  by  these 
attackers depends mainly on (a) the importance of the 
data managed by that particular entity, (b) the services 
that are provided by that particular entity.

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

deployments. The purpose of this paper is to assess and an­
swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

into the Internet of Things, have been already enumerated 
by the research community [3,22,23]. They are as follows: 

•  Heterogeneity  has  a  great  inﬂuence  over  the  protocol 
and  network  security  services  that  must  be  imple­
mented  in  the  IoT.  Constrained  devices  will  interact 
with  various  heterogeneous  devices  (e.g.  other  con­
strained  devices,  full-ﬂedged  web  servers)  either 
directly or through gateways. In this scenario, not only 
it is essential to implement efﬁcient cryptographic algo­
rithms that can provide a high throughput even in 8-bit 
or 16-bit devices, but also to adapt or create lightweight 
security protocols that offer an end-to-end secure com­
munication  channel.  These  protocols  require  creden­
tials,  thus  optimal  key  management  systems  must  be 
implemented to distribute these credentials and to help 
in  establishing  the  necessary  session  keys  between 
peers. 

•  The existence of billions of heterogeneous objects also 
affects  identity  management.  Beyond  deﬁning  the 
actual scope of ‘identity’ in this context (e.g. underlying 
identity  vs.  real  identity,  core  identity  vs.  temporary 
identity),  we  also  need  to  provide  some  mechanisms 
for achieving universal authentication. Without authen­
tication,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  assure  that  the  data 
ﬂow  produced  by  a  certain  entity  contains  what  it  is 
supposed to contain. Another important aspect related 
to  authentication  is  authorization.  If  there  is  no  access 
control  whatsoever,  everything  will  be  accessed  by 
everyone, which is neither viable nor realistic. 

•  In fact, the data deluge caused by billions of entities cre­
ating information is a big threat to privacy. Users must 
have tools that allow them to retain their anonymity in 
this superconnected world. Other tools must provide a 
snapshot  of  the  information  and  policies  surrounding 
a particular user, enabling transparency and preventing 
the notion that the IoT is silently controlling our lives. 
In fact, the IoT itself must seriously consider the imple­
mentation of the privacy by design principles [24], pro­
viding  user-centric  support  for  security  and  privacy 
from its very own foundations. 

•  The  size  and  heterogeneity  of  the  IoT  also  affects  its 
trust  and  governance.  There  are  actually  two  dimen­
sions of trust: (a) trust in the interaction between enti­
ties, where we have to deal with uncertainty about the 
future actions of all collaborating entities, and (b) trust 
in  the  system  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  user,  as 
users must be able to manage their things so as to not 
feel  under  some  unknown  external  control.  Regarding 
governance,  it  is  a  double-edged  sword  that  must  be 
wielded with care. On the  one hand, it offers  stability, 
support  for  political  decisions,  and  the  possibility  to 
deﬁne common frameworks and interoperability mech­
anisms.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily 
become  excessive, 
fostering  an  over-controlled 
environment. 

•  The number of vulnerable systems and attacks vectors 
will surely increase in the context of the IoT, thus fault 
tolerance  becomes  essential.  Not  only  we  must  strive 
for  security  by  default  (robust  implementations,  usable 
systems,  etc.)  in  the  IoT,  but  also  we  need  to  develop 

awareness  mechanisms  that  can  be  used  to  create  the 
foundations of intrusion detection and prevention mecha­
nisms,  which  will  help  IoT  entities  to  protect  or  even 
gracefully  degrade  their  services.  Finally,  recovery  ser­
vices  must  be  able  to  locate  unsafe  zones  (i.e.  zones 
affected  by  attacks)  and  redirect  the  functionality  of 
the systems to other trusted zones. 

3.2. Analysis of attacker models and threats 

As aforementioned, in order to understand how the dif­
ferent  approaches  presented  in  Section  2.2  should  be  se­
cured  in  the  future,  it  is  ﬁrstly  necessary  to  enumerate 
and analyze the attacker models. These models have been 
deﬁned in a way that they can be applied to both central­
ized  and  distributed  IoT  approaches.  Note,  however,  that 
the  concept  of  ‘perimeter’  in  the  Internet  of  Things  is  a 
bit  fuzzy:  an  attacker  can  control  part  of  the  network, 
but due to the inherent distributed nature of the IoT, it is 
nearly impossible for an attacker to fully control the whole 
system. As a result, an attacker can be both ‘internal’ and 
‘external’ at the same time. These attacker models, catego­
rized by threats, are introduced in the following paragraph. 

•  Denial  of  service  (DoS).  There are a wide number of DoS 
attacks that can be launched against the IoT. Beyond tradi­
tional Internet DoS attacks that exhaust service provider 
resources  and  network  bandwidth,  the  actual  wireless 
communication  infrastructure  of  most  data  acquisition 
networks can also be targeted (e.g. jamming the channels). 
Malicious internal attackers that take control of part of the 
infrastructure can create even more mayhem. 

•  Physical damage. This threat can be seen as a subset of 
the DoS threat. In this attacker model, active attackers 
usually lack  technical  knowledge, and  can  only hinder 
the provisioning of IoT services by destroying the actual 
‘things’.  This  is  a  realistic  attack  in  the  IoT  context, 
because  things  might  be  easily  accessible  to  anyone 
(e.g.  a  street  light).  If  that  is  not  possible,  the  attacker 
can simply target the hardware module in charge of cre­
ating the ‘virtual persona’ of the thing. 

•  Eavesdropping. Passive attackers can target various com­
munication channels (e.g. wireless networks, local wired 
networks,  Internet)  in  order  to  extract  data  from  the 
information  ﬂow.  Obviously,  an  internal  attacker  that 
gains  access  to  a  particular  infrastructure  will  be  able 
to  extract  the  information  that  circulates  within  that 
infrastructure. 

•  Node Capture. As aforementioned, things (e.g. household 
appliances, street lights) are physically located in a cer­
tain environment. Instead of destroying them, an active 
attacker can try to extract the information they contain. 
Note  also  that,  instead  of  things,  active  attackers  can 
also target other infrastructures that store information, 
such as data processing or data storage entities. 

•  Controlling.  As  long  as  there  is  an  attack  path,  active 
attackers can try to gain partial or full control over an 
IoT  entity.  The  scope  of  the  damage  caused  by  these 
attackers depends mainly on (a) the importance of the 
data managed by that particular entity, (b) the services 
that are provided by that particular entity.

While  both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches 
share  the  same  attacker  models,  there  are  subtle  differ­
ences caused by the distributed IoT features and principles. 
They change various aspects of the underlying infrastruc­
tures,  such  as  the  deployment  strategies  of  the  different 
IoT entities, the actual information ﬂow, and the availabil­
ity of certain interfaces and services. Such changes can cre­
ate  new  threats  and  facilitate  the  work  of  attackers,  but 
also can reduce the effectiveness of certain attack vectors. 
In  the  following  paragraphs  we  will  discuss  the  different 
aspects that are inﬂuenced by the distributed IoT features 
and  principles,  and  how  they  impact  the  threats  and  at­
tacker models. 

One aspect is the centralization of resources. Most adver­
saries will aim to target systems that provide the biggest 
payoff, and central entities fall under this category – they 
store, manage, and process a huge amount of information. 
Theoretically, these central entities will have better protec­
tion  mechanisms,  but  any  vulnerability  can  make  the 
whole  system  fall  apart.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  actual 
intelligence  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  distributed,  the 
information will be created and processed in different enti­
ties, thus adversaries need to redouble their efforts in order 
to control the same amount of resources. However, the dis­
tribution  of  resources  is  a  double-edged  sword.  If  the 
adversary is only interested in a speciﬁc piece of informa­
tion, it can target the system that manages that particular 
information – which might not be as protected as a central 
entity. Besides, node capture attacks become more danger­
ous, as more logic is placed within the things themselves. 
In  fact,  an  adversary  can  use  a  guerrilla  warfare  strategy 
and  gradually  take  control  of  small  parts  of  the  network, 
so as to affect the whole system in a covert way. 

Another aspect, related to the centralization of resources, 
is  the  nature  of  the  information  ﬂow.  In  centralized  IoT 
deployments, the information ﬂow will follow a hierarchical 
pattern,  as  a  central  entity  will  receive  information  from 
every  ‘thing’.  On  the  other  hand,  in  more  distributed  ap­
proaches, the information ﬂow will resemble a peer-to-peer 
system, where information is only exchanged when needed. 
In  this  particular case, an  adversary  that  eavesdrops  on  a 
section of the network will not be able to obtain a holistic 
point of view of the whole system. There is a caveat here: 
if an adversary targets an intranet of things (e.g. an IoT-en­
abled hospital) in a distributed scenario, he might be able 
to retrieve processed information instead of raw data. 

Regarding the overall connectivity of the network, in ap­
proaches  that  follow  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  con­
strained entities are expected to be directly locatable and 
addressable via the Internet. Therefore, they must be able 
to accept connections from external entities. This situation 
allows  malicious  adversaries  to  launch  attacks  that  can 
easily exhaust their resources. Observe that this situation 
can  also  arise  in  networks  (either  centralized  or  distrib­
uted)  with  actuators  (e.g.  electric  motors,  industrial 
machinery), as the behavior of actuators can change when 
receiving  orders  from  remote  administrators.  Note  also 
that  it  is  possible  to  implement  additional  protection 
mechanisms  to  control  these  incoming  connections,  such 
as ﬁrewalls and additional middleware layers. 

Finally, we also have to consider the user involvement in 
the conﬁguration of the security mechanisms. User-centric 
networks, such as personal area networks [18], are one of 
the  elements  of  the  Internet  of  Things.  By  pushing  the 
intelligence  onto  the  edge  of  the  network,  it  is  possible 
for  the  owners  of  these  networks  to  create  and  manage 
their  own  policies  (cf.  Section  3.3.4).  However,  as  most 
users are not experts, mistakes will happen if the security 
mechanisms  are  not  usable  enough.  Such  misconﬁgura­
tions  can  be  exploited  by  malicious  adversaries  to  access 
personal data or even take control of that particular user-
centric network. Note that in centralized entities the con­
ﬁguration of the security mechanisms will be made by ex­
perts,  but  any  misconﬁguration  will  create  a  very 
rewarding  window  of  opportunity  that  can  be  exploited 
by any knowledgeable adversary. 

By  reviewing  these  attacker  models,  we  can  conclude 
that no approach is better in terms of threats and attacker 
models – all  of  them have  various advantages and disad­
vantages.  In  a  centralized  IoT  the  central  entity  becomes 
a single point of failure; and although the number of attack 
vectors are smaller (and the protection mechanisms might 
be better), a single vulnerability or a misconﬁguration can 
cause  extreme  damage  to  the  whole  network.  If  the  re­
sources of the network are distributed, the impact caused 
by a successful attack will be smaller, but the number of at­
tack vectors will increase. Note that in all approaches there 
will  be  a  huge  number  of  data  providers, the  things,  that 
can  be  highly  constrained  and  physically  accessible  –  in 
other  words,  easy  targets.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  any 
IoT application will have to deal with a certain amount of 
bogus data. 

3.3. Speciﬁc challenges and promising solutions 

Once the analysis of the threats and attacker models is 
ﬁnished, we can study what are the main challenges in the 
design and deployment of the security mechanisms. Such 
study,  which  will  be  performed  in  the  next  sections,  will 
help  to  point  out  speciﬁc  problems  that  must  be  consid­
ered if we want to bring the distributed IoT architectures 
to the real world. Moreover, within this study, we will ex­
plore not only existing IoT security mechanisms,  but also 
promising approaches that could be used to provide secu­
rity in a distributed IoT environment. 

3.3.1. Identity and authentication 

It  is  essential  to  consider  how  to  manage  identity and 
authentication in the Internet of Things, as multiple enti­
ties (e.g. data sources, service providers, information pro­
cessing systems) need to authenticate each other in order 
to create trustable services [25]. When deﬁning these secu­
rity  mechanisms,  we  also  have  to  consider  some  of  the 
inherent features of the Internet of Things. As interactions 
can  be  quite  dynamic,  the  entities  of  the  network  might 
not even know in advance which partners can be used to 
create  a  certain  service.  Vehicular  networks  (VANETs 
[26]) are an example of this: cars are expected to provide 
data  not  only  to  devices  located  on  the  roadside  but  also 
to other cars. Besides, if billions of things are going to be

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

into the Internet of Things, have been already enumerated 
by the research community [3,22,23]. They are as follows: 

•  Heterogeneity  has  a  great  inﬂuence  over  the  protocol 
and  network  security  services  that  must  be  imple­
mented  in  the  IoT.  Constrained  devices  will  interact 
with  various  heterogeneous  devices  (e.g.  other  con­
strained  devices,  full-ﬂedged  web  servers)  either 
directly or through gateways. In this scenario, not only 
it is essential to implement efﬁcient cryptographic algo­
rithms that can provide a high throughput even in 8-bit 
or 16-bit devices, but also to adapt or create lightweight 
security protocols that offer an end-to-end secure com­
munication  channel.  These  protocols  require  creden­
tials,  thus  optimal  key  management  systems  must  be 
implemented to distribute these credentials and to help 
in  establishing  the  necessary  session  keys  between 
peers. 

•  The existence of billions of heterogeneous objects also 
affects  identity  management.  Beyond  deﬁning  the 
actual scope of ‘identity’ in this context (e.g. underlying 
identity  vs.  real  identity,  core  identity  vs.  temporary 
identity),  we  also  need  to  provide  some  mechanisms 
for achieving universal authentication. Without authen­
tication,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  assure  that  the  data 
ﬂow  produced  by  a  certain  entity  contains  what  it  is 
supposed to contain. Another important aspect related 
to  authentication  is  authorization.  If  there  is  no  access 
control  whatsoever,  everything  will  be  accessed  by 
everyone, which is neither viable nor realistic. 

•  In fact, the data deluge caused by billions of entities cre­
ating information is a big threat to privacy. Users must 
have tools that allow them to retain their anonymity in 
this superconnected world. Other tools must provide a 
snapshot  of  the  information  and  policies  surrounding 
a particular user, enabling transparency and preventing 
the notion that the IoT is silently controlling our lives. 
In fact, the IoT itself must seriously consider the imple­
mentation of the privacy by design principles [24], pro­
viding  user-centric  support  for  security  and  privacy 
from its very own foundations. 

•  The  size  and  heterogeneity  of  the  IoT  also  affects  its 
trust  and  governance.  There  are  actually  two  dimen­
sions of trust: (a) trust in the interaction between enti­
ties, where we have to deal with uncertainty about the 
future actions of all collaborating entities, and (b) trust 
in  the  system  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  user,  as 
users must be able to manage their things so as to not 
feel  under  some  unknown  external  control.  Regarding 
governance,  it  is  a  double-edged  sword  that  must  be 
wielded with care. On the  one hand, it offers  stability, 
support  for  political  decisions,  and  the  possibility  to 
deﬁne common frameworks and interoperability mech­
anisms.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily 
become  excessive, 
fostering  an  over-controlled 
environment. 

•  The number of vulnerable systems and attacks vectors 
will surely increase in the context of the IoT, thus fault 
tolerance  becomes  essential.  Not  only  we  must  strive 
for  security  by  default  (robust  implementations,  usable 
systems,  etc.)  in  the  IoT,  but  also  we  need  to  develop 

awareness  mechanisms  that  can  be  used  to  create  the 
foundations of intrusion detection and prevention mecha­
nisms,  which  will  help  IoT  entities  to  protect  or  even 
gracefully  degrade  their  services.  Finally,  recovery  ser­
vices  must  be  able  to  locate  unsafe  zones  (i.e.  zones 
affected  by  attacks)  and  redirect  the  functionality  of 
the systems to other trusted zones. 

3.2. Analysis of attacker models and threats 

As aforementioned, in order to understand how the dif­
ferent  approaches  presented  in  Section  2.2  should  be  se­
cured  in  the  future,  it  is  ﬁrstly  necessary  to  enumerate 
and analyze the attacker models. These models have been 
deﬁned in a way that they can be applied to both central­
ized  and  distributed  IoT  approaches.  Note,  however,  that 
the  concept  of  ‘perimeter’  in  the  Internet  of  Things  is  a 
bit  fuzzy:  an  attacker  can  control  part  of  the  network, 
but due to the inherent distributed nature of the IoT, it is 
nearly impossible for an attacker to fully control the whole 
system. As a result, an attacker can be both ‘internal’ and 
‘external’ at the same time. These attacker models, catego­
rized by threats, are introduced in the following paragraph. 

•  Denial  of  service  (DoS).  There are a wide number of DoS 
attacks that can be launched against the IoT. Beyond tradi­
tional Internet DoS attacks that exhaust service provider 
resources  and  network  bandwidth,  the  actual  wireless 
communication  infrastructure  of  most  data  acquisition 
networks can also be targeted (e.g. jamming the channels). 
Malicious internal attackers that take control of part of the 
infrastructure can create even more mayhem. 

•  Physical damage. This threat can be seen as a subset of 
the DoS threat. In this attacker model, active attackers 
usually lack  technical  knowledge, and  can  only hinder 
the provisioning of IoT services by destroying the actual 
‘things’.  This  is  a  realistic  attack  in  the  IoT  context, 
because  things  might  be  easily  accessible  to  anyone 
(e.g.  a  street  light).  If  that  is  not  possible,  the  attacker 
can simply target the hardware module in charge of cre­
ating the ‘virtual persona’ of the thing. 

•  Eavesdropping. Passive attackers can target various com­
munication channels (e.g. wireless networks, local wired 
networks,  Internet)  in  order  to  extract  data  from  the 
information  ﬂow.  Obviously,  an  internal  attacker  that 
gains  access  to  a  particular  infrastructure  will  be  able 
to  extract  the  information  that  circulates  within  that 
infrastructure. 

•  Node Capture. As aforementioned, things (e.g. household 
appliances, street lights) are physically located in a cer­
tain environment. Instead of destroying them, an active 
attacker can try to extract the information they contain. 
Note  also  that,  instead  of  things,  active  attackers  can 
also target other infrastructures that store information, 
such as data processing or data storage entities. 

•  Controlling.  As  long  as  there  is  an  attack  path,  active 
attackers can try to gain partial or full control over an 
IoT  entity.  The  scope  of  the  damage  caused  by  these 
attackers depends mainly on (a) the importance of the 
data managed by that particular entity, (b) the services 
that are provided by that particular entity.

While  both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches 
share  the  same  attacker  models,  there  are  subtle  differ­
ences caused by the distributed IoT features and principles. 
They change various aspects of the underlying infrastruc­
tures,  such  as  the  deployment  strategies  of  the  different 
IoT entities, the actual information ﬂow, and the availabil­
ity of certain interfaces and services. Such changes can cre­
ate  new  threats  and  facilitate  the  work  of  attackers,  but 
also can reduce the effectiveness of certain attack vectors. 
In  the  following  paragraphs  we  will  discuss  the  different 
aspects that are inﬂuenced by the distributed IoT features 
and  principles,  and  how  they  impact  the  threats  and  at­
tacker models. 

One aspect is the centralization of resources. Most adver­
saries will aim to target systems that provide the biggest 
payoff, and central entities fall under this category – they 
store, manage, and process a huge amount of information. 
Theoretically, these central entities will have better protec­
tion  mechanisms,  but  any  vulnerability  can  make  the 
whole  system  fall  apart.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  actual 
intelligence  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  distributed,  the 
information will be created and processed in different enti­
ties, thus adversaries need to redouble their efforts in order 
to control the same amount of resources. However, the dis­
tribution  of  resources  is  a  double-edged  sword.  If  the 
adversary is only interested in a speciﬁc piece of informa­
tion, it can target the system that manages that particular 
information – which might not be as protected as a central 
entity. Besides, node capture attacks become more danger­
ous, as more logic is placed within the things themselves. 
In  fact,  an  adversary  can  use  a  guerrilla  warfare  strategy 
and  gradually  take  control  of  small  parts  of  the  network, 
so as to affect the whole system in a covert way. 

Another aspect, related to the centralization of resources, 
is  the  nature  of  the  information  ﬂow.  In  centralized  IoT 
deployments, the information ﬂow will follow a hierarchical 
pattern,  as  a  central  entity  will  receive  information  from 
every  ‘thing’.  On  the  other  hand,  in  more  distributed  ap­
proaches, the information ﬂow will resemble a peer-to-peer 
system, where information is only exchanged when needed. 
In  this  particular case, an  adversary  that  eavesdrops  on  a 
section of the network will not be able to obtain a holistic 
point of view of the whole system. There is a caveat here: 
if an adversary targets an intranet of things (e.g. an IoT-en­
abled hospital) in a distributed scenario, he might be able 
to retrieve processed information instead of raw data. 

Regarding the overall connectivity of the network, in ap­
proaches  that  follow  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  con­
strained entities are expected to be directly locatable and 
addressable via the Internet. Therefore, they must be able 
to accept connections from external entities. This situation 
allows  malicious  adversaries  to  launch  attacks  that  can 
easily exhaust their resources. Observe that this situation 
can  also  arise  in  networks  (either  centralized  or  distrib­
uted)  with  actuators  (e.g.  electric  motors,  industrial 
machinery), as the behavior of actuators can change when 
receiving  orders  from  remote  administrators.  Note  also 
that  it  is  possible  to  implement  additional  protection 
mechanisms  to  control  these  incoming  connections,  such 
as ﬁrewalls and additional middleware layers. 

Finally, we also have to consider the user involvement in 
the conﬁguration of the security mechanisms. User-centric 
networks, such as personal area networks [18], are one of 
the  elements  of  the  Internet  of  Things.  By  pushing  the 
intelligence  onto  the  edge  of  the  network,  it  is  possible 
for  the  owners  of  these  networks  to  create  and  manage 
their  own  policies  (cf.  Section  3.3.4).  However,  as  most 
users are not experts, mistakes will happen if the security 
mechanisms  are  not  usable  enough.  Such  misconﬁgura­
tions  can  be  exploited  by  malicious  adversaries  to  access 
personal data or even take control of that particular user-
centric network. Note that in centralized entities the con­
ﬁguration of the security mechanisms will be made by ex­
perts,  but  any  misconﬁguration  will  create  a  very 
rewarding  window  of  opportunity  that  can  be  exploited 
by any knowledgeable adversary. 

By  reviewing  these  attacker  models,  we  can  conclude 
that no approach is better in terms of threats and attacker 
models – all  of  them have  various advantages and disad­
vantages.  In  a  centralized  IoT  the  central  entity  becomes 
a single point of failure; and although the number of attack 
vectors are smaller (and the protection mechanisms might 
be better), a single vulnerability or a misconﬁguration can 
cause  extreme  damage  to  the  whole  network.  If  the  re­
sources of the network are distributed, the impact caused 
by a successful attack will be smaller, but the number of at­
tack vectors will increase. Note that in all approaches there 
will  be  a  huge  number  of  data  providers, the  things,  that 
can  be  highly  constrained  and  physically  accessible  –  in 
other  words,  easy  targets.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  any 
IoT application will have to deal with a certain amount of 
bogus data. 

3.3. Speciﬁc challenges and promising solutions 

Once the analysis of the threats and attacker models is 
ﬁnished, we can study what are the main challenges in the 
design and deployment of the security mechanisms. Such 
study,  which  will  be  performed  in  the  next  sections,  will 
help  to  point  out  speciﬁc  problems  that  must  be  consid­
ered if we want to bring the distributed IoT architectures 
to the real world. Moreover, within this study, we will ex­
plore not only existing IoT security mechanisms,  but also 
promising approaches that could be used to provide secu­
rity in a distributed IoT environment. 

3.3.1. Identity and authentication 

It  is  essential  to  consider  how  to  manage  identity and 
authentication in the Internet of Things, as multiple enti­
ties (e.g. data sources, service providers, information pro­
cessing systems) need to authenticate each other in order 
to create trustable services [25]. When deﬁning these secu­
rity  mechanisms,  we  also  have  to  consider  some  of  the 
inherent features of the Internet of Things. As interactions 
can  be  quite  dynamic,  the  entities  of  the  network  might 
not even know in advance which partners can be used to 
create  a  certain  service.  Vehicular  networks  (VANETs 
[26]) are an example of this: cars are expected to provide 
data  not  only  to  devices  located  on  the  roadside  but  also 
to other cars. Besides, if billions of things are going to be

interconnected, it is necessary to manage their identities in 
a scalable way. 

In a centralized IoT architecture, some of these challenges 
are inherently more simple. In this particular approach, the 
application  logic  is  mainly  located  in  one  central  entity 
(e.g. a cloud-based IoT application platform) that provides 
a  limited  set  of  well-known entry  points  (e.g.  APIs).  Both 
data providers, such as sensors, and information consum­
ers, such as user applications and other customers, connect 
to this central entity. As a consequence, all the authentica­
tion logic can be centralized in this entity or in an identity 
provider associated with it. In case there are data providers 
that have their own identity provider, there are no scalabil­
ity  problems,  as  such  identity  providers  can  establish  a 
relationship of trust with the central entity (a N-to-1 sce­
nario). Note that if an IoT complies with the collaboration 
principle (Collaborative IoT), it might be possible to make 
use  of  a  federated  identity  management  system,  where 
all the service providers belong to the same circle of trust. 
This simpliﬁcation cannot be found in purely distributed 
IoT  architectures,  which  fulﬁll  both  the  collaboration  and 
edge intelligence principles. In  this context  we ﬁnd  a dy­
namic N-to-N scenario, where data providers are no longer 
passive  and  are  able  to  acquire  and  process  information 
from other sources. Moreover, due to the edge intelligence 
principle, local users can query local information providers 
directly, without intervention from external entities. As a 
result, some kind of authentication logic must be present 
in every service provider – including the tiniest of objects. 
Note, however, that things do not exist in a vacuum: they 
usually belong to a speciﬁc group, are located in a particu­
lar  context,  and  are  owned  by  certain  entities.  These  as­
pects must be taken into account. 

3.3.1.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  aforementioned,  it  is 
essential to  manage  the  identities  of  the  things in  a  scal­
able  way.  However,  as  of  2012,  there  are  various  mecha­
nisms  that  can  be  used  to  identify  things  uniquely,  such 
as  the  tag  code  standards  EPC  and  ucode  [27].  Therefore, 
it is expected that in the future various systems will coex­
ist – not only at the universal level but also at a local scale 
[28].  Note,  however,  that  in  many  scenarios  the  ‘who’  is 
less important than the ‘where’ and the ‘what’. As a conse­
quence, things should be able to identify themselves using 
their  attributes  and  their  context  (e.g.  radiation  sensor 
#2044A can simply state that is a radiation sensor located 
in Shibuya, Tokyo). 

Regarding  things  authentication,  we  have  to  consider 
that  in  many  scenarios  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(e.g. intranets of things, personal area networks) located in 
the same spatial area (e.g. IoT-enabled hospitals). In such 
environments, local identity providers can manage the iden­
tities of those things, and also can create a circle of trust with 
relevant external resource providers (e.g. the household of a 
chronic patient, other hospitals). Consequently, local enti­
ties are not only able to authenticate to each other within 
the  group,  but  also  can  provide  a  proof  of  identity  when 
interacting  with  external  entities.  Also,  external  entities 
can  receive  a  temporary  persona  (e.g.  long-term  patient) 
from  the  local  identity  provider  if  necessary.  This  group-
based strategy has been, in fact, partially considered in the 

interactions between WSN islands, where interdomain col­
laboration is possible through federated identity manage­
ment and  access  tokens translation [29].  Traditional Web 
2.0 SSO such as OpenID and Shibboleth could also be used 
in this situation, although it should be noted that they were 
not designed to fulﬁll certain IoT requirements such as iden­
tity disclosure (i.e. support for privacy) [30], thus more anal­
yses are needed. 

If the thing is actually a human being, it can also be pos­
sible to use existing authentication mechanisms (e.g. web 
credentials,  electronic  identity  cards)  if  the  resource  pro­
vider  understands  them.  For  example,  Guinard  et  al.  [31] 
proposed  a  smart  gateway  infrastructure  (Social  Access 
Controller, or SAC) that allows users to retrieve data from 
local sensors using their social network (e.g. Facebook) cre­
dentials.  Note  that  this  approach  might  not  work  in  case 
the  human  being  does  not  directly  interact  with  the  IoT 
entities. In such cases, it is necessary to develop surrogate 
mechanisms  that  can  act  on  behalf  of  the  human  users. 
One existing example is the concept of the Minimal Entity 
(ME) [32] – a device that stores the digital identity of the 
user  and  acts  as  his  representative  in  the  virtual  world. 
Not only it does provide end-to-end secure communication 
and  collaboration  with  anonymous  receivers,  but  also  al­
lows  the  implementation  of  pseudonyms.  Another  exam­
ple  is  the  concept  of  a  digital  shadow  [33],  where  users 
can  delegate  their  credentials  (including  access  control 
credentials) to multiple objects or virtual entities. 

3.3.2. Access control 

In the Internet of Things, the challenges related to Access 
Control are closely related to those found in any distributed 
system. A particular service is constructed by aggregating 
several services and data sources from different locations 
and  contexts  (e.g.  a  hospital  retrieving  information  from 
home patients and ambulances). All these information pro­
viders will have their own access control policies and per­
missions  whose 
(creation,  enforcement, 
maintenance, translation) needs to be managed. 

life  cycle 

There are also some speciﬁc issues that must be taken 
into account in the context of the IoT. Granularity (i.e. pro­
viding more information to people with the right creden­
tials)  and  location  (i.e.  checking  whether  users  are 
accessing  the  services  of  a  thing  locally  or  remotely)  be­
come important elements of the access control policies in 
certain  scenarios.  For  example,  in  case  of  an  accident, 
everyone at the crash site can access my blood group, but 
only certiﬁed doctors and nurses can access my vital signs. 
Also,  whenever  access  control  mechanisms  are  imple­
mented  at  the  thing  level,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the 
amount  of  computational  resources  that  are  available,  as 
constrained  devices  might  not  have  enough  space  to 
implement  a  complex  access  control  mechanism.  Finally, 
as  many  things  are  owned  by  their  users  (either  perma­
nently or temporarily) and may belong to a group (e.g. per­
sonal area network), it is necessary to consider the design 
of delegation mechanisms, as these things may act in the 
name of the user/group. 

As with authentication, access control policies are eas­
ier to manage in centralized IoT architectures: all access con­
trol policies are stored and managed within a single central

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

deployments. The purpose of this paper is to assess and an­
swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

into the Internet of Things, have been already enumerated 
by the research community [3,22,23]. They are as follows: 

•  Heterogeneity  has  a  great  inﬂuence  over  the  protocol 
and  network  security  services  that  must  be  imple­
mented  in  the  IoT.  Constrained  devices  will  interact 
with  various  heterogeneous  devices  (e.g.  other  con­
strained  devices,  full-ﬂedged  web  servers)  either 
directly or through gateways. In this scenario, not only 
it is essential to implement efﬁcient cryptographic algo­
rithms that can provide a high throughput even in 8-bit 
or 16-bit devices, but also to adapt or create lightweight 
security protocols that offer an end-to-end secure com­
munication  channel.  These  protocols  require  creden­
tials,  thus  optimal  key  management  systems  must  be 
implemented to distribute these credentials and to help 
in  establishing  the  necessary  session  keys  between 
peers. 

•  The existence of billions of heterogeneous objects also 
affects  identity  management.  Beyond  deﬁning  the 
actual scope of ‘identity’ in this context (e.g. underlying 
identity  vs.  real  identity,  core  identity  vs.  temporary 
identity),  we  also  need  to  provide  some  mechanisms 
for achieving universal authentication. Without authen­
tication,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  assure  that  the  data 
ﬂow  produced  by  a  certain  entity  contains  what  it  is 
supposed to contain. Another important aspect related 
to  authentication  is  authorization.  If  there  is  no  access 
control  whatsoever,  everything  will  be  accessed  by 
everyone, which is neither viable nor realistic. 

•  In fact, the data deluge caused by billions of entities cre­
ating information is a big threat to privacy. Users must 
have tools that allow them to retain their anonymity in 
this superconnected world. Other tools must provide a 
snapshot  of  the  information  and  policies  surrounding 
a particular user, enabling transparency and preventing 
the notion that the IoT is silently controlling our lives. 
In fact, the IoT itself must seriously consider the imple­
mentation of the privacy by design principles [24], pro­
viding  user-centric  support  for  security  and  privacy 
from its very own foundations. 

•  The  size  and  heterogeneity  of  the  IoT  also  affects  its 
trust  and  governance.  There  are  actually  two  dimen­
sions of trust: (a) trust in the interaction between enti­
ties, where we have to deal with uncertainty about the 
future actions of all collaborating entities, and (b) trust 
in  the  system  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  user,  as 
users must be able to manage their things so as to not 
feel  under  some  unknown  external  control.  Regarding 
governance,  it  is  a  double-edged  sword  that  must  be 
wielded with care. On the  one hand, it offers  stability, 
support  for  political  decisions,  and  the  possibility  to 
deﬁne common frameworks and interoperability mech­
anisms.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily 
become  excessive, 
fostering  an  over-controlled 
environment. 

•  The number of vulnerable systems and attacks vectors 
will surely increase in the context of the IoT, thus fault 
tolerance  becomes  essential.  Not  only  we  must  strive 
for  security  by  default  (robust  implementations,  usable 
systems,  etc.)  in  the  IoT,  but  also  we  need  to  develop 

awareness  mechanisms  that  can  be  used  to  create  the 
foundations of intrusion detection and prevention mecha­
nisms,  which  will  help  IoT  entities  to  protect  or  even 
gracefully  degrade  their  services.  Finally,  recovery  ser­
vices  must  be  able  to  locate  unsafe  zones  (i.e.  zones 
affected  by  attacks)  and  redirect  the  functionality  of 
the systems to other trusted zones. 

3.2. Analysis of attacker models and threats 

As aforementioned, in order to understand how the dif­
ferent  approaches  presented  in  Section  2.2  should  be  se­
cured  in  the  future,  it  is  ﬁrstly  necessary  to  enumerate 
and analyze the attacker models. These models have been 
deﬁned in a way that they can be applied to both central­
ized  and  distributed  IoT  approaches.  Note,  however,  that 
the  concept  of  ‘perimeter’  in  the  Internet  of  Things  is  a 
bit  fuzzy:  an  attacker  can  control  part  of  the  network, 
but due to the inherent distributed nature of the IoT, it is 
nearly impossible for an attacker to fully control the whole 
system. As a result, an attacker can be both ‘internal’ and 
‘external’ at the same time. These attacker models, catego­
rized by threats, are introduced in the following paragraph. 

•  Denial  of  service  (DoS).  There are a wide number of DoS 
attacks that can be launched against the IoT. Beyond tradi­
tional Internet DoS attacks that exhaust service provider 
resources  and  network  bandwidth,  the  actual  wireless 
communication  infrastructure  of  most  data  acquisition 
networks can also be targeted (e.g. jamming the channels). 
Malicious internal attackers that take control of part of the 
infrastructure can create even more mayhem. 

•  Physical damage. This threat can be seen as a subset of 
the DoS threat. In this attacker model, active attackers 
usually lack  technical  knowledge, and  can  only hinder 
the provisioning of IoT services by destroying the actual 
‘things’.  This  is  a  realistic  attack  in  the  IoT  context, 
because  things  might  be  easily  accessible  to  anyone 
(e.g.  a  street  light).  If  that  is  not  possible,  the  attacker 
can simply target the hardware module in charge of cre­
ating the ‘virtual persona’ of the thing. 

•  Eavesdropping. Passive attackers can target various com­
munication channels (e.g. wireless networks, local wired 
networks,  Internet)  in  order  to  extract  data  from  the 
information  ﬂow.  Obviously,  an  internal  attacker  that 
gains  access  to  a  particular  infrastructure  will  be  able 
to  extract  the  information  that  circulates  within  that 
infrastructure. 

•  Node Capture. As aforementioned, things (e.g. household 
appliances, street lights) are physically located in a cer­
tain environment. Instead of destroying them, an active 
attacker can try to extract the information they contain. 
Note  also  that,  instead  of  things,  active  attackers  can 
also target other infrastructures that store information, 
such as data processing or data storage entities. 

•  Controlling.  As  long  as  there  is  an  attack  path,  active 
attackers can try to gain partial or full control over an 
IoT  entity.  The  scope  of  the  damage  caused  by  these 
attackers depends mainly on (a) the importance of the 
data managed by that particular entity, (b) the services 
that are provided by that particular entity.

While  both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches 
share  the  same  attacker  models,  there  are  subtle  differ­
ences caused by the distributed IoT features and principles. 
They change various aspects of the underlying infrastruc­
tures,  such  as  the  deployment  strategies  of  the  different 
IoT entities, the actual information ﬂow, and the availabil­
ity of certain interfaces and services. Such changes can cre­
ate  new  threats  and  facilitate  the  work  of  attackers,  but 
also can reduce the effectiveness of certain attack vectors. 
In  the  following  paragraphs  we  will  discuss  the  different 
aspects that are inﬂuenced by the distributed IoT features 
and  principles,  and  how  they  impact  the  threats  and  at­
tacker models. 

One aspect is the centralization of resources. Most adver­
saries will aim to target systems that provide the biggest 
payoff, and central entities fall under this category – they 
store, manage, and process a huge amount of information. 
Theoretically, these central entities will have better protec­
tion  mechanisms,  but  any  vulnerability  can  make  the 
whole  system  fall  apart.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  actual 
intelligence  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  distributed,  the 
information will be created and processed in different enti­
ties, thus adversaries need to redouble their efforts in order 
to control the same amount of resources. However, the dis­
tribution  of  resources  is  a  double-edged  sword.  If  the 
adversary is only interested in a speciﬁc piece of informa­
tion, it can target the system that manages that particular 
information – which might not be as protected as a central 
entity. Besides, node capture attacks become more danger­
ous, as more logic is placed within the things themselves. 
In  fact,  an  adversary  can  use  a  guerrilla  warfare  strategy 
and  gradually  take  control  of  small  parts  of  the  network, 
so as to affect the whole system in a covert way. 

Another aspect, related to the centralization of resources, 
is  the  nature  of  the  information  ﬂow.  In  centralized  IoT 
deployments, the information ﬂow will follow a hierarchical 
pattern,  as  a  central  entity  will  receive  information  from 
every  ‘thing’.  On  the  other  hand,  in  more  distributed  ap­
proaches, the information ﬂow will resemble a peer-to-peer 
system, where information is only exchanged when needed. 
In  this  particular case, an  adversary  that  eavesdrops  on  a 
section of the network will not be able to obtain a holistic 
point of view of the whole system. There is a caveat here: 
if an adversary targets an intranet of things (e.g. an IoT-en­
abled hospital) in a distributed scenario, he might be able 
to retrieve processed information instead of raw data. 

Regarding the overall connectivity of the network, in ap­
proaches  that  follow  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  con­
strained entities are expected to be directly locatable and 
addressable via the Internet. Therefore, they must be able 
to accept connections from external entities. This situation 
allows  malicious  adversaries  to  launch  attacks  that  can 
easily exhaust their resources. Observe that this situation 
can  also  arise  in  networks  (either  centralized  or  distrib­
uted)  with  actuators  (e.g.  electric  motors,  industrial 
machinery), as the behavior of actuators can change when 
receiving  orders  from  remote  administrators.  Note  also 
that  it  is  possible  to  implement  additional  protection 
mechanisms  to  control  these  incoming  connections,  such 
as ﬁrewalls and additional middleware layers. 

Finally, we also have to consider the user involvement in 
the conﬁguration of the security mechanisms. User-centric 
networks, such as personal area networks [18], are one of 
the  elements  of  the  Internet  of  Things.  By  pushing  the 
intelligence  onto  the  edge  of  the  network,  it  is  possible 
for  the  owners  of  these  networks  to  create  and  manage 
their  own  policies  (cf.  Section  3.3.4).  However,  as  most 
users are not experts, mistakes will happen if the security 
mechanisms  are  not  usable  enough.  Such  misconﬁgura­
tions  can  be  exploited  by  malicious  adversaries  to  access 
personal data or even take control of that particular user-
centric network. Note that in centralized entities the con­
ﬁguration of the security mechanisms will be made by ex­
perts,  but  any  misconﬁguration  will  create  a  very 
rewarding  window  of  opportunity  that  can  be  exploited 
by any knowledgeable adversary. 

By  reviewing  these  attacker  models,  we  can  conclude 
that no approach is better in terms of threats and attacker 
models – all  of  them have  various advantages and disad­
vantages.  In  a  centralized  IoT  the  central  entity  becomes 
a single point of failure; and although the number of attack 
vectors are smaller (and the protection mechanisms might 
be better), a single vulnerability or a misconﬁguration can 
cause  extreme  damage  to  the  whole  network.  If  the  re­
sources of the network are distributed, the impact caused 
by a successful attack will be smaller, but the number of at­
tack vectors will increase. Note that in all approaches there 
will  be  a  huge  number  of  data  providers, the  things,  that 
can  be  highly  constrained  and  physically  accessible  –  in 
other  words,  easy  targets.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  any 
IoT application will have to deal with a certain amount of 
bogus data. 

3.3. Speciﬁc challenges and promising solutions 

Once the analysis of the threats and attacker models is 
ﬁnished, we can study what are the main challenges in the 
design and deployment of the security mechanisms. Such 
study,  which  will  be  performed  in  the  next  sections,  will 
help  to  point  out  speciﬁc  problems  that  must  be  consid­
ered if we want to bring the distributed IoT architectures 
to the real world. Moreover, within this study, we will ex­
plore not only existing IoT security mechanisms,  but also 
promising approaches that could be used to provide secu­
rity in a distributed IoT environment. 

3.3.1. Identity and authentication 

It  is  essential  to  consider  how  to  manage  identity and 
authentication in the Internet of Things, as multiple enti­
ties (e.g. data sources, service providers, information pro­
cessing systems) need to authenticate each other in order 
to create trustable services [25]. When deﬁning these secu­
rity  mechanisms,  we  also  have  to  consider  some  of  the 
inherent features of the Internet of Things. As interactions 
can  be  quite  dynamic,  the  entities  of  the  network  might 
not even know in advance which partners can be used to 
create  a  certain  service.  Vehicular  networks  (VANETs 
[26]) are an example of this: cars are expected to provide 
data  not  only  to  devices  located  on  the  roadside  but  also 
to other cars. Besides, if billions of things are going to be

interconnected, it is necessary to manage their identities in 
a scalable way. 

In a centralized IoT architecture, some of these challenges 
are inherently more simple. In this particular approach, the 
application  logic  is  mainly  located  in  one  central  entity 
(e.g. a cloud-based IoT application platform) that provides 
a  limited  set  of  well-known entry  points  (e.g.  APIs).  Both 
data providers, such as sensors, and information consum­
ers, such as user applications and other customers, connect 
to this central entity. As a consequence, all the authentica­
tion logic can be centralized in this entity or in an identity 
provider associated with it. In case there are data providers 
that have their own identity provider, there are no scalabil­
ity  problems,  as  such  identity  providers  can  establish  a 
relationship of trust with the central entity (a N-to-1 sce­
nario). Note that if an IoT complies with the collaboration 
principle (Collaborative IoT), it might be possible to make 
use  of  a  federated  identity  management  system,  where 
all the service providers belong to the same circle of trust. 
This simpliﬁcation cannot be found in purely distributed 
IoT  architectures,  which  fulﬁll  both  the  collaboration  and 
edge intelligence principles. In  this context  we ﬁnd  a dy­
namic N-to-N scenario, where data providers are no longer 
passive  and  are  able  to  acquire  and  process  information 
from other sources. Moreover, due to the edge intelligence 
principle, local users can query local information providers 
directly, without intervention from external entities. As a 
result, some kind of authentication logic must be present 
in every service provider – including the tiniest of objects. 
Note, however, that things do not exist in a vacuum: they 
usually belong to a speciﬁc group, are located in a particu­
lar  context,  and  are  owned  by  certain  entities.  These  as­
pects must be taken into account. 

3.3.1.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  aforementioned,  it  is 
essential to  manage  the  identities  of  the  things in  a  scal­
able  way.  However,  as  of  2012,  there  are  various  mecha­
nisms  that  can  be  used  to  identify  things  uniquely,  such 
as  the  tag  code  standards  EPC  and  ucode  [27].  Therefore, 
it is expected that in the future various systems will coex­
ist – not only at the universal level but also at a local scale 
[28].  Note,  however,  that  in  many  scenarios  the  ‘who’  is 
less important than the ‘where’ and the ‘what’. As a conse­
quence, things should be able to identify themselves using 
their  attributes  and  their  context  (e.g.  radiation  sensor 
#2044A can simply state that is a radiation sensor located 
in Shibuya, Tokyo). 

Regarding  things  authentication,  we  have  to  consider 
that  in  many  scenarios  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(e.g. intranets of things, personal area networks) located in 
the same spatial area (e.g. IoT-enabled hospitals). In such 
environments, local identity providers can manage the iden­
tities of those things, and also can create a circle of trust with 
relevant external resource providers (e.g. the household of a 
chronic patient, other hospitals). Consequently, local enti­
ties are not only able to authenticate to each other within 
the  group,  but  also  can  provide  a  proof  of  identity  when 
interacting  with  external  entities.  Also,  external  entities 
can  receive  a  temporary  persona  (e.g.  long-term  patient) 
from  the  local  identity  provider  if  necessary.  This  group-
based strategy has been, in fact, partially considered in the 

interactions between WSN islands, where interdomain col­
laboration is possible through federated identity manage­
ment and  access  tokens translation [29].  Traditional Web 
2.0 SSO such as OpenID and Shibboleth could also be used 
in this situation, although it should be noted that they were 
not designed to fulﬁll certain IoT requirements such as iden­
tity disclosure (i.e. support for privacy) [30], thus more anal­
yses are needed. 

If the thing is actually a human being, it can also be pos­
sible to use existing authentication mechanisms (e.g. web 
credentials,  electronic  identity  cards)  if  the  resource  pro­
vider  understands  them.  For  example,  Guinard  et  al.  [31] 
proposed  a  smart  gateway  infrastructure  (Social  Access 
Controller, or SAC) that allows users to retrieve data from 
local sensors using their social network (e.g. Facebook) cre­
dentials.  Note  that  this  approach  might  not  work  in  case 
the  human  being  does  not  directly  interact  with  the  IoT 
entities. In such cases, it is necessary to develop surrogate 
mechanisms  that  can  act  on  behalf  of  the  human  users. 
One existing example is the concept of the Minimal Entity 
(ME) [32] – a device that stores the digital identity of the 
user  and  acts  as  his  representative  in  the  virtual  world. 
Not only it does provide end-to-end secure communication 
and  collaboration  with  anonymous  receivers,  but  also  al­
lows  the  implementation  of  pseudonyms.  Another  exam­
ple  is  the  concept  of  a  digital  shadow  [33],  where  users 
can  delegate  their  credentials  (including  access  control 
credentials) to multiple objects or virtual entities. 

3.3.2. Access control 

In the Internet of Things, the challenges related to Access 
Control are closely related to those found in any distributed 
system. A particular service is constructed by aggregating 
several services and data sources from different locations 
and  contexts  (e.g.  a  hospital  retrieving  information  from 
home patients and ambulances). All these information pro­
viders will have their own access control policies and per­
missions  whose 
(creation,  enforcement, 
maintenance, translation) needs to be managed. 

life  cycle 

There are also some speciﬁc issues that must be taken 
into account in the context of the IoT. Granularity (i.e. pro­
viding more information to people with the right creden­
tials)  and  location  (i.e.  checking  whether  users  are 
accessing  the  services  of  a  thing  locally  or  remotely)  be­
come important elements of the access control policies in 
certain  scenarios.  For  example,  in  case  of  an  accident, 
everyone at the crash site can access my blood group, but 
only certiﬁed doctors and nurses can access my vital signs. 
Also,  whenever  access  control  mechanisms  are  imple­
mented  at  the  thing  level,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the 
amount  of  computational  resources  that  are  available,  as 
constrained  devices  might  not  have  enough  space  to 
implement  a  complex  access  control  mechanism.  Finally, 
as  many  things  are  owned  by  their  users  (either  perma­
nently or temporarily) and may belong to a group (e.g. per­
sonal area network), it is necessary to consider the design 
of delegation mechanisms, as these things may act in the 
name of the user/group. 

As with authentication, access control policies are eas­
ier to manage in centralized IoT architectures: all access con­
trol policies are stored and managed within a single central

9 

entity. Therefore, data providers do not need to implement 
any kind of access control logic: they will send all their data 
to those whom they trust (i.e. the central entity). As a side 
effect of this conﬁguration, both data providers and infor­
mation consumers must completely trust the central entity, 
as  it  will  store  the  information  generated  by  all  network 
entities. On the other hand, purely distributed IoT architec­
tures have to deal with all previously mentioned challenges: 
management of heterogeneous policies, multiple enforce­
ment points, etc. Nevertheless, as will be mentioned in Sec­
tion 3.3.4, the overall privacy of the network improves once 
the things can control directly who accesses their own data. 
Observe  that  additional  mechanisms  must  be  imple­
mented  whenever  the  collaboration  principle  is  applied 
to centralized IoT architectures (e.g. tools for maintaining 
consistency between access control lists, resource delega­
tion  mechanisms).  Note  also  that  we  need  to  manually 
conﬁgure  the  direct  links  between  the  intranets  and  the 
external  entities  in  networks  that  only  comply  with  the 
edge intelligence principle. 

3.3.2.1. Promising approaches.  There have been very few ad­
vances  in  the  management  of  access  control  policies  for 
distributed IoTs. In fact, it is not trivial to apply existing ac­
cess control approaches to completely distributed environ­
ments.  For  example,  there  are  scalability  and  consistency 
issues  when  storing  the  list  of  users  and  their  associated 
access rights in access control lists (ACLs). Role-based ac­
cess control (RBAC) mechanisms need to deﬁne the differ­
ent roles that users can take, which might be different in 
various contexts even if they refer to the same type of en­
tity  (e.g. custodian vs. janitor).  Finally, RBAC policies that 
use attribute certiﬁcates [34] need of an infrastructure that 
allows validating such certiﬁcates in a cross-domain envi­
ronment. Note, however, that due to the speciﬁc features of 
the Internet of Things, it is possible to consider certain fac­
tors  such  as  context  as  part  of  the  access  control  model 
[35].  As a consequence, with adequate technological  sup­
port, certain policies (e.g. only authenticated users located 
within  my  vicinity  during  working  hours  can  access  to­
day’s reports) can be easily implemented. 

Besides,  there  are  various  simple  strategies  that  could 
be  used  whenever  the  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(cf.  Section  3.3.1).  For  example,  the  access  control  logic 
could  be  pushed  to  speciﬁc  trusted  entities,  which  will 
act as token-granting services à la Kerberos (i.e. a thing will 
grant access to anyone that has a valid signature created by 
a  trusted  entity).  In  another  approach,  the  access  control 
logic  can  be  implemented  within  the  things  themselves, 
but relying only on locally-deﬁned roles (e.g. a doctor from 
another  hospital  must  retrieve  his  locally-issued  role  be­
fore  interacting  with  the  local  things).  A  drawback  of  all 
these strategies is that users must ﬁrst access the trusted 
entity before requesting information from the things. 

3.3.3. Protocol and network security 

A  secure  communications  channel  is,  in  most  cases,  a 
byproduct  of  a  successful  authentication  (e.g.  server 
authentication  or  mutual  authentication  using  protocols 
such  as  TLS/DTLS).  This  process  will  make  use  of  certain 
user credentials, such as shared keys or X.509 certiﬁcates. 

If there is a limited set of well-known centralized applica­
tion  providers  (i.e.  central  entities),  the  distribution  and 
management  of  these  credentials  becomes  easier,  as  it  is 
possible  to  preload  information  in  the  devices.  However, 
in  distributed  IoT  architectures,  extra  challenges  arise:  any 
entity can connect with any other entity at any time, these 
entities  might  not  know  each  other  in  advance,  and  also 
limited devices can exchange information with other lim­
ited  devices.  Therefore,  in  this  scenario  key  management 
becomes a signiﬁcant problem. 

There are some additional challenges related to the com­
putational resources available to things. When opening a se­
cure channel, devices should be able to negotiate the actual 
parameters of that channel, such as algorithms (e.g. RSA vs. 
ECC), strength (AES-128 vs. AES-256), and protection mech­
anisms (only integrity vs. conﬁdentiality and integrity). The 
ﬁrst  reason  is  obvious:  constrained  devices  might  not  be 
able to implement certain conﬁgurations. There is another 
reason, though: adaptability. Depending on various factors 
such as the level of criticality of the data, it might not be nec­
essary to apply strong protection mechanisms to a particu­
lar  information  ﬂow  (e.g.  conﬁdentiality  and  the  on/off 
status of a street light). Another challenge is the need to ana­
lyze  the  number  of  security  protocols  that  can  be  imple­
mented within a constrained device. In fact, it is necessary 
to  carefully  study  whether  existing  Internet  protocols 
should be adapted to this context or not. Finally, things that 
can  be  accessed  directly  (e.g.  in  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach)  need  to  be  careful about  the  overhead caused by 
incoming connections (e.g. multiple incoming connections 
that require the use of public key cryptography). 

3.3.3.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  the  Internet  of  Things 
inhabits the Internet ecosystem, it is important to provide 
support for existing security protocols. In fact, the security 
of IoT-designed web transfer protocols, such as CoAP (Con­
strained Application Protocol), is largely dependant on the 
implementation of these security protocols [36]. Some pro­
tocols can be implemented without any major changes. For 
example, there are commercial implementations available 
of DTLS for constrained devices [37]. However, other proto­
cols need to be adapted due to the complexity of their de­
sign.  Such  protocols  must  achieve  a  tradeoff  between 
simplicity  and  compatibility.  For  example,  one  approach 
seeks  to  apply  IPsec  to  constrained  environments by  bal­
ancing  link-layer  security  and  IPsec  security  (cf.  Raza 
et al. [38]). 

As for the distribution of the credentials, there are var­
ious strategies that could be used to tackle this problem. As 
aforementioned  (cf.  Sections  3.3.1  and  3.3.2),  whenever 
things  belong  to  a  particular  local  group,  it  is  possible  to 
have one or various entities in charge of managing and dis­
tributing  the  credentials.  Also,  in  scenarios  where  clients 
and servers know each other in advance, it is also possible 
to  use  certain  symmetric  key-based  protocols,  which  can 
provide good properties such as high resilience to attacks 
[39].  Finally,  beyond  the  optimization  of  these  security 
protocols, there are various researchers that  are pursuing 
the  implementation  of  fast  and  compact  cryptographic 
algorithms.  There  are  various  research  areas,  which  are 
not  mutually  exclusive:  from  the  design  of  novel  hash

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

into the Internet of Things, have been already enumerated 
by the research community [3,22,23]. They are as follows: 

•  Heterogeneity  has  a  great  inﬂuence  over  the  protocol 
and  network  security  services  that  must  be  imple­
mented  in  the  IoT.  Constrained  devices  will  interact 
with  various  heterogeneous  devices  (e.g.  other  con­
strained  devices,  full-ﬂedged  web  servers)  either 
directly or through gateways. In this scenario, not only 
it is essential to implement efﬁcient cryptographic algo­
rithms that can provide a high throughput even in 8-bit 
or 16-bit devices, but also to adapt or create lightweight 
security protocols that offer an end-to-end secure com­
munication  channel.  These  protocols  require  creden­
tials,  thus  optimal  key  management  systems  must  be 
implemented to distribute these credentials and to help 
in  establishing  the  necessary  session  keys  between 
peers. 

•  The existence of billions of heterogeneous objects also 
affects  identity  management.  Beyond  deﬁning  the 
actual scope of ‘identity’ in this context (e.g. underlying 
identity  vs.  real  identity,  core  identity  vs.  temporary 
identity),  we  also  need  to  provide  some  mechanisms 
for achieving universal authentication. Without authen­
tication,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  assure  that  the  data 
ﬂow  produced  by  a  certain  entity  contains  what  it  is 
supposed to contain. Another important aspect related 
to  authentication  is  authorization.  If  there  is  no  access 
control  whatsoever,  everything  will  be  accessed  by 
everyone, which is neither viable nor realistic. 

•  In fact, the data deluge caused by billions of entities cre­
ating information is a big threat to privacy. Users must 
have tools that allow them to retain their anonymity in 
this superconnected world. Other tools must provide a 
snapshot  of  the  information  and  policies  surrounding 
a particular user, enabling transparency and preventing 
the notion that the IoT is silently controlling our lives. 
In fact, the IoT itself must seriously consider the imple­
mentation of the privacy by design principles [24], pro­
viding  user-centric  support  for  security  and  privacy 
from its very own foundations. 

•  The  size  and  heterogeneity  of  the  IoT  also  affects  its 
trust  and  governance.  There  are  actually  two  dimen­
sions of trust: (a) trust in the interaction between enti­
ties, where we have to deal with uncertainty about the 
future actions of all collaborating entities, and (b) trust 
in  the  system  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  user,  as 
users must be able to manage their things so as to not 
feel  under  some  unknown  external  control.  Regarding 
governance,  it  is  a  double-edged  sword  that  must  be 
wielded with care. On the  one hand, it offers  stability, 
support  for  political  decisions,  and  the  possibility  to 
deﬁne common frameworks and interoperability mech­
anisms.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily 
become  excessive, 
fostering  an  over-controlled 
environment. 

•  The number of vulnerable systems and attacks vectors 
will surely increase in the context of the IoT, thus fault 
tolerance  becomes  essential.  Not  only  we  must  strive 
for  security  by  default  (robust  implementations,  usable 
systems,  etc.)  in  the  IoT,  but  also  we  need  to  develop 

awareness  mechanisms  that  can  be  used  to  create  the 
foundations of intrusion detection and prevention mecha­
nisms,  which  will  help  IoT  entities  to  protect  or  even 
gracefully  degrade  their  services.  Finally,  recovery  ser­
vices  must  be  able  to  locate  unsafe  zones  (i.e.  zones 
affected  by  attacks)  and  redirect  the  functionality  of 
the systems to other trusted zones. 

3.2. Analysis of attacker models and threats 

As aforementioned, in order to understand how the dif­
ferent  approaches  presented  in  Section  2.2  should  be  se­
cured  in  the  future,  it  is  ﬁrstly  necessary  to  enumerate 
and analyze the attacker models. These models have been 
deﬁned in a way that they can be applied to both central­
ized  and  distributed  IoT  approaches.  Note,  however,  that 
the  concept  of  ‘perimeter’  in  the  Internet  of  Things  is  a 
bit  fuzzy:  an  attacker  can  control  part  of  the  network, 
but due to the inherent distributed nature of the IoT, it is 
nearly impossible for an attacker to fully control the whole 
system. As a result, an attacker can be both ‘internal’ and 
‘external’ at the same time. These attacker models, catego­
rized by threats, are introduced in the following paragraph. 

•  Denial  of  service  (DoS).  There are a wide number of DoS 
attacks that can be launched against the IoT. Beyond tradi­
tional Internet DoS attacks that exhaust service provider 
resources  and  network  bandwidth,  the  actual  wireless 
communication  infrastructure  of  most  data  acquisition 
networks can also be targeted (e.g. jamming the channels). 
Malicious internal attackers that take control of part of the 
infrastructure can create even more mayhem. 

•  Physical damage. This threat can be seen as a subset of 
the DoS threat. In this attacker model, active attackers 
usually lack  technical  knowledge, and  can  only hinder 
the provisioning of IoT services by destroying the actual 
‘things’.  This  is  a  realistic  attack  in  the  IoT  context, 
because  things  might  be  easily  accessible  to  anyone 
(e.g.  a  street  light).  If  that  is  not  possible,  the  attacker 
can simply target the hardware module in charge of cre­
ating the ‘virtual persona’ of the thing. 

•  Eavesdropping. Passive attackers can target various com­
munication channels (e.g. wireless networks, local wired 
networks,  Internet)  in  order  to  extract  data  from  the 
information  ﬂow.  Obviously,  an  internal  attacker  that 
gains  access  to  a  particular  infrastructure  will  be  able 
to  extract  the  information  that  circulates  within  that 
infrastructure. 

•  Node Capture. As aforementioned, things (e.g. household 
appliances, street lights) are physically located in a cer­
tain environment. Instead of destroying them, an active 
attacker can try to extract the information they contain. 
Note  also  that,  instead  of  things,  active  attackers  can 
also target other infrastructures that store information, 
such as data processing or data storage entities. 

•  Controlling.  As  long  as  there  is  an  attack  path,  active 
attackers can try to gain partial or full control over an 
IoT  entity.  The  scope  of  the  damage  caused  by  these 
attackers depends mainly on (a) the importance of the 
data managed by that particular entity, (b) the services 
that are provided by that particular entity.

While  both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches 
share  the  same  attacker  models,  there  are  subtle  differ­
ences caused by the distributed IoT features and principles. 
They change various aspects of the underlying infrastruc­
tures,  such  as  the  deployment  strategies  of  the  different 
IoT entities, the actual information ﬂow, and the availabil­
ity of certain interfaces and services. Such changes can cre­
ate  new  threats  and  facilitate  the  work  of  attackers,  but 
also can reduce the effectiveness of certain attack vectors. 
In  the  following  paragraphs  we  will  discuss  the  different 
aspects that are inﬂuenced by the distributed IoT features 
and  principles,  and  how  they  impact  the  threats  and  at­
tacker models. 

One aspect is the centralization of resources. Most adver­
saries will aim to target systems that provide the biggest 
payoff, and central entities fall under this category – they 
store, manage, and process a huge amount of information. 
Theoretically, these central entities will have better protec­
tion  mechanisms,  but  any  vulnerability  can  make  the 
whole  system  fall  apart.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  actual 
intelligence  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  distributed,  the 
information will be created and processed in different enti­
ties, thus adversaries need to redouble their efforts in order 
to control the same amount of resources. However, the dis­
tribution  of  resources  is  a  double-edged  sword.  If  the 
adversary is only interested in a speciﬁc piece of informa­
tion, it can target the system that manages that particular 
information – which might not be as protected as a central 
entity. Besides, node capture attacks become more danger­
ous, as more logic is placed within the things themselves. 
In  fact,  an  adversary  can  use  a  guerrilla  warfare  strategy 
and  gradually  take  control  of  small  parts  of  the  network, 
so as to affect the whole system in a covert way. 

Another aspect, related to the centralization of resources, 
is  the  nature  of  the  information  ﬂow.  In  centralized  IoT 
deployments, the information ﬂow will follow a hierarchical 
pattern,  as  a  central  entity  will  receive  information  from 
every  ‘thing’.  On  the  other  hand,  in  more  distributed  ap­
proaches, the information ﬂow will resemble a peer-to-peer 
system, where information is only exchanged when needed. 
In  this  particular case, an  adversary  that  eavesdrops  on  a 
section of the network will not be able to obtain a holistic 
point of view of the whole system. There is a caveat here: 
if an adversary targets an intranet of things (e.g. an IoT-en­
abled hospital) in a distributed scenario, he might be able 
to retrieve processed information instead of raw data. 

Regarding the overall connectivity of the network, in ap­
proaches  that  follow  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  con­
strained entities are expected to be directly locatable and 
addressable via the Internet. Therefore, they must be able 
to accept connections from external entities. This situation 
allows  malicious  adversaries  to  launch  attacks  that  can 
easily exhaust their resources. Observe that this situation 
can  also  arise  in  networks  (either  centralized  or  distrib­
uted)  with  actuators  (e.g.  electric  motors,  industrial 
machinery), as the behavior of actuators can change when 
receiving  orders  from  remote  administrators.  Note  also 
that  it  is  possible  to  implement  additional  protection 
mechanisms  to  control  these  incoming  connections,  such 
as ﬁrewalls and additional middleware layers. 

Finally, we also have to consider the user involvement in 
the conﬁguration of the security mechanisms. User-centric 
networks, such as personal area networks [18], are one of 
the  elements  of  the  Internet  of  Things.  By  pushing  the 
intelligence  onto  the  edge  of  the  network,  it  is  possible 
for  the  owners  of  these  networks  to  create  and  manage 
their  own  policies  (cf.  Section  3.3.4).  However,  as  most 
users are not experts, mistakes will happen if the security 
mechanisms  are  not  usable  enough.  Such  misconﬁgura­
tions  can  be  exploited  by  malicious  adversaries  to  access 
personal data or even take control of that particular user-
centric network. Note that in centralized entities the con­
ﬁguration of the security mechanisms will be made by ex­
perts,  but  any  misconﬁguration  will  create  a  very 
rewarding  window  of  opportunity  that  can  be  exploited 
by any knowledgeable adversary. 

By  reviewing  these  attacker  models,  we  can  conclude 
that no approach is better in terms of threats and attacker 
models – all  of  them have  various advantages and disad­
vantages.  In  a  centralized  IoT  the  central  entity  becomes 
a single point of failure; and although the number of attack 
vectors are smaller (and the protection mechanisms might 
be better), a single vulnerability or a misconﬁguration can 
cause  extreme  damage  to  the  whole  network.  If  the  re­
sources of the network are distributed, the impact caused 
by a successful attack will be smaller, but the number of at­
tack vectors will increase. Note that in all approaches there 
will  be  a  huge  number  of  data  providers, the  things,  that 
can  be  highly  constrained  and  physically  accessible  –  in 
other  words,  easy  targets.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  any 
IoT application will have to deal with a certain amount of 
bogus data. 

3.3. Speciﬁc challenges and promising solutions 

Once the analysis of the threats and attacker models is 
ﬁnished, we can study what are the main challenges in the 
design and deployment of the security mechanisms. Such 
study,  which  will  be  performed  in  the  next  sections,  will 
help  to  point  out  speciﬁc  problems  that  must  be  consid­
ered if we want to bring the distributed IoT architectures 
to the real world. Moreover, within this study, we will ex­
plore not only existing IoT security mechanisms,  but also 
promising approaches that could be used to provide secu­
rity in a distributed IoT environment. 

3.3.1. Identity and authentication 

It  is  essential  to  consider  how  to  manage  identity and 
authentication in the Internet of Things, as multiple enti­
ties (e.g. data sources, service providers, information pro­
cessing systems) need to authenticate each other in order 
to create trustable services [25]. When deﬁning these secu­
rity  mechanisms,  we  also  have  to  consider  some  of  the 
inherent features of the Internet of Things. As interactions 
can  be  quite  dynamic,  the  entities  of  the  network  might 
not even know in advance which partners can be used to 
create  a  certain  service.  Vehicular  networks  (VANETs 
[26]) are an example of this: cars are expected to provide 
data  not  only  to  devices  located  on  the  roadside  but  also 
to other cars. Besides, if billions of things are going to be

interconnected, it is necessary to manage their identities in 
a scalable way. 

In a centralized IoT architecture, some of these challenges 
are inherently more simple. In this particular approach, the 
application  logic  is  mainly  located  in  one  central  entity 
(e.g. a cloud-based IoT application platform) that provides 
a  limited  set  of  well-known entry  points  (e.g.  APIs).  Both 
data providers, such as sensors, and information consum­
ers, such as user applications and other customers, connect 
to this central entity. As a consequence, all the authentica­
tion logic can be centralized in this entity or in an identity 
provider associated with it. In case there are data providers 
that have their own identity provider, there are no scalabil­
ity  problems,  as  such  identity  providers  can  establish  a 
relationship of trust with the central entity (a N-to-1 sce­
nario). Note that if an IoT complies with the collaboration 
principle (Collaborative IoT), it might be possible to make 
use  of  a  federated  identity  management  system,  where 
all the service providers belong to the same circle of trust. 
This simpliﬁcation cannot be found in purely distributed 
IoT  architectures,  which  fulﬁll  both  the  collaboration  and 
edge intelligence principles. In  this context  we ﬁnd  a dy­
namic N-to-N scenario, where data providers are no longer 
passive  and  are  able  to  acquire  and  process  information 
from other sources. Moreover, due to the edge intelligence 
principle, local users can query local information providers 
directly, without intervention from external entities. As a 
result, some kind of authentication logic must be present 
in every service provider – including the tiniest of objects. 
Note, however, that things do not exist in a vacuum: they 
usually belong to a speciﬁc group, are located in a particu­
lar  context,  and  are  owned  by  certain  entities.  These  as­
pects must be taken into account. 

3.3.1.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  aforementioned,  it  is 
essential to  manage  the  identities  of  the  things in  a  scal­
able  way.  However,  as  of  2012,  there  are  various  mecha­
nisms  that  can  be  used  to  identify  things  uniquely,  such 
as  the  tag  code  standards  EPC  and  ucode  [27].  Therefore, 
it is expected that in the future various systems will coex­
ist – not only at the universal level but also at a local scale 
[28].  Note,  however,  that  in  many  scenarios  the  ‘who’  is 
less important than the ‘where’ and the ‘what’. As a conse­
quence, things should be able to identify themselves using 
their  attributes  and  their  context  (e.g.  radiation  sensor 
#2044A can simply state that is a radiation sensor located 
in Shibuya, Tokyo). 

Regarding  things  authentication,  we  have  to  consider 
that  in  many  scenarios  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(e.g. intranets of things, personal area networks) located in 
the same spatial area (e.g. IoT-enabled hospitals). In such 
environments, local identity providers can manage the iden­
tities of those things, and also can create a circle of trust with 
relevant external resource providers (e.g. the household of a 
chronic patient, other hospitals). Consequently, local enti­
ties are not only able to authenticate to each other within 
the  group,  but  also  can  provide  a  proof  of  identity  when 
interacting  with  external  entities.  Also,  external  entities 
can  receive  a  temporary  persona  (e.g.  long-term  patient) 
from  the  local  identity  provider  if  necessary.  This  group-
based strategy has been, in fact, partially considered in the 

interactions between WSN islands, where interdomain col­
laboration is possible through federated identity manage­
ment and  access  tokens translation [29].  Traditional Web 
2.0 SSO such as OpenID and Shibboleth could also be used 
in this situation, although it should be noted that they were 
not designed to fulﬁll certain IoT requirements such as iden­
tity disclosure (i.e. support for privacy) [30], thus more anal­
yses are needed. 

If the thing is actually a human being, it can also be pos­
sible to use existing authentication mechanisms (e.g. web 
credentials,  electronic  identity  cards)  if  the  resource  pro­
vider  understands  them.  For  example,  Guinard  et  al.  [31] 
proposed  a  smart  gateway  infrastructure  (Social  Access 
Controller, or SAC) that allows users to retrieve data from 
local sensors using their social network (e.g. Facebook) cre­
dentials.  Note  that  this  approach  might  not  work  in  case 
the  human  being  does  not  directly  interact  with  the  IoT 
entities. In such cases, it is necessary to develop surrogate 
mechanisms  that  can  act  on  behalf  of  the  human  users. 
One existing example is the concept of the Minimal Entity 
(ME) [32] – a device that stores the digital identity of the 
user  and  acts  as  his  representative  in  the  virtual  world. 
Not only it does provide end-to-end secure communication 
and  collaboration  with  anonymous  receivers,  but  also  al­
lows  the  implementation  of  pseudonyms.  Another  exam­
ple  is  the  concept  of  a  digital  shadow  [33],  where  users 
can  delegate  their  credentials  (including  access  control 
credentials) to multiple objects or virtual entities. 

3.3.2. Access control 

In the Internet of Things, the challenges related to Access 
Control are closely related to those found in any distributed 
system. A particular service is constructed by aggregating 
several services and data sources from different locations 
and  contexts  (e.g.  a  hospital  retrieving  information  from 
home patients and ambulances). All these information pro­
viders will have their own access control policies and per­
missions  whose 
(creation,  enforcement, 
maintenance, translation) needs to be managed. 

life  cycle 

There are also some speciﬁc issues that must be taken 
into account in the context of the IoT. Granularity (i.e. pro­
viding more information to people with the right creden­
tials)  and  location  (i.e.  checking  whether  users  are 
accessing  the  services  of  a  thing  locally  or  remotely)  be­
come important elements of the access control policies in 
certain  scenarios.  For  example,  in  case  of  an  accident, 
everyone at the crash site can access my blood group, but 
only certiﬁed doctors and nurses can access my vital signs. 
Also,  whenever  access  control  mechanisms  are  imple­
mented  at  the  thing  level,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the 
amount  of  computational  resources  that  are  available,  as 
constrained  devices  might  not  have  enough  space  to 
implement  a  complex  access  control  mechanism.  Finally, 
as  many  things  are  owned  by  their  users  (either  perma­
nently or temporarily) and may belong to a group (e.g. per­
sonal area network), it is necessary to consider the design 
of delegation mechanisms, as these things may act in the 
name of the user/group. 

As with authentication, access control policies are eas­
ier to manage in centralized IoT architectures: all access con­
trol policies are stored and managed within a single central

entity. Therefore, data providers do not need to implement 
any kind of access control logic: they will send all their data 
to those whom they trust (i.e. the central entity). As a side 
effect of this conﬁguration, both data providers and infor­
mation consumers must completely trust the central entity, 
as  it  will  store  the  information  generated  by  all  network 
entities. On the other hand, purely distributed IoT architec­
tures have to deal with all previously mentioned challenges: 
management of heterogeneous policies, multiple enforce­
ment points, etc. Nevertheless, as will be mentioned in Sec­
tion 3.3.4, the overall privacy of the network improves once 
the things can control directly who accesses their own data. 
Observe  that  additional  mechanisms  must  be  imple­
mented  whenever  the  collaboration  principle  is  applied 
to centralized IoT architectures (e.g. tools for maintaining 
consistency between access control lists, resource delega­
tion  mechanisms).  Note  also  that  we  need  to  manually 
conﬁgure  the  direct  links  between  the  intranets  and  the 
external  entities  in  networks  that  only  comply  with  the 
edge intelligence principle. 

3.3.2.1. Promising approaches.  There have been very few ad­
vances  in  the  management  of  access  control  policies  for 
distributed IoTs. In fact, it is not trivial to apply existing ac­
cess control approaches to completely distributed environ­
ments.  For  example,  there  are  scalability  and  consistency 
issues  when  storing  the  list  of  users  and  their  associated 
access rights in access control lists (ACLs). Role-based ac­
cess control (RBAC) mechanisms need to deﬁne the differ­
ent roles that users can take, which might be different in 
various contexts even if they refer to the same type of en­
tity  (e.g. custodian vs. janitor).  Finally, RBAC policies that 
use attribute certiﬁcates [34] need of an infrastructure that 
allows validating such certiﬁcates in a cross-domain envi­
ronment. Note, however, that due to the speciﬁc features of 
the Internet of Things, it is possible to consider certain fac­
tors  such  as  context  as  part  of  the  access  control  model 
[35].  As a consequence, with adequate technological  sup­
port, certain policies (e.g. only authenticated users located 
within  my  vicinity  during  working  hours  can  access  to­
day’s reports) can be easily implemented. 

Besides,  there  are  various  simple  strategies  that  could 
be  used  whenever  the  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(cf.  Section  3.3.1).  For  example,  the  access  control  logic 
could  be  pushed  to  speciﬁc  trusted  entities,  which  will 
act as token-granting services à la Kerberos (i.e. a thing will 
grant access to anyone that has a valid signature created by 
a  trusted  entity).  In  another  approach,  the  access  control 
logic  can  be  implemented  within  the  things  themselves, 
but relying only on locally-deﬁned roles (e.g. a doctor from 
another  hospital  must  retrieve  his  locally-issued  role  be­
fore  interacting  with  the  local  things).  A  drawback  of  all 
these strategies is that users must ﬁrst access the trusted 
entity before requesting information from the things. 

3.3.3. Protocol and network security 

A  secure  communications  channel  is,  in  most  cases,  a 
byproduct  of  a  successful  authentication  (e.g.  server 
authentication  or  mutual  authentication  using  protocols 
such  as  TLS/DTLS).  This  process  will  make  use  of  certain 
user credentials, such as shared keys or X.509 certiﬁcates. 

If there is a limited set of well-known centralized applica­
tion  providers  (i.e.  central  entities),  the  distribution  and 
management  of  these  credentials  becomes  easier,  as  it  is 
possible  to  preload  information  in  the  devices.  However, 
in  distributed  IoT  architectures,  extra  challenges  arise:  any 
entity can connect with any other entity at any time, these 
entities  might  not  know  each  other  in  advance,  and  also 
limited devices can exchange information with other lim­
ited  devices.  Therefore,  in  this  scenario  key  management 
becomes a signiﬁcant problem. 

There are some additional challenges related to the com­
putational resources available to things. When opening a se­
cure channel, devices should be able to negotiate the actual 
parameters of that channel, such as algorithms (e.g. RSA vs. 
ECC), strength (AES-128 vs. AES-256), and protection mech­
anisms (only integrity vs. conﬁdentiality and integrity). The 
ﬁrst  reason  is  obvious:  constrained  devices  might  not  be 
able to implement certain conﬁgurations. There is another 
reason, though: adaptability. Depending on various factors 
such as the level of criticality of the data, it might not be nec­
essary to apply strong protection mechanisms to a particu­
lar  information  ﬂow  (e.g.  conﬁdentiality  and  the  on/off 
status of a street light). Another challenge is the need to ana­
lyze  the  number  of  security  protocols  that  can  be  imple­
mented within a constrained device. In fact, it is necessary 
to  carefully  study  whether  existing  Internet  protocols 
should be adapted to this context or not. Finally, things that 
can  be  accessed  directly  (e.g.  in  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach)  need  to  be  careful about  the  overhead caused by 
incoming connections (e.g. multiple incoming connections 
that require the use of public key cryptography). 

3.3.3.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  the  Internet  of  Things 
inhabits the Internet ecosystem, it is important to provide 
support for existing security protocols. In fact, the security 
of IoT-designed web transfer protocols, such as CoAP (Con­
strained Application Protocol), is largely dependant on the 
implementation of these security protocols [36]. Some pro­
tocols can be implemented without any major changes. For 
example, there are commercial implementations available 
of DTLS for constrained devices [37]. However, other proto­
cols need to be adapted due to the complexity of their de­
sign.  Such  protocols  must  achieve  a  tradeoff  between 
simplicity  and  compatibility.  For  example,  one  approach 
seeks  to  apply  IPsec  to  constrained  environments by  bal­
ancing  link-layer  security  and  IPsec  security  (cf.  Raza 
et al. [38]). 

As for the distribution of the credentials, there are var­
ious strategies that could be used to tackle this problem. As 
aforementioned  (cf.  Sections  3.3.1  and  3.3.2),  whenever 
things  belong  to  a  particular  local  group,  it  is  possible  to 
have one or various entities in charge of managing and dis­
tributing  the  credentials.  Also,  in  scenarios  where  clients 
and servers know each other in advance, it is also possible 
to  use  certain  symmetric  key-based  protocols,  which  can 
provide good properties such as high resilience to attacks 
[39].  Finally,  beyond  the  optimization  of  these  security 
protocols, there are various researchers that  are pursuing 
the  implementation  of  fast  and  compact  cryptographic 
algorithms.  There  are  various  research  areas,  which  are 
not  mutually  exclusive:  from  the  design  of  novel  hash

functions and symmetric algorithms [40] to the optimiza­
tion of existing primitives [41]. 

3.3.4. Privacy 

Up to this point we have seen that a distributed IoT archi­
tecture requires more complex security mechanisms. There 
is, however, one area where distributed IoTs provide immedi­
ate beneﬁts: Data management and privacy. The core idea is 
that, due to the edge intelligence principle, every entity has 
more control over the data it generates and processes. There 
are several consequences of this approach. Firstly, entities 
can  control  the  granularity  of  the  data  they  produce.  For 
example, a portable radiation sensor can announce that it 
is located in a certain area without providing its exact coor­
dinates. Secondly, entities can deﬁne their own access poli­
cies. The previously mentioned object can provide the city 
where it is located (Tokyo) to anonymous entities, the area 
where it is deployed (Shibuya, Tokyo) to entities with ade­
quate permissions, or even detailed GPS location informa­
tion  to  local  entities  in  case  of  emergencies.  Thirdly, 
entities do not need to provide all the data they produce, 
only the data that is needed by the external entities for a par­
ticular service. This is closely related to privacy, as it will be 
more difﬁcult to create a proﬁle of a certain entity if not all 
information is available. 

As for centralized IoT architectures (including those who 
comply  with  the  collaboration  principle),  a  data  provider 
can  also  decide  whether  to  share  or  not  a  particular data 
stream. Still, as the intelligence is located on the central en­
tity, the type of services it provides will be limited to the 
amount of data it receives. Another approach can be used 
if the centralized architecture complies with the edge intel­
ligence  principle:  as  data  providers  and  information  con­
sumers  are  able  to  communicate  directly,  they  might 
negotiate a set of secret keys in order to protect their infor­
mation. However, in this case the central entity cannot pro­
cess  the  data,  thus  it  becomes  a  simple  storage  system 
unless it implements advanced cryptographic mechanisms 
that can manipulate encrypted data, such as homomorphic 
encryption. 

As a ﬁnal note, we have to point out that the previous 
paragraphs  focus  mainly  on  the  protection  of  personal 
information, but there is another dimension of privacy that 
is  especially  relevant  in  the  context  of  the  IoT:  the  exis­
tence of entities that proﬁle and track users without their 
consent. Here, the beneﬁts of a distributed IoT might turn 
into  nightmares  when  misused.  By  following  the  edge 
intelligence  principle,  entities  can  adapt  their  behavior 
and track users more effectively. Moreover, thanks to the 
collaboration principle, these entities can share up-to-date 
information about the target. 

3.3.4.1. Promising approaches.  The distributed IoT approach 
facilitates  the  implementation  of  the  privacy-by-design 
principles  [24],  as  all  entities  can  directly  manage  their 
own data. However, it is necessary to go beyond the imple­
mentation of user-centric access policies and mechanisms 
to control the granularity of the provided data. Whenever 
human beings are involved, aspects such as the usability of 
the user interface (e.g. what can be accessed and to what ex­
tent [42]) should be taken into account. As data will be dis­

tributed  amongst  various  entities,  it  also  is  necessary  to 
study  the  applicability  of  existing  privacy-preserving  dis­
tributed data mining algorithms [43]. For example, certain 
privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) [44] such as multi­
party computations [45] can be used to provide protection 
to some cooperative protocols (e.g. cooperative benchmark­
ing and forecasting). For especially sensitive data, advanced 
concepts such as active bundles (i.e. a container with a pay­
load of sensitive data, metadata, and a virtual machine (VM) 
[46])  might be  used. Finally, the legal  privacy regulations 
should be revised to fully consider the intricacies of an al­
ways connected Internet of Things [47]. 

Regarding  the  problem  of  user  tracking  and  proﬁling, 
there are some ongoing efforts in the research community 
that aim to provide solutions for this particular threat. For 
example, there is an interesting perspective that considers 
a local environment as an operative system [48]. In short, 
incoming and outgoing items need to be scanned for rogue 
devices and malicious software that can threaten the pri­
vacy  of  the  user.  This  can  be  achieved  by  using  mecha­
nisms  such  as  the  privacy  coach  [49].  However,  as  users 
could  be  tracked  anywhere  and  anytime,  these  concepts 
should be extended in order to help users to become more 
aware  of  how  their  surroundings  capture  and  use  their 
information.  Frameworks  like  uTRUSTit  (cf.  Section  3.3.5) 
might help in this area. Besides, existing studies on surveil­
lance systems such as CCTVs [50] might also provide a clue 
on  the  speciﬁc  legal  challenges  that  our  society  will  face 
once the Internet of Things becomes a reality. 

3.3.5. Trust and governance 

There  are  other  areas  where  both  centralized  and  dis­
tributed  IoT  approaches  have  their  own  speciﬁc  advanta­
ges  and  disadvantages.  One  of  those  areas  is  Trust 
Management.  As  aforementioned,  in  the  IoT  we  can  con­
sider two dimensions of trust: trust in the interactions be­
tween  entities,  and  trust  in  the  system  from  the  users’ 
perspective.  In  a  centralized  IoT,  uncertainty  comes  from 
the  interactions  with  the  data  providers  (‘Which  data  is 
more reliable  and  fresh?’). The  holistic  point of  view  of  a 
central  entity  can  help  in  calculating  the  reputation  of 
other entities (e.g. a radiation sensor cannot give a warning 
if all sensors in the vicinity provide a low value). However, 
if  different  central  entities  collaborate  with  each  other, 
they must be able to exchange trust information in order 
to ﬁx inconsistencies in the reputation values. In a distrib­
uted IoT, there is uncertainty in both the interactions with 
the  data  providers  and  the  interactions  with  the  service 
providers (‘Who can give me a robust and timely service?’). 
The  distributed  infrastructure  makes  the  management  of 
trust more complicated: how can reputation and trust be 
calculated and shared? Which ontology should I use? Can 
I  trust  the  reports  from  other  systems?  Still,  these  trust 
management systems can make better use of second-hand 
information sources: when a certain entity is given a low 
reputation, this reputation can be propagated to other enti­
ties that might interact with such an outlier in the future. 
As for the trust in the system, it is largely dependant on 
knowing  the  internal  state  of  the  Internet  of  Things  that 
surround  us.  In  a  centralized  IoT  not  all  information  will 
be available: in order to provide services, a central entity

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

deployments. The purpose of this paper is to assess and an­
swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies.

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

into the Internet of Things, have been already enumerated 
by the research community [3,22,23]. They are as follows: 

•  Heterogeneity  has  a  great  inﬂuence  over  the  protocol 
and  network  security  services  that  must  be  imple­
mented  in  the  IoT.  Constrained  devices  will  interact 
with  various  heterogeneous  devices  (e.g.  other  con­
strained  devices,  full-ﬂedged  web  servers)  either 
directly or through gateways. In this scenario, not only 
it is essential to implement efﬁcient cryptographic algo­
rithms that can provide a high throughput even in 8-bit 
or 16-bit devices, but also to adapt or create lightweight 
security protocols that offer an end-to-end secure com­
munication  channel.  These  protocols  require  creden­
tials,  thus  optimal  key  management  systems  must  be 
implemented to distribute these credentials and to help 
in  establishing  the  necessary  session  keys  between 
peers. 

•  The existence of billions of heterogeneous objects also 
affects  identity  management.  Beyond  deﬁning  the 
actual scope of ‘identity’ in this context (e.g. underlying 
identity  vs.  real  identity,  core  identity  vs.  temporary 
identity),  we  also  need  to  provide  some  mechanisms 
for achieving universal authentication. Without authen­
tication,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  assure  that  the  data 
ﬂow  produced  by  a  certain  entity  contains  what  it  is 
supposed to contain. Another important aspect related 
to  authentication  is  authorization.  If  there  is  no  access 
control  whatsoever,  everything  will  be  accessed  by 
everyone, which is neither viable nor realistic. 

•  In fact, the data deluge caused by billions of entities cre­
ating information is a big threat to privacy. Users must 
have tools that allow them to retain their anonymity in 
this superconnected world. Other tools must provide a 
snapshot  of  the  information  and  policies  surrounding 
a particular user, enabling transparency and preventing 
the notion that the IoT is silently controlling our lives. 
In fact, the IoT itself must seriously consider the imple­
mentation of the privacy by design principles [24], pro­
viding  user-centric  support  for  security  and  privacy 
from its very own foundations. 

•  The  size  and  heterogeneity  of  the  IoT  also  affects  its 
trust  and  governance.  There  are  actually  two  dimen­
sions of trust: (a) trust in the interaction between enti­
ties, where we have to deal with uncertainty about the 
future actions of all collaborating entities, and (b) trust 
in  the  system  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  user,  as 
users must be able to manage their things so as to not 
feel  under  some  unknown  external  control.  Regarding 
governance,  it  is  a  double-edged  sword  that  must  be 
wielded with care. On the  one hand, it offers  stability, 
support  for  political  decisions,  and  the  possibility  to 
deﬁne common frameworks and interoperability mech­
anisms.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily 
become  excessive, 
fostering  an  over-controlled 
environment. 

•  The number of vulnerable systems and attacks vectors 
will surely increase in the context of the IoT, thus fault 
tolerance  becomes  essential.  Not  only  we  must  strive 
for  security  by  default  (robust  implementations,  usable 
systems,  etc.)  in  the  IoT,  but  also  we  need  to  develop 

awareness  mechanisms  that  can  be  used  to  create  the 
foundations of intrusion detection and prevention mecha­
nisms,  which  will  help  IoT  entities  to  protect  or  even 
gracefully  degrade  their  services.  Finally,  recovery  ser­
vices  must  be  able  to  locate  unsafe  zones  (i.e.  zones 
affected  by  attacks)  and  redirect  the  functionality  of 
the systems to other trusted zones. 

3.2. Analysis of attacker models and threats 

As aforementioned, in order to understand how the dif­
ferent  approaches  presented  in  Section  2.2  should  be  se­
cured  in  the  future,  it  is  ﬁrstly  necessary  to  enumerate 
and analyze the attacker models. These models have been 
deﬁned in a way that they can be applied to both central­
ized  and  distributed  IoT  approaches.  Note,  however,  that 
the  concept  of  ‘perimeter’  in  the  Internet  of  Things  is  a 
bit  fuzzy:  an  attacker  can  control  part  of  the  network, 
but due to the inherent distributed nature of the IoT, it is 
nearly impossible for an attacker to fully control the whole 
system. As a result, an attacker can be both ‘internal’ and 
‘external’ at the same time. These attacker models, catego­
rized by threats, are introduced in the following paragraph. 

•  Denial  of  service  (DoS).  There are a wide number of DoS 
attacks that can be launched against the IoT. Beyond tradi­
tional Internet DoS attacks that exhaust service provider 
resources  and  network  bandwidth,  the  actual  wireless 
communication  infrastructure  of  most  data  acquisition 
networks can also be targeted (e.g. jamming the channels). 
Malicious internal attackers that take control of part of the 
infrastructure can create even more mayhem. 

•  Physical damage. This threat can be seen as a subset of 
the DoS threat. In this attacker model, active attackers 
usually lack  technical  knowledge, and  can  only hinder 
the provisioning of IoT services by destroying the actual 
‘things’.  This  is  a  realistic  attack  in  the  IoT  context, 
because  things  might  be  easily  accessible  to  anyone 
(e.g.  a  street  light).  If  that  is  not  possible,  the  attacker 
can simply target the hardware module in charge of cre­
ating the ‘virtual persona’ of the thing. 

•  Eavesdropping. Passive attackers can target various com­
munication channels (e.g. wireless networks, local wired 
networks,  Internet)  in  order  to  extract  data  from  the 
information  ﬂow.  Obviously,  an  internal  attacker  that 
gains  access  to  a  particular  infrastructure  will  be  able 
to  extract  the  information  that  circulates  within  that 
infrastructure. 

•  Node Capture. As aforementioned, things (e.g. household 
appliances, street lights) are physically located in a cer­
tain environment. Instead of destroying them, an active 
attacker can try to extract the information they contain. 
Note  also  that,  instead  of  things,  active  attackers  can 
also target other infrastructures that store information, 
such as data processing or data storage entities. 

•  Controlling.  As  long  as  there  is  an  attack  path,  active 
attackers can try to gain partial or full control over an 
IoT  entity.  The  scope  of  the  damage  caused  by  these 
attackers depends mainly on (a) the importance of the 
data managed by that particular entity, (b) the services 
that are provided by that particular entity.

While  both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches 
share  the  same  attacker  models,  there  are  subtle  differ­
ences caused by the distributed IoT features and principles. 
They change various aspects of the underlying infrastruc­
tures,  such  as  the  deployment  strategies  of  the  different 
IoT entities, the actual information ﬂow, and the availabil­
ity of certain interfaces and services. Such changes can cre­
ate  new  threats  and  facilitate  the  work  of  attackers,  but 
also can reduce the effectiveness of certain attack vectors. 
In  the  following  paragraphs  we  will  discuss  the  different 
aspects that are inﬂuenced by the distributed IoT features 
and  principles,  and  how  they  impact  the  threats  and  at­
tacker models. 

One aspect is the centralization of resources. Most adver­
saries will aim to target systems that provide the biggest 
payoff, and central entities fall under this category – they 
store, manage, and process a huge amount of information. 
Theoretically, these central entities will have better protec­
tion  mechanisms,  but  any  vulnerability  can  make  the 
whole  system  fall  apart.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  actual 
intelligence  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  distributed,  the 
information will be created and processed in different enti­
ties, thus adversaries need to redouble their efforts in order 
to control the same amount of resources. However, the dis­
tribution  of  resources  is  a  double-edged  sword.  If  the 
adversary is only interested in a speciﬁc piece of informa­
tion, it can target the system that manages that particular 
information – which might not be as protected as a central 
entity. Besides, node capture attacks become more danger­
ous, as more logic is placed within the things themselves. 
In  fact,  an  adversary  can  use  a  guerrilla  warfare  strategy 
and  gradually  take  control  of  small  parts  of  the  network, 
so as to affect the whole system in a covert way. 

Another aspect, related to the centralization of resources, 
is  the  nature  of  the  information  ﬂow.  In  centralized  IoT 
deployments, the information ﬂow will follow a hierarchical 
pattern,  as  a  central  entity  will  receive  information  from 
every  ‘thing’.  On  the  other  hand,  in  more  distributed  ap­
proaches, the information ﬂow will resemble a peer-to-peer 
system, where information is only exchanged when needed. 
In  this  particular case, an  adversary  that  eavesdrops  on  a 
section of the network will not be able to obtain a holistic 
point of view of the whole system. There is a caveat here: 
if an adversary targets an intranet of things (e.g. an IoT-en­
abled hospital) in a distributed scenario, he might be able 
to retrieve processed information instead of raw data. 

Regarding the overall connectivity of the network, in ap­
proaches  that  follow  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  con­
strained entities are expected to be directly locatable and 
addressable via the Internet. Therefore, they must be able 
to accept connections from external entities. This situation 
allows  malicious  adversaries  to  launch  attacks  that  can 
easily exhaust their resources. Observe that this situation 
can  also  arise  in  networks  (either  centralized  or  distrib­
uted)  with  actuators  (e.g.  electric  motors,  industrial 
machinery), as the behavior of actuators can change when 
receiving  orders  from  remote  administrators.  Note  also 
that  it  is  possible  to  implement  additional  protection 
mechanisms  to  control  these  incoming  connections,  such 
as ﬁrewalls and additional middleware layers. 

Finally, we also have to consider the user involvement in 
the conﬁguration of the security mechanisms. User-centric 
networks, such as personal area networks [18], are one of 
the  elements  of  the  Internet  of  Things.  By  pushing  the 
intelligence  onto  the  edge  of  the  network,  it  is  possible 
for  the  owners  of  these  networks  to  create  and  manage 
their  own  policies  (cf.  Section  3.3.4).  However,  as  most 
users are not experts, mistakes will happen if the security 
mechanisms  are  not  usable  enough.  Such  misconﬁgura­
tions  can  be  exploited  by  malicious  adversaries  to  access 
personal data or even take control of that particular user-
centric network. Note that in centralized entities the con­
ﬁguration of the security mechanisms will be made by ex­
perts,  but  any  misconﬁguration  will  create  a  very 
rewarding  window  of  opportunity  that  can  be  exploited 
by any knowledgeable adversary. 

By  reviewing  these  attacker  models,  we  can  conclude 
that no approach is better in terms of threats and attacker 
models – all  of  them have  various advantages and disad­
vantages.  In  a  centralized  IoT  the  central  entity  becomes 
a single point of failure; and although the number of attack 
vectors are smaller (and the protection mechanisms might 
be better), a single vulnerability or a misconﬁguration can 
cause  extreme  damage  to  the  whole  network.  If  the  re­
sources of the network are distributed, the impact caused 
by a successful attack will be smaller, but the number of at­
tack vectors will increase. Note that in all approaches there 
will  be  a  huge  number  of  data  providers, the  things,  that 
can  be  highly  constrained  and  physically  accessible  –  in 
other  words,  easy  targets.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  any 
IoT application will have to deal with a certain amount of 
bogus data. 

3.3. Speciﬁc challenges and promising solutions 

Once the analysis of the threats and attacker models is 
ﬁnished, we can study what are the main challenges in the 
design and deployment of the security mechanisms. Such 
study,  which  will  be  performed  in  the  next  sections,  will 
help  to  point  out  speciﬁc  problems  that  must  be  consid­
ered if we want to bring the distributed IoT architectures 
to the real world. Moreover, within this study, we will ex­
plore not only existing IoT security mechanisms,  but also 
promising approaches that could be used to provide secu­
rity in a distributed IoT environment. 

3.3.1. Identity and authentication 

It  is  essential  to  consider  how  to  manage  identity and 
authentication in the Internet of Things, as multiple enti­
ties (e.g. data sources, service providers, information pro­
cessing systems) need to authenticate each other in order 
to create trustable services [25]. When deﬁning these secu­
rity  mechanisms,  we  also  have  to  consider  some  of  the 
inherent features of the Internet of Things. As interactions 
can  be  quite  dynamic,  the  entities  of  the  network  might 
not even know in advance which partners can be used to 
create  a  certain  service.  Vehicular  networks  (VANETs 
[26]) are an example of this: cars are expected to provide 
data  not  only  to  devices  located  on  the  roadside  but  also 
to other cars. Besides, if billions of things are going to be

interconnected, it is necessary to manage their identities in 
a scalable way. 

In a centralized IoT architecture, some of these challenges 
are inherently more simple. In this particular approach, the 
application  logic  is  mainly  located  in  one  central  entity 
(e.g. a cloud-based IoT application platform) that provides 
a  limited  set  of  well-known entry  points  (e.g.  APIs).  Both 
data providers, such as sensors, and information consum­
ers, such as user applications and other customers, connect 
to this central entity. As a consequence, all the authentica­
tion logic can be centralized in this entity or in an identity 
provider associated with it. In case there are data providers 
that have their own identity provider, there are no scalabil­
ity  problems,  as  such  identity  providers  can  establish  a 
relationship of trust with the central entity (a N-to-1 sce­
nario). Note that if an IoT complies with the collaboration 
principle (Collaborative IoT), it might be possible to make 
use  of  a  federated  identity  management  system,  where 
all the service providers belong to the same circle of trust. 
This simpliﬁcation cannot be found in purely distributed 
IoT  architectures,  which  fulﬁll  both  the  collaboration  and 
edge intelligence principles. In  this context  we ﬁnd  a dy­
namic N-to-N scenario, where data providers are no longer 
passive  and  are  able  to  acquire  and  process  information 
from other sources. Moreover, due to the edge intelligence 
principle, local users can query local information providers 
directly, without intervention from external entities. As a 
result, some kind of authentication logic must be present 
in every service provider – including the tiniest of objects. 
Note, however, that things do not exist in a vacuum: they 
usually belong to a speciﬁc group, are located in a particu­
lar  context,  and  are  owned  by  certain  entities.  These  as­
pects must be taken into account. 

3.3.1.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  aforementioned,  it  is 
essential to  manage  the  identities  of  the  things in  a  scal­
able  way.  However,  as  of  2012,  there  are  various  mecha­
nisms  that  can  be  used  to  identify  things  uniquely,  such 
as  the  tag  code  standards  EPC  and  ucode  [27].  Therefore, 
it is expected that in the future various systems will coex­
ist – not only at the universal level but also at a local scale 
[28].  Note,  however,  that  in  many  scenarios  the  ‘who’  is 
less important than the ‘where’ and the ‘what’. As a conse­
quence, things should be able to identify themselves using 
their  attributes  and  their  context  (e.g.  radiation  sensor 
#2044A can simply state that is a radiation sensor located 
in Shibuya, Tokyo). 

Regarding  things  authentication,  we  have  to  consider 
that  in  many  scenarios  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(e.g. intranets of things, personal area networks) located in 
the same spatial area (e.g. IoT-enabled hospitals). In such 
environments, local identity providers can manage the iden­
tities of those things, and also can create a circle of trust with 
relevant external resource providers (e.g. the household of a 
chronic patient, other hospitals). Consequently, local enti­
ties are not only able to authenticate to each other within 
the  group,  but  also  can  provide  a  proof  of  identity  when 
interacting  with  external  entities.  Also,  external  entities 
can  receive  a  temporary  persona  (e.g.  long-term  patient) 
from  the  local  identity  provider  if  necessary.  This  group-
based strategy has been, in fact, partially considered in the 

interactions between WSN islands, where interdomain col­
laboration is possible through federated identity manage­
ment and  access  tokens translation [29].  Traditional Web 
2.0 SSO such as OpenID and Shibboleth could also be used 
in this situation, although it should be noted that they were 
not designed to fulﬁll certain IoT requirements such as iden­
tity disclosure (i.e. support for privacy) [30], thus more anal­
yses are needed. 

If the thing is actually a human being, it can also be pos­
sible to use existing authentication mechanisms (e.g. web 
credentials,  electronic  identity  cards)  if  the  resource  pro­
vider  understands  them.  For  example,  Guinard  et  al.  [31] 
proposed  a  smart  gateway  infrastructure  (Social  Access 
Controller, or SAC) that allows users to retrieve data from 
local sensors using their social network (e.g. Facebook) cre­
dentials.  Note  that  this  approach  might  not  work  in  case 
the  human  being  does  not  directly  interact  with  the  IoT 
entities. In such cases, it is necessary to develop surrogate 
mechanisms  that  can  act  on  behalf  of  the  human  users. 
One existing example is the concept of the Minimal Entity 
(ME) [32] – a device that stores the digital identity of the 
user  and  acts  as  his  representative  in  the  virtual  world. 
Not only it does provide end-to-end secure communication 
and  collaboration  with  anonymous  receivers,  but  also  al­
lows  the  implementation  of  pseudonyms.  Another  exam­
ple  is  the  concept  of  a  digital  shadow  [33],  where  users 
can  delegate  their  credentials  (including  access  control 
credentials) to multiple objects or virtual entities. 

3.3.2. Access control 

In the Internet of Things, the challenges related to Access 
Control are closely related to those found in any distributed 
system. A particular service is constructed by aggregating 
several services and data sources from different locations 
and  contexts  (e.g.  a  hospital  retrieving  information  from 
home patients and ambulances). All these information pro­
viders will have their own access control policies and per­
missions  whose 
(creation,  enforcement, 
maintenance, translation) needs to be managed. 

life  cycle 

There are also some speciﬁc issues that must be taken 
into account in the context of the IoT. Granularity (i.e. pro­
viding more information to people with the right creden­
tials)  and  location  (i.e.  checking  whether  users  are 
accessing  the  services  of  a  thing  locally  or  remotely)  be­
come important elements of the access control policies in 
certain  scenarios.  For  example,  in  case  of  an  accident, 
everyone at the crash site can access my blood group, but 
only certiﬁed doctors and nurses can access my vital signs. 
Also,  whenever  access  control  mechanisms  are  imple­
mented  at  the  thing  level,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the 
amount  of  computational  resources  that  are  available,  as 
constrained  devices  might  not  have  enough  space  to 
implement  a  complex  access  control  mechanism.  Finally, 
as  many  things  are  owned  by  their  users  (either  perma­
nently or temporarily) and may belong to a group (e.g. per­
sonal area network), it is necessary to consider the design 
of delegation mechanisms, as these things may act in the 
name of the user/group. 

As with authentication, access control policies are eas­
ier to manage in centralized IoT architectures: all access con­
trol policies are stored and managed within a single central

entity. Therefore, data providers do not need to implement 
any kind of access control logic: they will send all their data 
to those whom they trust (i.e. the central entity). As a side 
effect of this conﬁguration, both data providers and infor­
mation consumers must completely trust the central entity, 
as  it  will  store  the  information  generated  by  all  network 
entities. On the other hand, purely distributed IoT architec­
tures have to deal with all previously mentioned challenges: 
management of heterogeneous policies, multiple enforce­
ment points, etc. Nevertheless, as will be mentioned in Sec­
tion 3.3.4, the overall privacy of the network improves once 
the things can control directly who accesses their own data. 
Observe  that  additional  mechanisms  must  be  imple­
mented  whenever  the  collaboration  principle  is  applied 
to centralized IoT architectures (e.g. tools for maintaining 
consistency between access control lists, resource delega­
tion  mechanisms).  Note  also  that  we  need  to  manually 
conﬁgure  the  direct  links  between  the  intranets  and  the 
external  entities  in  networks  that  only  comply  with  the 
edge intelligence principle. 

3.3.2.1. Promising approaches.  There have been very few ad­
vances  in  the  management  of  access  control  policies  for 
distributed IoTs. In fact, it is not trivial to apply existing ac­
cess control approaches to completely distributed environ­
ments.  For  example,  there  are  scalability  and  consistency 
issues  when  storing  the  list  of  users  and  their  associated 
access rights in access control lists (ACLs). Role-based ac­
cess control (RBAC) mechanisms need to deﬁne the differ­
ent roles that users can take, which might be different in 
various contexts even if they refer to the same type of en­
tity  (e.g. custodian vs. janitor).  Finally, RBAC policies that 
use attribute certiﬁcates [34] need of an infrastructure that 
allows validating such certiﬁcates in a cross-domain envi­
ronment. Note, however, that due to the speciﬁc features of 
the Internet of Things, it is possible to consider certain fac­
tors  such  as  context  as  part  of  the  access  control  model 
[35].  As a consequence, with adequate technological  sup­
port, certain policies (e.g. only authenticated users located 
within  my  vicinity  during  working  hours  can  access  to­
day’s reports) can be easily implemented. 

Besides,  there  are  various  simple  strategies  that  could 
be  used  whenever  the  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(cf.  Section  3.3.1).  For  example,  the  access  control  logic 
could  be  pushed  to  speciﬁc  trusted  entities,  which  will 
act as token-granting services à la Kerberos (i.e. a thing will 
grant access to anyone that has a valid signature created by 
a  trusted  entity).  In  another  approach,  the  access  control 
logic  can  be  implemented  within  the  things  themselves, 
but relying only on locally-deﬁned roles (e.g. a doctor from 
another  hospital  must  retrieve  his  locally-issued  role  be­
fore  interacting  with  the  local  things).  A  drawback  of  all 
these strategies is that users must ﬁrst access the trusted 
entity before requesting information from the things. 

3.3.3. Protocol and network security 

A  secure  communications  channel  is,  in  most  cases,  a 
byproduct  of  a  successful  authentication  (e.g.  server 
authentication  or  mutual  authentication  using  protocols 
such  as  TLS/DTLS).  This  process  will  make  use  of  certain 
user credentials, such as shared keys or X.509 certiﬁcates. 

If there is a limited set of well-known centralized applica­
tion  providers  (i.e.  central  entities),  the  distribution  and 
management  of  these  credentials  becomes  easier,  as  it  is 
possible  to  preload  information  in  the  devices.  However, 
in  distributed  IoT  architectures,  extra  challenges  arise:  any 
entity can connect with any other entity at any time, these 
entities  might  not  know  each  other  in  advance,  and  also 
limited devices can exchange information with other lim­
ited  devices.  Therefore,  in  this  scenario  key  management 
becomes a signiﬁcant problem. 

There are some additional challenges related to the com­
putational resources available to things. When opening a se­
cure channel, devices should be able to negotiate the actual 
parameters of that channel, such as algorithms (e.g. RSA vs. 
ECC), strength (AES-128 vs. AES-256), and protection mech­
anisms (only integrity vs. conﬁdentiality and integrity). The 
ﬁrst  reason  is  obvious:  constrained  devices  might  not  be 
able to implement certain conﬁgurations. There is another 
reason, though: adaptability. Depending on various factors 
such as the level of criticality of the data, it might not be nec­
essary to apply strong protection mechanisms to a particu­
lar  information  ﬂow  (e.g.  conﬁdentiality  and  the  on/off 
status of a street light). Another challenge is the need to ana­
lyze  the  number  of  security  protocols  that  can  be  imple­
mented within a constrained device. In fact, it is necessary 
to  carefully  study  whether  existing  Internet  protocols 
should be adapted to this context or not. Finally, things that 
can  be  accessed  directly  (e.g.  in  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach)  need  to  be  careful about  the  overhead caused by 
incoming connections (e.g. multiple incoming connections 
that require the use of public key cryptography). 

3.3.3.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  the  Internet  of  Things 
inhabits the Internet ecosystem, it is important to provide 
support for existing security protocols. In fact, the security 
of IoT-designed web transfer protocols, such as CoAP (Con­
strained Application Protocol), is largely dependant on the 
implementation of these security protocols [36]. Some pro­
tocols can be implemented without any major changes. For 
example, there are commercial implementations available 
of DTLS for constrained devices [37]. However, other proto­
cols need to be adapted due to the complexity of their de­
sign.  Such  protocols  must  achieve  a  tradeoff  between 
simplicity  and  compatibility.  For  example,  one  approach 
seeks  to  apply  IPsec  to  constrained  environments by  bal­
ancing  link-layer  security  and  IPsec  security  (cf.  Raza 
et al. [38]). 

As for the distribution of the credentials, there are var­
ious strategies that could be used to tackle this problem. As 
aforementioned  (cf.  Sections  3.3.1  and  3.3.2),  whenever 
things  belong  to  a  particular  local  group,  it  is  possible  to 
have one or various entities in charge of managing and dis­
tributing  the  credentials.  Also,  in  scenarios  where  clients 
and servers know each other in advance, it is also possible 
to  use  certain  symmetric  key-based  protocols,  which  can 
provide good properties such as high resilience to attacks 
[39].  Finally,  beyond  the  optimization  of  these  security 
protocols, there are various researchers that  are pursuing 
the  implementation  of  fast  and  compact  cryptographic 
algorithms.  There  are  various  research  areas,  which  are 
not  mutually  exclusive:  from  the  design  of  novel  hash

functions and symmetric algorithms [40] to the optimiza­
tion of existing primitives [41]. 

3.3.4. Privacy 

Up to this point we have seen that a distributed IoT archi­
tecture requires more complex security mechanisms. There 
is, however, one area where distributed IoTs provide immedi­
ate beneﬁts: Data management and privacy. The core idea is 
that, due to the edge intelligence principle, every entity has 
more control over the data it generates and processes. There 
are several consequences of this approach. Firstly, entities 
can  control  the  granularity  of  the  data  they  produce.  For 
example, a portable radiation sensor can announce that it 
is located in a certain area without providing its exact coor­
dinates. Secondly, entities can deﬁne their own access poli­
cies. The previously mentioned object can provide the city 
where it is located (Tokyo) to anonymous entities, the area 
where it is deployed (Shibuya, Tokyo) to entities with ade­
quate permissions, or even detailed GPS location informa­
tion  to  local  entities  in  case  of  emergencies.  Thirdly, 
entities do not need to provide all the data they produce, 
only the data that is needed by the external entities for a par­
ticular service. This is closely related to privacy, as it will be 
more difﬁcult to create a proﬁle of a certain entity if not all 
information is available. 

As for centralized IoT architectures (including those who 
comply  with  the  collaboration  principle),  a  data  provider 
can  also  decide  whether  to  share  or  not  a  particular data 
stream. Still, as the intelligence is located on the central en­
tity, the type of services it provides will be limited to the 
amount of data it receives. Another approach can be used 
if the centralized architecture complies with the edge intel­
ligence  principle:  as  data  providers  and  information  con­
sumers  are  able  to  communicate  directly,  they  might 
negotiate a set of secret keys in order to protect their infor­
mation. However, in this case the central entity cannot pro­
cess  the  data,  thus  it  becomes  a  simple  storage  system 
unless it implements advanced cryptographic mechanisms 
that can manipulate encrypted data, such as homomorphic 
encryption. 

As a ﬁnal note, we have to point out that the previous 
paragraphs  focus  mainly  on  the  protection  of  personal 
information, but there is another dimension of privacy that 
is  especially  relevant  in  the  context  of  the  IoT:  the  exis­
tence of entities that proﬁle and track users without their 
consent. Here, the beneﬁts of a distributed IoT might turn 
into  nightmares  when  misused.  By  following  the  edge 
intelligence  principle,  entities  can  adapt  their  behavior 
and track users more effectively. Moreover, thanks to the 
collaboration principle, these entities can share up-to-date 
information about the target. 

3.3.4.1. Promising approaches.  The distributed IoT approach 
facilitates  the  implementation  of  the  privacy-by-design 
principles  [24],  as  all  entities  can  directly  manage  their 
own data. However, it is necessary to go beyond the imple­
mentation of user-centric access policies and mechanisms 
to control the granularity of the provided data. Whenever 
human beings are involved, aspects such as the usability of 
the user interface (e.g. what can be accessed and to what ex­
tent [42]) should be taken into account. As data will be dis­

tributed  amongst  various  entities,  it  also  is  necessary  to 
study  the  applicability  of  existing  privacy-preserving  dis­
tributed data mining algorithms [43]. For example, certain 
privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) [44] such as multi­
party computations [45] can be used to provide protection 
to some cooperative protocols (e.g. cooperative benchmark­
ing and forecasting). For especially sensitive data, advanced 
concepts such as active bundles (i.e. a container with a pay­
load of sensitive data, metadata, and a virtual machine (VM) 
[46])  might be  used. Finally, the legal  privacy regulations 
should be revised to fully consider the intricacies of an al­
ways connected Internet of Things [47]. 

Regarding  the  problem  of  user  tracking  and  proﬁling, 
there are some ongoing efforts in the research community 
that aim to provide solutions for this particular threat. For 
example, there is an interesting perspective that considers 
a local environment as an operative system [48]. In short, 
incoming and outgoing items need to be scanned for rogue 
devices and malicious software that can threaten the pri­
vacy  of  the  user.  This  can  be  achieved  by  using  mecha­
nisms  such  as  the  privacy  coach  [49].  However,  as  users 
could  be  tracked  anywhere  and  anytime,  these  concepts 
should be extended in order to help users to become more 
aware  of  how  their  surroundings  capture  and  use  their 
information.  Frameworks  like  uTRUSTit  (cf.  Section  3.3.5) 
might help in this area. Besides, existing studies on surveil­
lance systems such as CCTVs [50] might also provide a clue 
on  the  speciﬁc  legal  challenges  that  our  society  will  face 
once the Internet of Things becomes a reality. 

3.3.5. Trust and governance 

There  are  other  areas  where  both  centralized  and  dis­
tributed  IoT  approaches  have  their  own  speciﬁc  advanta­
ges  and  disadvantages.  One  of  those  areas  is  Trust 
Management.  As  aforementioned,  in  the  IoT  we  can  con­
sider two dimensions of trust: trust in the interactions be­
tween  entities,  and  trust  in  the  system  from  the  users’ 
perspective.  In  a  centralized  IoT,  uncertainty  comes  from 
the  interactions  with  the  data  providers  (‘Which  data  is 
more reliable  and  fresh?’). The  holistic  point of  view  of  a 
central  entity  can  help  in  calculating  the  reputation  of 
other entities (e.g. a radiation sensor cannot give a warning 
if all sensors in the vicinity provide a low value). However, 
if  different  central  entities  collaborate  with  each  other, 
they must be able to exchange trust information in order 
to ﬁx inconsistencies in the reputation values. In a distrib­
uted IoT, there is uncertainty in both the interactions with 
the  data  providers  and  the  interactions  with  the  service 
providers (‘Who can give me a robust and timely service?’). 
The  distributed  infrastructure  makes  the  management  of 
trust more complicated: how can reputation and trust be 
calculated and shared? Which ontology should I use? Can 
I  trust  the  reports  from  other  systems?  Still,  these  trust 
management systems can make better use of second-hand 
information sources: when a certain entity is given a low 
reputation, this reputation can be propagated to other enti­
ties that might interact with such an outlier in the future. 
As for the trust in the system, it is largely dependant on 
knowing  the  internal  state  of  the  Internet  of  Things  that 
surround  us.  In  a  centralized  IoT  not  all  information  will 
be available: in order to provide services, a central entity

is more interested in retrieving physical and entity data in­
stead of status and network data. Still, if a centralized sys­
tem provides an additional ‘internal status’ service, it can 
be  able  to  supply  this  kind  of  information  very  quickly, 
as  (a)  it  stores  internally  most  of  the  information  from 
the data providers and (b) if fresh data is not available, it 
can send immediate queries to the speciﬁc data providers. 
As for a distributed IoT, this kind of service is more complex 
and  needs  more  time  to  be  completed,  as  relevant  data 
providers  must  be  discovered  and  queried.  Nevertheless, 
the more intelligence at the edge of the network, the more 
relevant information (e.g. network status, existing connec­
tions between entities) that can be retrieved. This way, it 
can be possible to have a more accurate picture of the sta­
tus of the whole system. 

Regarding  the  issues  associated  with  Governance,  it  is 
not clear how this problem will be solved in the context of 
the IoT [51], although the distributed IoT approach can pro­
vide some solutions. As policies in a distributed IoT can be 
deﬁned at the edge of the network, it could be possible to 
implement  and  enforce  certain  rules  such  as  limiting  the 
countries that can access to our data. This is not possible 
in a centralized system, whose data servers will be located 
in most cases in foreign countries. Still, as with many other 
security mechanisms, a distributed IoT needs to implement 
various  distributed  mechanisms  to  control  and  enforce 
these policies, which is not trivial. This same problem affects 
the management of accountability in the IoT. As logging sub­
systems will be distributed throughout the network, it will 
be more difﬁcult to retrieve all the relevant information that 
might be needed for forensic analysis. There is one clear ben­
eﬁt, though: if a balance between accountability and privacy 
is achieved, it will be possible to pinpoint the source of a par­
ticular problem thanks to the detailed information about the 
behavior of the system. 

3.3.5.1.  Promising  approaches.  There  are  some  theoretical 
studies  that  analyze  the  suitability  of  trust  management 
systems for the IoT. For example, Køien [52] points out that 
subjective logic systems such as TNA-SL [53] can capture dy­
namic  environments  where  beliefs  and  uncertainties 
change over time. There are other open issues that the state 
of the art needs to address, such as the management of trust 
without central authorities. Still, it might be possible to de­
velop preliminary solutions for such problems by analyzing 
how they are solved in the building blocks of the Internet of 
Things (e.g. sensor networks, ad hoc networks). The reason 
is  simple:  these  building  blocks  have  several  features  in 
common  with  the  distributed  IoT  approach.  For  example, 
ad hoc networks are dynamic environments where the net­
work is created, operated and managed by the nodes them­
selves. In such networks, the decentralization of trust, which 
is essential in a distributed IoT context, has been extensively 
studied [54]. Moreover, there are other holistic paradigms 
closely related  to  the  Internet  of  Things, such  as  ambient 
intelligence  and  pervasive  computing,  whose  existing 
works in the area might also provide additional information 
on how to deal with multidisciplinary challenges [55]. 

All the previous approaches do not consider the interac­
tions between human beings and IoT entities. In fact, as the 
Internet  of  Things  can  (and  will)  contain  user-generated 

content, we also have to ask ourselves how to model this 
type  of  trust.  One  promising  approach  is  the  existence  of 
user-managed  circles  of  trust,  as  described  in  the  shop­
pingLense system by Robinson et al. [56]. This system in­
creases  users’  trust  in  the  IoT  by  including  trusted 
metadata  in  the  information  ﬂow.  In  particular,  patterns 
(e.g. QR  codes) located in the environment (e.g.  shopping 
mall)  are  digitally  signed  and  owned  by  a  user-deﬁned 
group. Members of that group can also add ratings to a par­
ticular pattern. This way, if a user trusts a particular group, 
it  can  acquire  both  information  from  the  pattern  and 
trusted  ratings  from  other  users.  Finally,  regarding  the 
trust in the system from the users’ perspective, one partic­
ular research project (uTRUSTit [57]) has already produced 
promising results in this area. In particular, the framework 
developed in this project not only provides an inventory of 
the  local  devices  that  are  connected  to  the  Internet  of 
Things, but also enables users to know their status, allow­
ing the creation of a mental model of the virtual world. 

3.3.6. Fault tolerance 

Regardless  of  the  approach,  centralized  or  distributed, 
there  is  an  expected  population  of  billions  of  things  that 
will  act  as  data  and  information  providers.  Such  things 
can  become  faulty  and  stop  working,  but  they  also  can 
send  bogus  or  even  manipulated  data.  As  mentioned  in 
Section 3.2, it is unrealistic to assume that a data process­
ing  entity  will  never  have  to  deal  with  such  problematic 
data. Therefore, in the IoT context, it is essential to consider 
fault tolerance. We must not only aim to provide a ‘best-ef­
fort’ service in case parts of the network are not accessible, 
but also assume that every entity can receive bogus infor­
mation from other entities. 

In case one of the things fails and stops sending data, it 
is  necessary  to  discover  another  thing  that  can  provide  a 
similar set of data. In centralized IoT architectures this task 
is  more  simple,  as  the  central  entity  will  have  access  to 
all data ﬂows. As for distributed IoT architectures, they need 
to develop a discovery mechanism that is able to pinpoint 
related data ﬂows. Note that additional mechanisms need 
to  be  implemented  in  order  to  assure  the  survivability of 
the  network  in  case  of  a  failure  of  part  of  the  infrastruc­
ture: not only data providers need to be located, but also 
service providers and data processing entities as well. 

As for the existence of bogus data, it is possible to devel­
op holistic (centralized) and detailed (distributed) mecha­
nisms that deal with this problem. A centralized system can 
analyze the consistency of the data, pinpointing data pro­
viders who seem to behave erratically. A distributed system 
can  make  use  of  the  additional  information  (e.g.  network 
information) retrieved at a local level or in the interactions 
with other  entities to  apply  advanced intrusion detection 
systems.  Both  approaches  have  their  own  challenges,  but 
they are not mutually exclusive (e.g. in a distributed envi­
ronment there can be certain entities that provide high-le­
vel 
IoT 
infrastructures), thus it is advisable to take full advantage 
of both of them if possible.

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­

receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

into the Internet of Things, have been already enumerated 
by the research community [3,22,23]. They are as follows: 

•  Heterogeneity  has  a  great  inﬂuence  over  the  protocol 
and  network  security  services  that  must  be  imple­
mented  in  the  IoT.  Constrained  devices  will  interact 
with  various  heterogeneous  devices  (e.g.  other  con­
strained  devices,  full-ﬂedged  web  servers)  either 
directly or through gateways. In this scenario, not only 
it is essential to implement efﬁcient cryptographic algo­
rithms that can provide a high throughput even in 8-bit 
or 16-bit devices, but also to adapt or create lightweight 
security protocols that offer an end-to-end secure com­
munication  channel.  These  protocols  require  creden­
tials,  thus  optimal  key  management  systems  must  be 
implemented to distribute these credentials and to help 
in  establishing  the  necessary  session  keys  between 
peers. 

•  The existence of billions of heterogeneous objects also 
affects  identity  management.  Beyond  deﬁning  the 
actual scope of ‘identity’ in this context (e.g. underlying 
identity  vs.  real  identity,  core  identity  vs.  temporary 
identity),  we  also  need  to  provide  some  mechanisms 
for achieving universal authentication. Without authen­
tication,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  assure  that  the  data 
ﬂow  produced  by  a  certain  entity  contains  what  it  is 
supposed to contain. Another important aspect related 
to  authentication  is  authorization.  If  there  is  no  access 
control  whatsoever,  everything  will  be  accessed  by 
everyone, which is neither viable nor realistic. 

•  In fact, the data deluge caused by billions of entities cre­
ating information is a big threat to privacy. Users must 
have tools that allow them to retain their anonymity in 
this superconnected world. Other tools must provide a 
snapshot  of  the  information  and  policies  surrounding 
a particular user, enabling transparency and preventing 
the notion that the IoT is silently controlling our lives. 
In fact, the IoT itself must seriously consider the imple­
mentation of the privacy by design principles [24], pro­
viding  user-centric  support  for  security  and  privacy 
from its very own foundations. 

•  The  size  and  heterogeneity  of  the  IoT  also  affects  its 
trust  and  governance.  There  are  actually  two  dimen­
sions of trust: (a) trust in the interaction between enti­
ties, where we have to deal with uncertainty about the 
future actions of all collaborating entities, and (b) trust 
in  the  system  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  user,  as 
users must be able to manage their things so as to not 
feel  under  some  unknown  external  control.  Regarding 
governance,  it  is  a  double-edged  sword  that  must  be 
wielded with care. On the  one hand, it offers  stability, 
support  for  political  decisions,  and  the  possibility  to 
deﬁne common frameworks and interoperability mech­
anisms.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily 
become  excessive, 
fostering  an  over-controlled 
environment. 

•  The number of vulnerable systems and attacks vectors 
will surely increase in the context of the IoT, thus fault 
tolerance  becomes  essential.  Not  only  we  must  strive 
for  security  by  default  (robust  implementations,  usable 
systems,  etc.)  in  the  IoT,  but  also  we  need  to  develop 

awareness  mechanisms  that  can  be  used  to  create  the 
foundations of intrusion detection and prevention mecha­
nisms,  which  will  help  IoT  entities  to  protect  or  even 
gracefully  degrade  their  services.  Finally,  recovery  ser­
vices  must  be  able  to  locate  unsafe  zones  (i.e.  zones 
affected  by  attacks)  and  redirect  the  functionality  of 
the systems to other trusted zones. 

3.2. Analysis of attacker models and threats 

As aforementioned, in order to understand how the dif­
ferent  approaches  presented  in  Section  2.2  should  be  se­
cured  in  the  future,  it  is  ﬁrstly  necessary  to  enumerate 
and analyze the attacker models. These models have been 
deﬁned in a way that they can be applied to both central­
ized  and  distributed  IoT  approaches.  Note,  however,  that 
the  concept  of  ‘perimeter’  in  the  Internet  of  Things  is  a 
bit  fuzzy:  an  attacker  can  control  part  of  the  network, 
but due to the inherent distributed nature of the IoT, it is 
nearly impossible for an attacker to fully control the whole 
system. As a result, an attacker can be both ‘internal’ and 
‘external’ at the same time. These attacker models, catego­
rized by threats, are introduced in the following paragraph. 

•  Denial  of  service  (DoS).  There are a wide number of DoS 
attacks that can be launched against the IoT. Beyond tradi­
tional Internet DoS attacks that exhaust service provider 
resources  and  network  bandwidth,  the  actual  wireless 
communication  infrastructure  of  most  data  acquisition 
networks can also be targeted (e.g. jamming the channels). 
Malicious internal attackers that take control of part of the 
infrastructure can create even more mayhem. 

•  Physical damage. This threat can be seen as a subset of 
the DoS threat. In this attacker model, active attackers 
usually lack  technical  knowledge, and  can  only hinder 
the provisioning of IoT services by destroying the actual 
‘things’.  This  is  a  realistic  attack  in  the  IoT  context, 
because  things  might  be  easily  accessible  to  anyone 
(e.g.  a  street  light).  If  that  is  not  possible,  the  attacker 
can simply target the hardware module in charge of cre­
ating the ‘virtual persona’ of the thing. 

•  Eavesdropping. Passive attackers can target various com­
munication channels (e.g. wireless networks, local wired 
networks,  Internet)  in  order  to  extract  data  from  the 
information  ﬂow.  Obviously,  an  internal  attacker  that 
gains  access  to  a  particular  infrastructure  will  be  able 
to  extract  the  information  that  circulates  within  that 
infrastructure. 

•  Node Capture. As aforementioned, things (e.g. household 
appliances, street lights) are physically located in a cer­
tain environment. Instead of destroying them, an active 
attacker can try to extract the information they contain. 
Note  also  that,  instead  of  things,  active  attackers  can 
also target other infrastructures that store information, 
such as data processing or data storage entities. 

•  Controlling.  As  long  as  there  is  an  attack  path,  active 
attackers can try to gain partial or full control over an 
IoT  entity.  The  scope  of  the  damage  caused  by  these 
attackers depends mainly on (a) the importance of the 
data managed by that particular entity, (b) the services 
that are provided by that particular entity.

While  both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches 
share  the  same  attacker  models,  there  are  subtle  differ­
ences caused by the distributed IoT features and principles. 
They change various aspects of the underlying infrastruc­
tures,  such  as  the  deployment  strategies  of  the  different 
IoT entities, the actual information ﬂow, and the availabil­
ity of certain interfaces and services. Such changes can cre­
ate  new  threats  and  facilitate  the  work  of  attackers,  but 
also can reduce the effectiveness of certain attack vectors. 
In  the  following  paragraphs  we  will  discuss  the  different 
aspects that are inﬂuenced by the distributed IoT features 
and  principles,  and  how  they  impact  the  threats  and  at­
tacker models. 

One aspect is the centralization of resources. Most adver­
saries will aim to target systems that provide the biggest 
payoff, and central entities fall under this category – they 
store, manage, and process a huge amount of information. 
Theoretically, these central entities will have better protec­
tion  mechanisms,  but  any  vulnerability  can  make  the 
whole  system  fall  apart.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  actual 
intelligence  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  distributed,  the 
information will be created and processed in different enti­
ties, thus adversaries need to redouble their efforts in order 
to control the same amount of resources. However, the dis­
tribution  of  resources  is  a  double-edged  sword.  If  the 
adversary is only interested in a speciﬁc piece of informa­
tion, it can target the system that manages that particular 
information – which might not be as protected as a central 
entity. Besides, node capture attacks become more danger­
ous, as more logic is placed within the things themselves. 
In  fact,  an  adversary  can  use  a  guerrilla  warfare  strategy 
and  gradually  take  control  of  small  parts  of  the  network, 
so as to affect the whole system in a covert way. 

Another aspect, related to the centralization of resources, 
is  the  nature  of  the  information  ﬂow.  In  centralized  IoT 
deployments, the information ﬂow will follow a hierarchical 
pattern,  as  a  central  entity  will  receive  information  from 
every  ‘thing’.  On  the  other  hand,  in  more  distributed  ap­
proaches, the information ﬂow will resemble a peer-to-peer 
system, where information is only exchanged when needed. 
In  this  particular case, an  adversary  that  eavesdrops  on  a 
section of the network will not be able to obtain a holistic 
point of view of the whole system. There is a caveat here: 
if an adversary targets an intranet of things (e.g. an IoT-en­
abled hospital) in a distributed scenario, he might be able 
to retrieve processed information instead of raw data. 

Regarding the overall connectivity of the network, in ap­
proaches  that  follow  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  con­
strained entities are expected to be directly locatable and 
addressable via the Internet. Therefore, they must be able 
to accept connections from external entities. This situation 
allows  malicious  adversaries  to  launch  attacks  that  can 
easily exhaust their resources. Observe that this situation 
can  also  arise  in  networks  (either  centralized  or  distrib­
uted)  with  actuators  (e.g.  electric  motors,  industrial 
machinery), as the behavior of actuators can change when 
receiving  orders  from  remote  administrators.  Note  also 
that  it  is  possible  to  implement  additional  protection 
mechanisms  to  control  these  incoming  connections,  such 
as ﬁrewalls and additional middleware layers. 

Finally, we also have to consider the user involvement in 
the conﬁguration of the security mechanisms. User-centric 
networks, such as personal area networks [18], are one of 
the  elements  of  the  Internet  of  Things.  By  pushing  the 
intelligence  onto  the  edge  of  the  network,  it  is  possible 
for  the  owners  of  these  networks  to  create  and  manage 
their  own  policies  (cf.  Section  3.3.4).  However,  as  most 
users are not experts, mistakes will happen if the security 
mechanisms  are  not  usable  enough.  Such  misconﬁgura­
tions  can  be  exploited  by  malicious  adversaries  to  access 
personal data or even take control of that particular user-
centric network. Note that in centralized entities the con­
ﬁguration of the security mechanisms will be made by ex­
perts,  but  any  misconﬁguration  will  create  a  very 
rewarding  window  of  opportunity  that  can  be  exploited 
by any knowledgeable adversary. 

By  reviewing  these  attacker  models,  we  can  conclude 
that no approach is better in terms of threats and attacker 
models – all  of  them have  various advantages and disad­
vantages.  In  a  centralized  IoT  the  central  entity  becomes 
a single point of failure; and although the number of attack 
vectors are smaller (and the protection mechanisms might 
be better), a single vulnerability or a misconﬁguration can 
cause  extreme  damage  to  the  whole  network.  If  the  re­
sources of the network are distributed, the impact caused 
by a successful attack will be smaller, but the number of at­
tack vectors will increase. Note that in all approaches there 
will  be  a  huge  number  of  data  providers, the  things,  that 
can  be  highly  constrained  and  physically  accessible  –  in 
other  words,  easy  targets.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  any 
IoT application will have to deal with a certain amount of 
bogus data. 

3.3. Speciﬁc challenges and promising solutions 

Once the analysis of the threats and attacker models is 
ﬁnished, we can study what are the main challenges in the 
design and deployment of the security mechanisms. Such 
study,  which  will  be  performed  in  the  next  sections,  will 
help  to  point  out  speciﬁc  problems  that  must  be  consid­
ered if we want to bring the distributed IoT architectures 
to the real world. Moreover, within this study, we will ex­
plore not only existing IoT security mechanisms,  but also 
promising approaches that could be used to provide secu­
rity in a distributed IoT environment. 

3.3.1. Identity and authentication 

It  is  essential  to  consider  how  to  manage  identity and 
authentication in the Internet of Things, as multiple enti­
ties (e.g. data sources, service providers, information pro­
cessing systems) need to authenticate each other in order 
to create trustable services [25]. When deﬁning these secu­
rity  mechanisms,  we  also  have  to  consider  some  of  the 
inherent features of the Internet of Things. As interactions 
can  be  quite  dynamic,  the  entities  of  the  network  might 
not even know in advance which partners can be used to 
create  a  certain  service.  Vehicular  networks  (VANETs 
[26]) are an example of this: cars are expected to provide 
data  not  only  to  devices  located  on  the  roadside  but  also 
to other cars. Besides, if billions of things are going to be

interconnected, it is necessary to manage their identities in 
a scalable way. 

In a centralized IoT architecture, some of these challenges 
are inherently more simple. In this particular approach, the 
application  logic  is  mainly  located  in  one  central  entity 
(e.g. a cloud-based IoT application platform) that provides 
a  limited  set  of  well-known entry  points  (e.g.  APIs).  Both 
data providers, such as sensors, and information consum­
ers, such as user applications and other customers, connect 
to this central entity. As a consequence, all the authentica­
tion logic can be centralized in this entity or in an identity 
provider associated with it. In case there are data providers 
that have their own identity provider, there are no scalabil­
ity  problems,  as  such  identity  providers  can  establish  a 
relationship of trust with the central entity (a N-to-1 sce­
nario). Note that if an IoT complies with the collaboration 
principle (Collaborative IoT), it might be possible to make 
use  of  a  federated  identity  management  system,  where 
all the service providers belong to the same circle of trust. 
This simpliﬁcation cannot be found in purely distributed 
IoT  architectures,  which  fulﬁll  both  the  collaboration  and 
edge intelligence principles. In  this context  we ﬁnd  a dy­
namic N-to-N scenario, where data providers are no longer 
passive  and  are  able  to  acquire  and  process  information 
from other sources. Moreover, due to the edge intelligence 
principle, local users can query local information providers 
directly, without intervention from external entities. As a 
result, some kind of authentication logic must be present 
in every service provider – including the tiniest of objects. 
Note, however, that things do not exist in a vacuum: they 
usually belong to a speciﬁc group, are located in a particu­
lar  context,  and  are  owned  by  certain  entities.  These  as­
pects must be taken into account. 

3.3.1.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  aforementioned,  it  is 
essential to  manage  the  identities  of  the  things in  a  scal­
able  way.  However,  as  of  2012,  there  are  various  mecha­
nisms  that  can  be  used  to  identify  things  uniquely,  such 
as  the  tag  code  standards  EPC  and  ucode  [27].  Therefore, 
it is expected that in the future various systems will coex­
ist – not only at the universal level but also at a local scale 
[28].  Note,  however,  that  in  many  scenarios  the  ‘who’  is 
less important than the ‘where’ and the ‘what’. As a conse­
quence, things should be able to identify themselves using 
their  attributes  and  their  context  (e.g.  radiation  sensor 
#2044A can simply state that is a radiation sensor located 
in Shibuya, Tokyo). 

Regarding  things  authentication,  we  have  to  consider 
that  in  many  scenarios  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(e.g. intranets of things, personal area networks) located in 
the same spatial area (e.g. IoT-enabled hospitals). In such 
environments, local identity providers can manage the iden­
tities of those things, and also can create a circle of trust with 
relevant external resource providers (e.g. the household of a 
chronic patient, other hospitals). Consequently, local enti­
ties are not only able to authenticate to each other within 
the  group,  but  also  can  provide  a  proof  of  identity  when 
interacting  with  external  entities.  Also,  external  entities 
can  receive  a  temporary  persona  (e.g.  long-term  patient) 
from  the  local  identity  provider  if  necessary.  This  group-
based strategy has been, in fact, partially considered in the 

interactions between WSN islands, where interdomain col­
laboration is possible through federated identity manage­
ment and  access  tokens translation [29].  Traditional Web 
2.0 SSO such as OpenID and Shibboleth could also be used 
in this situation, although it should be noted that they were 
not designed to fulﬁll certain IoT requirements such as iden­
tity disclosure (i.e. support for privacy) [30], thus more anal­
yses are needed. 

If the thing is actually a human being, it can also be pos­
sible to use existing authentication mechanisms (e.g. web 
credentials,  electronic  identity  cards)  if  the  resource  pro­
vider  understands  them.  For  example,  Guinard  et  al.  [31] 
proposed  a  smart  gateway  infrastructure  (Social  Access 
Controller, or SAC) that allows users to retrieve data from 
local sensors using their social network (e.g. Facebook) cre­
dentials.  Note  that  this  approach  might  not  work  in  case 
the  human  being  does  not  directly  interact  with  the  IoT 
entities. In such cases, it is necessary to develop surrogate 
mechanisms  that  can  act  on  behalf  of  the  human  users. 
One existing example is the concept of the Minimal Entity 
(ME) [32] – a device that stores the digital identity of the 
user  and  acts  as  his  representative  in  the  virtual  world. 
Not only it does provide end-to-end secure communication 
and  collaboration  with  anonymous  receivers,  but  also  al­
lows  the  implementation  of  pseudonyms.  Another  exam­
ple  is  the  concept  of  a  digital  shadow  [33],  where  users 
can  delegate  their  credentials  (including  access  control 
credentials) to multiple objects or virtual entities. 

3.3.2. Access control 

In the Internet of Things, the challenges related to Access 
Control are closely related to those found in any distributed 
system. A particular service is constructed by aggregating 
several services and data sources from different locations 
and  contexts  (e.g.  a  hospital  retrieving  information  from 
home patients and ambulances). All these information pro­
viders will have their own access control policies and per­
missions  whose 
(creation,  enforcement, 
maintenance, translation) needs to be managed. 

life  cycle 

There are also some speciﬁc issues that must be taken 
into account in the context of the IoT. Granularity (i.e. pro­
viding more information to people with the right creden­
tials)  and  location  (i.e.  checking  whether  users  are 
accessing  the  services  of  a  thing  locally  or  remotely)  be­
come important elements of the access control policies in 
certain  scenarios.  For  example,  in  case  of  an  accident, 
everyone at the crash site can access my blood group, but 
only certiﬁed doctors and nurses can access my vital signs. 
Also,  whenever  access  control  mechanisms  are  imple­
mented  at  the  thing  level,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the 
amount  of  computational  resources  that  are  available,  as 
constrained  devices  might  not  have  enough  space  to 
implement  a  complex  access  control  mechanism.  Finally, 
as  many  things  are  owned  by  their  users  (either  perma­
nently or temporarily) and may belong to a group (e.g. per­
sonal area network), it is necessary to consider the design 
of delegation mechanisms, as these things may act in the 
name of the user/group. 

As with authentication, access control policies are eas­
ier to manage in centralized IoT architectures: all access con­
trol policies are stored and managed within a single central

9 

entity. Therefore, data providers do not need to implement 
any kind of access control logic: they will send all their data 
to those whom they trust (i.e. the central entity). As a side 
effect of this conﬁguration, both data providers and infor­
mation consumers must completely trust the central entity, 
as  it  will  store  the  information  generated  by  all  network 
entities. On the other hand, purely distributed IoT architec­
tures have to deal with all previously mentioned challenges: 
management of heterogeneous policies, multiple enforce­
ment points, etc. Nevertheless, as will be mentioned in Sec­
tion 3.3.4, the overall privacy of the network improves once 
the things can control directly who accesses their own data. 
Observe  that  additional  mechanisms  must  be  imple­
mented  whenever  the  collaboration  principle  is  applied 
to centralized IoT architectures (e.g. tools for maintaining 
consistency between access control lists, resource delega­
tion  mechanisms).  Note  also  that  we  need  to  manually 
conﬁgure  the  direct  links  between  the  intranets  and  the 
external  entities  in  networks  that  only  comply  with  the 
edge intelligence principle. 

3.3.2.1. Promising approaches.  There have been very few ad­
vances  in  the  management  of  access  control  policies  for 
distributed IoTs. In fact, it is not trivial to apply existing ac­
cess control approaches to completely distributed environ­
ments.  For  example,  there  are  scalability  and  consistency 
issues  when  storing  the  list  of  users  and  their  associated 
access rights in access control lists (ACLs). Role-based ac­
cess control (RBAC) mechanisms need to deﬁne the differ­
ent roles that users can take, which might be different in 
various contexts even if they refer to the same type of en­
tity  (e.g. custodian vs. janitor).  Finally, RBAC policies that 
use attribute certiﬁcates [34] need of an infrastructure that 
allows validating such certiﬁcates in a cross-domain envi­
ronment. Note, however, that due to the speciﬁc features of 
the Internet of Things, it is possible to consider certain fac­
tors  such  as  context  as  part  of  the  access  control  model 
[35].  As a consequence, with adequate technological  sup­
port, certain policies (e.g. only authenticated users located 
within  my  vicinity  during  working  hours  can  access  to­
day’s reports) can be easily implemented. 

Besides,  there  are  various  simple  strategies  that  could 
be  used  whenever  the  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(cf.  Section  3.3.1).  For  example,  the  access  control  logic 
could  be  pushed  to  speciﬁc  trusted  entities,  which  will 
act as token-granting services à la Kerberos (i.e. a thing will 
grant access to anyone that has a valid signature created by 
a  trusted  entity).  In  another  approach,  the  access  control 
logic  can  be  implemented  within  the  things  themselves, 
but relying only on locally-deﬁned roles (e.g. a doctor from 
another  hospital  must  retrieve  his  locally-issued  role  be­
fore  interacting  with  the  local  things).  A  drawback  of  all 
these strategies is that users must ﬁrst access the trusted 
entity before requesting information from the things. 

3.3.3. Protocol and network security 

A  secure  communications  channel  is,  in  most  cases,  a 
byproduct  of  a  successful  authentication  (e.g.  server 
authentication  or  mutual  authentication  using  protocols 
such  as  TLS/DTLS).  This  process  will  make  use  of  certain 
user credentials, such as shared keys or X.509 certiﬁcates. 

If there is a limited set of well-known centralized applica­
tion  providers  (i.e.  central  entities),  the  distribution  and 
management  of  these  credentials  becomes  easier,  as  it  is 
possible  to  preload  information  in  the  devices.  However, 
in  distributed  IoT  architectures,  extra  challenges  arise:  any 
entity can connect with any other entity at any time, these 
entities  might  not  know  each  other  in  advance,  and  also 
limited devices can exchange information with other lim­
ited  devices.  Therefore,  in  this  scenario  key  management 
becomes a signiﬁcant problem. 

There are some additional challenges related to the com­
putational resources available to things. When opening a se­
cure channel, devices should be able to negotiate the actual 
parameters of that channel, such as algorithms (e.g. RSA vs. 
ECC), strength (AES-128 vs. AES-256), and protection mech­
anisms (only integrity vs. conﬁdentiality and integrity). The 
ﬁrst  reason  is  obvious:  constrained  devices  might  not  be 
able to implement certain conﬁgurations. There is another 
reason, though: adaptability. Depending on various factors 
such as the level of criticality of the data, it might not be nec­
essary to apply strong protection mechanisms to a particu­
lar  information  ﬂow  (e.g.  conﬁdentiality  and  the  on/off 
status of a street light). Another challenge is the need to ana­
lyze  the  number  of  security  protocols  that  can  be  imple­
mented within a constrained device. In fact, it is necessary 
to  carefully  study  whether  existing  Internet  protocols 
should be adapted to this context or not. Finally, things that 
can  be  accessed  directly  (e.g.  in  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach)  need  to  be  careful about  the  overhead caused by 
incoming connections (e.g. multiple incoming connections 
that require the use of public key cryptography). 

3.3.3.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  the  Internet  of  Things 
inhabits the Internet ecosystem, it is important to provide 
support for existing security protocols. In fact, the security 
of IoT-designed web transfer protocols, such as CoAP (Con­
strained Application Protocol), is largely dependant on the 
implementation of these security protocols [36]. Some pro­
tocols can be implemented without any major changes. For 
example, there are commercial implementations available 
of DTLS for constrained devices [37]. However, other proto­
cols need to be adapted due to the complexity of their de­
sign.  Such  protocols  must  achieve  a  tradeoff  between 
simplicity  and  compatibility.  For  example,  one  approach 
seeks  to  apply  IPsec  to  constrained  environments by  bal­
ancing  link-layer  security  and  IPsec  security  (cf.  Raza 
et al. [38]). 

As for the distribution of the credentials, there are var­
ious strategies that could be used to tackle this problem. As 
aforementioned  (cf.  Sections  3.3.1  and  3.3.2),  whenever 
things  belong  to  a  particular  local  group,  it  is  possible  to 
have one or various entities in charge of managing and dis­
tributing  the  credentials.  Also,  in  scenarios  where  clients 
and servers know each other in advance, it is also possible 
to  use  certain  symmetric  key-based  protocols,  which  can 
provide good properties such as high resilience to attacks 
[39].  Finally,  beyond  the  optimization  of  these  security 
protocols, there are various researchers that  are pursuing 
the  implementation  of  fast  and  compact  cryptographic 
algorithms.  There  are  various  research  areas,  which  are 
not  mutually  exclusive:  from  the  design  of  novel  hash

functions and symmetric algorithms [40] to the optimiza­
tion of existing primitives [41]. 

3.3.4. Privacy 

Up to this point we have seen that a distributed IoT archi­
tecture requires more complex security mechanisms. There 
is, however, one area where distributed IoTs provide immedi­
ate beneﬁts: Data management and privacy. The core idea is 
that, due to the edge intelligence principle, every entity has 
more control over the data it generates and processes. There 
are several consequences of this approach. Firstly, entities 
can  control  the  granularity  of  the  data  they  produce.  For 
example, a portable radiation sensor can announce that it 
is located in a certain area without providing its exact coor­
dinates. Secondly, entities can deﬁne their own access poli­
cies. The previously mentioned object can provide the city 
where it is located (Tokyo) to anonymous entities, the area 
where it is deployed (Shibuya, Tokyo) to entities with ade­
quate permissions, or even detailed GPS location informa­
tion  to  local  entities  in  case  of  emergencies.  Thirdly, 
entities do not need to provide all the data they produce, 
only the data that is needed by the external entities for a par­
ticular service. This is closely related to privacy, as it will be 
more difﬁcult to create a proﬁle of a certain entity if not all 
information is available. 

As for centralized IoT architectures (including those who 
comply  with  the  collaboration  principle),  a  data  provider 
can  also  decide  whether  to  share  or  not  a  particular data 
stream. Still, as the intelligence is located on the central en­
tity, the type of services it provides will be limited to the 
amount of data it receives. Another approach can be used 
if the centralized architecture complies with the edge intel­
ligence  principle:  as  data  providers  and  information  con­
sumers  are  able  to  communicate  directly,  they  might 
negotiate a set of secret keys in order to protect their infor­
mation. However, in this case the central entity cannot pro­
cess  the  data,  thus  it  becomes  a  simple  storage  system 
unless it implements advanced cryptographic mechanisms 
that can manipulate encrypted data, such as homomorphic 
encryption. 

As a ﬁnal note, we have to point out that the previous 
paragraphs  focus  mainly  on  the  protection  of  personal 
information, but there is another dimension of privacy that 
is  especially  relevant  in  the  context  of  the  IoT:  the  exis­
tence of entities that proﬁle and track users without their 
consent. Here, the beneﬁts of a distributed IoT might turn 
into  nightmares  when  misused.  By  following  the  edge 
intelligence  principle,  entities  can  adapt  their  behavior 
and track users more effectively. Moreover, thanks to the 
collaboration principle, these entities can share up-to-date 
information about the target. 

3.3.4.1. Promising approaches.  The distributed IoT approach 
facilitates  the  implementation  of  the  privacy-by-design 
principles  [24],  as  all  entities  can  directly  manage  their 
own data. However, it is necessary to go beyond the imple­
mentation of user-centric access policies and mechanisms 
to control the granularity of the provided data. Whenever 
human beings are involved, aspects such as the usability of 
the user interface (e.g. what can be accessed and to what ex­
tent [42]) should be taken into account. As data will be dis­

tributed  amongst  various  entities,  it  also  is  necessary  to 
study  the  applicability  of  existing  privacy-preserving  dis­
tributed data mining algorithms [43]. For example, certain 
privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) [44] such as multi­
party computations [45] can be used to provide protection 
to some cooperative protocols (e.g. cooperative benchmark­
ing and forecasting). For especially sensitive data, advanced 
concepts such as active bundles (i.e. a container with a pay­
load of sensitive data, metadata, and a virtual machine (VM) 
[46])  might be  used. Finally, the legal  privacy regulations 
should be revised to fully consider the intricacies of an al­
ways connected Internet of Things [47]. 

Regarding  the  problem  of  user  tracking  and  proﬁling, 
there are some ongoing efforts in the research community 
that aim to provide solutions for this particular threat. For 
example, there is an interesting perspective that considers 
a local environment as an operative system [48]. In short, 
incoming and outgoing items need to be scanned for rogue 
devices and malicious software that can threaten the pri­
vacy  of  the  user.  This  can  be  achieved  by  using  mecha­
nisms  such  as  the  privacy  coach  [49].  However,  as  users 
could  be  tracked  anywhere  and  anytime,  these  concepts 
should be extended in order to help users to become more 
aware  of  how  their  surroundings  capture  and  use  their 
information.  Frameworks  like  uTRUSTit  (cf.  Section  3.3.5) 
might help in this area. Besides, existing studies on surveil­
lance systems such as CCTVs [50] might also provide a clue 
on  the  speciﬁc  legal  challenges  that  our  society  will  face 
once the Internet of Things becomes a reality. 

3.3.5. Trust and governance 

There  are  other  areas  where  both  centralized  and  dis­
tributed  IoT  approaches  have  their  own  speciﬁc  advanta­
ges  and  disadvantages.  One  of  those  areas  is  Trust 
Management.  As  aforementioned,  in  the  IoT  we  can  con­
sider two dimensions of trust: trust in the interactions be­
tween  entities,  and  trust  in  the  system  from  the  users’ 
perspective.  In  a  centralized  IoT,  uncertainty  comes  from 
the  interactions  with  the  data  providers  (‘Which  data  is 
more reliable  and  fresh?’). The  holistic  point of  view  of  a 
central  entity  can  help  in  calculating  the  reputation  of 
other entities (e.g. a radiation sensor cannot give a warning 
if all sensors in the vicinity provide a low value). However, 
if  different  central  entities  collaborate  with  each  other, 
they must be able to exchange trust information in order 
to ﬁx inconsistencies in the reputation values. In a distrib­
uted IoT, there is uncertainty in both the interactions with 
the  data  providers  and  the  interactions  with  the  service 
providers (‘Who can give me a robust and timely service?’). 
The  distributed  infrastructure  makes  the  management  of 
trust more complicated: how can reputation and trust be 
calculated and shared? Which ontology should I use? Can 
I  trust  the  reports  from  other  systems?  Still,  these  trust 
management systems can make better use of second-hand 
information sources: when a certain entity is given a low 
reputation, this reputation can be propagated to other enti­
ties that might interact with such an outlier in the future. 
As for the trust in the system, it is largely dependant on 
knowing  the  internal  state  of  the  Internet  of  Things  that 
surround  us.  In  a  centralized  IoT  not  all  information  will 
be available: in order to provide services, a central entity

is more interested in retrieving physical and entity data in­
stead of status and network data. Still, if a centralized sys­
tem provides an additional ‘internal status’ service, it can 
be  able  to  supply  this  kind  of  information  very  quickly, 
as  (a)  it  stores  internally  most  of  the  information  from 
the data providers and (b) if fresh data is not available, it 
can send immediate queries to the speciﬁc data providers. 
As for a distributed IoT, this kind of service is more complex 
and  needs  more  time  to  be  completed,  as  relevant  data 
providers  must  be  discovered  and  queried.  Nevertheless, 
the more intelligence at the edge of the network, the more 
relevant information (e.g. network status, existing connec­
tions between entities) that can be retrieved. This way, it 
can be possible to have a more accurate picture of the sta­
tus of the whole system. 

Regarding  the  issues  associated  with  Governance,  it  is 
not clear how this problem will be solved in the context of 
the IoT [51], although the distributed IoT approach can pro­
vide some solutions. As policies in a distributed IoT can be 
deﬁned at the edge of the network, it could be possible to 
implement  and  enforce  certain  rules  such  as  limiting  the 
countries that can access to our data. This is not possible 
in a centralized system, whose data servers will be located 
in most cases in foreign countries. Still, as with many other 
security mechanisms, a distributed IoT needs to implement 
various  distributed  mechanisms  to  control  and  enforce 
these policies, which is not trivial. This same problem affects 
the management of accountability in the IoT. As logging sub­
systems will be distributed throughout the network, it will 
be more difﬁcult to retrieve all the relevant information that 
might be needed for forensic analysis. There is one clear ben­
eﬁt, though: if a balance between accountability and privacy 
is achieved, it will be possible to pinpoint the source of a par­
ticular problem thanks to the detailed information about the 
behavior of the system. 

3.3.5.1.  Promising  approaches.  There  are  some  theoretical 
studies  that  analyze  the  suitability  of  trust  management 
systems for the IoT. For example, Køien [52] points out that 
subjective logic systems such as TNA-SL [53] can capture dy­
namic  environments  where  beliefs  and  uncertainties 
change over time. There are other open issues that the state 
of the art needs to address, such as the management of trust 
without central authorities. Still, it might be possible to de­
velop preliminary solutions for such problems by analyzing 
how they are solved in the building blocks of the Internet of 
Things (e.g. sensor networks, ad hoc networks). The reason 
is  simple:  these  building  blocks  have  several  features  in 
common  with  the  distributed  IoT  approach.  For  example, 
ad hoc networks are dynamic environments where the net­
work is created, operated and managed by the nodes them­
selves. In such networks, the decentralization of trust, which 
is essential in a distributed IoT context, has been extensively 
studied [54]. Moreover, there are other holistic paradigms 
closely related  to  the  Internet  of  Things, such  as  ambient 
intelligence  and  pervasive  computing,  whose  existing 
works in the area might also provide additional information 
on how to deal with multidisciplinary challenges [55]. 

All the previous approaches do not consider the interac­
tions between human beings and IoT entities. In fact, as the 
Internet  of  Things  can  (and  will)  contain  user-generated 

content, we also have to ask ourselves how to model this 
type  of  trust.  One  promising  approach  is  the  existence  of 
user-managed  circles  of  trust,  as  described  in  the  shop­
pingLense system by Robinson et al. [56]. This system in­
creases  users’  trust  in  the  IoT  by  including  trusted 
metadata  in  the  information  ﬂow.  In  particular,  patterns 
(e.g. QR  codes) located in the environment (e.g.  shopping 
mall)  are  digitally  signed  and  owned  by  a  user-deﬁned 
group. Members of that group can also add ratings to a par­
ticular pattern. This way, if a user trusts a particular group, 
it  can  acquire  both  information  from  the  pattern  and 
trusted  ratings  from  other  users.  Finally,  regarding  the 
trust in the system from the users’ perspective, one partic­
ular research project (uTRUSTit [57]) has already produced 
promising results in this area. In particular, the framework 
developed in this project not only provides an inventory of 
the  local  devices  that  are  connected  to  the  Internet  of 
Things, but also enables users to know their status, allow­
ing the creation of a mental model of the virtual world. 

3.3.6. Fault tolerance 

Regardless  of  the  approach,  centralized  or  distributed, 
there  is  an  expected  population  of  billions  of  things  that 
will  act  as  data  and  information  providers.  Such  things 
can  become  faulty  and  stop  working,  but  they  also  can 
send  bogus  or  even  manipulated  data.  As  mentioned  in 
Section 3.2, it is unrealistic to assume that a data process­
ing  entity  will  never  have  to  deal  with  such  problematic 
data. Therefore, in the IoT context, it is essential to consider 
fault tolerance. We must not only aim to provide a ‘best-ef­
fort’ service in case parts of the network are not accessible, 
but also assume that every entity can receive bogus infor­
mation from other entities. 

In case one of the things fails and stops sending data, it 
is  necessary  to  discover  another  thing  that  can  provide  a 
similar set of data. In centralized IoT architectures this task 
is  more  simple,  as  the  central  entity  will  have  access  to 
all data ﬂows. As for distributed IoT architectures, they need 
to develop a discovery mechanism that is able to pinpoint 
related data ﬂows. Note that additional mechanisms need 
to  be  implemented  in  order  to  assure  the  survivability of 
the  network  in  case  of  a  failure  of  part  of  the  infrastruc­
ture: not only data providers need to be located, but also 
service providers and data processing entities as well. 

As for the existence of bogus data, it is possible to devel­
op holistic (centralized) and detailed (distributed) mecha­
nisms that deal with this problem. A centralized system can 
analyze the consistency of the data, pinpointing data pro­
viders who seem to behave erratically. A distributed system 
can  make  use  of  the  additional  information  (e.g.  network 
information) retrieved at a local level or in the interactions 
with other  entities to  apply  advanced intrusion detection 
systems.  Both  approaches  have  their  own  challenges,  but 
they are not mutually exclusive (e.g. in a distributed envi­
ronment there can be certain entities that provide high-le­
vel 
IoT 
infrastructures), thus it is advisable to take full advantage 
of both of them if possible.

to  provide  service  survivability  in  the  IoT.  Still,  there  are 
various research approaches that can be used as a founda­
tion to enable such fault tolerance. For example, the tools 
that allow human users to create a mental model of their 
surroundings  (highlighted  in  Section  3.3.5)  can  also  be 
used  by  the  network  entities  to  discover  devices  that  are 
faulty. There are also various theoretical platforms whose 
aim is to provide service look-up, discovery and composi­
tion mechanisms for the Internet of Things [58]. However, 
it is necessary to study their applicability in an heteroge­
neous  distributed  environment.  The  use  of  local  clusters 
can  help  with  this  task:  if  entities  are  clustered  in  local 
groups, that cluster can incorporate mechanisms that not 
only  provide  up-to-date  information  about  local  things, 
but also enable the interaction of different service discov­
ery  protocols  through  specialized  middleware  [58].  Be­
sides, all these services can make use of the functionality 
provided  by  existing  security  mechanisms  such  as  trust 
management  (e.g.  only  reports  from  trusted  entities  will 
be  considered,  zones  with  high  reputation  will  take  care 
of the extra workload). 

Regarding  the  detection  of  bogus  data  and  malicious 
entities,  most  existing  intrusion  detection  mechanisms 
and  rules  focus  on  internal  adversaries  that  try  to  attack 
the speciﬁc protocols of data acquisition networks (e.g. sen­
sor networks) [59], but do not consider attacks that target 
the interactions between different IoT domains (e.g. a DoS 
attack or a malformed packet attack targeting a smart door 
service [60]). In fact, the state of the art on this speciﬁc area 
is very limited and only few works are available [61,62]. It is 
then  necessary  to  implement  new  detection  mechanisms 
that take into account the distributed IoT speciﬁc attacker 
models. Note that it is also possible, in certain scenarios, to 
adapt existing mechanisms. For example, centralized enti­
ties  can  make  use  of  clustering-based  mechanisms  and 
other data mining techniques to detect outliers and intru­
sions [63]. Moreover, lessons might be taken from existing 
distributed  intrusion  detection  systems  implemented  in 
similar environments such as smart grids [64]. 

3.4. Summary 

A summary of the challenges studied in the previous sec­
tions is shown in Table 2. We can conclude that the decen­
tralized  and  heterogeneous  nature  of  the  distributed 
approach increases the complexity of most security mecha­
nisms  (Identity  and  Authentication,  Access  Control,  Protocol 
and  Network  Security,  Trust  management  and  Fault  Toler­
ance).  Still,  there  are  some  security  mechanisms  (Privacy, 
Trust  management  and  Governance,  Fault  Tolerance)  where 

i)  the  distributed  approach  provides  interesting  features, 
ii) both approaches (centralized and distributed) can com­
plement each other. 

In the previous sections we have also highlighted various 
strategies that could be used in the near future to design and 
deploy IoT-speciﬁc security mechanisms. One such strategy 
assumes that things belong to a certain group (intranet of 
things, personal area network) located in a certain spatial 
area (IoT-enabled hospital, household). These groups com­
ply with the edge intelligence and collaboration principles, 
thus  they  are  part  of  the  distributed  IoT.  Once  the  things 
are grouped, the implementation of certain security mecha­
nisms becomes easier: local identity providers can be de­
ﬁned, the access control logic can be pushed onto speciﬁc 
entities, a mental model of the virtual world can be created, 
and so on. Note that this strategy might be partially applica­
ble to highly dynamic environments such as VANETs [26] if 
we consider the existence of logical groups (‘‘all cars that 
have  been  registered  in  Singapore’’),  although  more  re­
search is needed to validate this point of view. 

Other strategies focus on the interactions of human users 
with the  Internet  of Things.  For  example, as  digital social 
infrastructures  have  been  already  deployed,  they  can  be 
used in the implementation of speciﬁc security mechanisms 
such as user-deﬁned access control and circles of trust. Fi­
nally,  another  strategy  consists  of  adapting  the  security 
mechanisms  that  have  been  developed  in  i)  the  building 
blocks  of  the  Internet  of  Things  (e.g.  sensor  networks,  ad 
hoc  networks)  and  ii)  other  paradigms  closely  related  to 
the Internet of Things (ambient intelligence, pervasive com­
puting). Note that while the building blocks lack the com­
plexity of the distributed IoT approach, they share certain 
similarities such as the decentralization of resources. In fact, 
some security mechanisms, such as Key Management, have 
been successfully adapted to certain IoT scenarios [39]. 

4. Conclusions 

The main goal of this paper was to provide an explicit 
analysis of the features and security challenges of the dis­
tributed  approach  of  the  Internet  of  Things,  in  order  to 
understand what is its place in the Future Internet. There 
are numerous challenges that must be solved, such as assur­
ing interoperability, reaching a business model, and manag­
ing  the  authentication  and  authorization  of  entities.  Still, 
there are multiple beneﬁts as well. Since intelligence is not 
concentrated  on  a  limited  set  of  centralized  application 
platforms  –  although 
can  also 
exist in order to provide additional support – scalability is 
improved. Data is managed by the distributed entities, thus 

these  platforms

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

deployments. The purpose of this paper is to assess and an­
swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

into the Internet of Things, have been already enumerated 
by the research community [3,22,23]. They are as follows: 

•  Heterogeneity  has  a  great  inﬂuence  over  the  protocol 
and  network  security  services  that  must  be  imple­
mented  in  the  IoT.  Constrained  devices  will  interact 
with  various  heterogeneous  devices  (e.g.  other  con­
strained  devices,  full-ﬂedged  web  servers)  either 
directly or through gateways. In this scenario, not only 
it is essential to implement efﬁcient cryptographic algo­
rithms that can provide a high throughput even in 8-bit 
or 16-bit devices, but also to adapt or create lightweight 
security protocols that offer an end-to-end secure com­
munication  channel.  These  protocols  require  creden­
tials,  thus  optimal  key  management  systems  must  be 
implemented to distribute these credentials and to help 
in  establishing  the  necessary  session  keys  between 
peers. 

•  The existence of billions of heterogeneous objects also 
affects  identity  management.  Beyond  deﬁning  the 
actual scope of ‘identity’ in this context (e.g. underlying 
identity  vs.  real  identity,  core  identity  vs.  temporary 
identity),  we  also  need  to  provide  some  mechanisms 
for achieving universal authentication. Without authen­
tication,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  assure  that  the  data 
ﬂow  produced  by  a  certain  entity  contains  what  it  is 
supposed to contain. Another important aspect related 
to  authentication  is  authorization.  If  there  is  no  access 
control  whatsoever,  everything  will  be  accessed  by 
everyone, which is neither viable nor realistic. 

•  In fact, the data deluge caused by billions of entities cre­
ating information is a big threat to privacy. Users must 
have tools that allow them to retain their anonymity in 
this superconnected world. Other tools must provide a 
snapshot  of  the  information  and  policies  surrounding 
a particular user, enabling transparency and preventing 
the notion that the IoT is silently controlling our lives. 
In fact, the IoT itself must seriously consider the imple­
mentation of the privacy by design principles [24], pro­
viding  user-centric  support  for  security  and  privacy 
from its very own foundations. 

•  The  size  and  heterogeneity  of  the  IoT  also  affects  its 
trust  and  governance.  There  are  actually  two  dimen­
sions of trust: (a) trust in the interaction between enti­
ties, where we have to deal with uncertainty about the 
future actions of all collaborating entities, and (b) trust 
in  the  system  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  user,  as 
users must be able to manage their things so as to not 
feel  under  some  unknown  external  control.  Regarding 
governance,  it  is  a  double-edged  sword  that  must  be 
wielded with care. On the  one hand, it offers  stability, 
support  for  political  decisions,  and  the  possibility  to 
deﬁne common frameworks and interoperability mech­
anisms.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily 
become  excessive, 
fostering  an  over-controlled 
environment. 

•  The number of vulnerable systems and attacks vectors 
will surely increase in the context of the IoT, thus fault 
tolerance  becomes  essential.  Not  only  we  must  strive 
for  security  by  default  (robust  implementations,  usable 
systems,  etc.)  in  the  IoT,  but  also  we  need  to  develop 

awareness  mechanisms  that  can  be  used  to  create  the 
foundations of intrusion detection and prevention mecha­
nisms,  which  will  help  IoT  entities  to  protect  or  even 
gracefully  degrade  their  services.  Finally,  recovery  ser­
vices  must  be  able  to  locate  unsafe  zones  (i.e.  zones 
affected  by  attacks)  and  redirect  the  functionality  of 
the systems to other trusted zones. 

3.2. Analysis of attacker models and threats 

As aforementioned, in order to understand how the dif­
ferent  approaches  presented  in  Section  2.2  should  be  se­
cured  in  the  future,  it  is  ﬁrstly  necessary  to  enumerate 
and analyze the attacker models. These models have been 
deﬁned in a way that they can be applied to both central­
ized  and  distributed  IoT  approaches.  Note,  however,  that 
the  concept  of  ‘perimeter’  in  the  Internet  of  Things  is  a 
bit  fuzzy:  an  attacker  can  control  part  of  the  network, 
but due to the inherent distributed nature of the IoT, it is 
nearly impossible for an attacker to fully control the whole 
system. As a result, an attacker can be both ‘internal’ and 
‘external’ at the same time. These attacker models, catego­
rized by threats, are introduced in the following paragraph. 

•  Denial  of  service  (DoS).  There are a wide number of DoS 
attacks that can be launched against the IoT. Beyond tradi­
tional Internet DoS attacks that exhaust service provider 
resources  and  network  bandwidth,  the  actual  wireless 
communication  infrastructure  of  most  data  acquisition 
networks can also be targeted (e.g. jamming the channels). 
Malicious internal attackers that take control of part of the 
infrastructure can create even more mayhem. 

•  Physical damage. This threat can be seen as a subset of 
the DoS threat. In this attacker model, active attackers 
usually lack  technical  knowledge, and  can  only hinder 
the provisioning of IoT services by destroying the actual 
‘things’.  This  is  a  realistic  attack  in  the  IoT  context, 
because  things  might  be  easily  accessible  to  anyone 
(e.g.  a  street  light).  If  that  is  not  possible,  the  attacker 
can simply target the hardware module in charge of cre­
ating the ‘virtual persona’ of the thing. 

•  Eavesdropping. Passive attackers can target various com­
munication channels (e.g. wireless networks, local wired 
networks,  Internet)  in  order  to  extract  data  from  the 
information  ﬂow.  Obviously,  an  internal  attacker  that 
gains  access  to  a  particular  infrastructure  will  be  able 
to  extract  the  information  that  circulates  within  that 
infrastructure. 

•  Node Capture. As aforementioned, things (e.g. household 
appliances, street lights) are physically located in a cer­
tain environment. Instead of destroying them, an active 
attacker can try to extract the information they contain. 
Note  also  that,  instead  of  things,  active  attackers  can 
also target other infrastructures that store information, 
such as data processing or data storage entities. 

•  Controlling.  As  long  as  there  is  an  attack  path,  active 
attackers can try to gain partial or full control over an 
IoT  entity.  The  scope  of  the  damage  caused  by  these 
attackers depends mainly on (a) the importance of the 
data managed by that particular entity, (b) the services 
that are provided by that particular entity.

While  both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches 
share  the  same  attacker  models,  there  are  subtle  differ­
ences caused by the distributed IoT features and principles. 
They change various aspects of the underlying infrastruc­
tures,  such  as  the  deployment  strategies  of  the  different 
IoT entities, the actual information ﬂow, and the availabil­
ity of certain interfaces and services. Such changes can cre­
ate  new  threats  and  facilitate  the  work  of  attackers,  but 
also can reduce the effectiveness of certain attack vectors. 
In  the  following  paragraphs  we  will  discuss  the  different 
aspects that are inﬂuenced by the distributed IoT features 
and  principles,  and  how  they  impact  the  threats  and  at­
tacker models. 

One aspect is the centralization of resources. Most adver­
saries will aim to target systems that provide the biggest 
payoff, and central entities fall under this category – they 
store, manage, and process a huge amount of information. 
Theoretically, these central entities will have better protec­
tion  mechanisms,  but  any  vulnerability  can  make  the 
whole  system  fall  apart.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  actual 
intelligence  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  distributed,  the 
information will be created and processed in different enti­
ties, thus adversaries need to redouble their efforts in order 
to control the same amount of resources. However, the dis­
tribution  of  resources  is  a  double-edged  sword.  If  the 
adversary is only interested in a speciﬁc piece of informa­
tion, it can target the system that manages that particular 
information – which might not be as protected as a central 
entity. Besides, node capture attacks become more danger­
ous, as more logic is placed within the things themselves. 
In  fact,  an  adversary  can  use  a  guerrilla  warfare  strategy 
and  gradually  take  control  of  small  parts  of  the  network, 
so as to affect the whole system in a covert way. 

Another aspect, related to the centralization of resources, 
is  the  nature  of  the  information  ﬂow.  In  centralized  IoT 
deployments, the information ﬂow will follow a hierarchical 
pattern,  as  a  central  entity  will  receive  information  from 
every  ‘thing’.  On  the  other  hand,  in  more  distributed  ap­
proaches, the information ﬂow will resemble a peer-to-peer 
system, where information is only exchanged when needed. 
In  this  particular case, an  adversary  that  eavesdrops  on  a 
section of the network will not be able to obtain a holistic 
point of view of the whole system. There is a caveat here: 
if an adversary targets an intranet of things (e.g. an IoT-en­
abled hospital) in a distributed scenario, he might be able 
to retrieve processed information instead of raw data. 

Regarding the overall connectivity of the network, in ap­
proaches  that  follow  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  con­
strained entities are expected to be directly locatable and 
addressable via the Internet. Therefore, they must be able 
to accept connections from external entities. This situation 
allows  malicious  adversaries  to  launch  attacks  that  can 
easily exhaust their resources. Observe that this situation 
can  also  arise  in  networks  (either  centralized  or  distrib­
uted)  with  actuators  (e.g.  electric  motors,  industrial 
machinery), as the behavior of actuators can change when 
receiving  orders  from  remote  administrators.  Note  also 
that  it  is  possible  to  implement  additional  protection 
mechanisms  to  control  these  incoming  connections,  such 
as ﬁrewalls and additional middleware layers. 

Finally, we also have to consider the user involvement in 
the conﬁguration of the security mechanisms. User-centric 
networks, such as personal area networks [18], are one of 
the  elements  of  the  Internet  of  Things.  By  pushing  the 
intelligence  onto  the  edge  of  the  network,  it  is  possible 
for  the  owners  of  these  networks  to  create  and  manage 
their  own  policies  (cf.  Section  3.3.4).  However,  as  most 
users are not experts, mistakes will happen if the security 
mechanisms  are  not  usable  enough.  Such  misconﬁgura­
tions  can  be  exploited  by  malicious  adversaries  to  access 
personal data or even take control of that particular user-
centric network. Note that in centralized entities the con­
ﬁguration of the security mechanisms will be made by ex­
perts,  but  any  misconﬁguration  will  create  a  very 
rewarding  window  of  opportunity  that  can  be  exploited 
by any knowledgeable adversary. 

By  reviewing  these  attacker  models,  we  can  conclude 
that no approach is better in terms of threats and attacker 
models – all  of  them have  various advantages and disad­
vantages.  In  a  centralized  IoT  the  central  entity  becomes 
a single point of failure; and although the number of attack 
vectors are smaller (and the protection mechanisms might 
be better), a single vulnerability or a misconﬁguration can 
cause  extreme  damage  to  the  whole  network.  If  the  re­
sources of the network are distributed, the impact caused 
by a successful attack will be smaller, but the number of at­
tack vectors will increase. Note that in all approaches there 
will  be  a  huge  number  of  data  providers, the  things,  that 
can  be  highly  constrained  and  physically  accessible  –  in 
other  words,  easy  targets.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  any 
IoT application will have to deal with a certain amount of 
bogus data. 

3.3. Speciﬁc challenges and promising solutions 

Once the analysis of the threats and attacker models is 
ﬁnished, we can study what are the main challenges in the 
design and deployment of the security mechanisms. Such 
study,  which  will  be  performed  in  the  next  sections,  will 
help  to  point  out  speciﬁc  problems  that  must  be  consid­
ered if we want to bring the distributed IoT architectures 
to the real world. Moreover, within this study, we will ex­
plore not only existing IoT security mechanisms,  but also 
promising approaches that could be used to provide secu­
rity in a distributed IoT environment. 

3.3.1. Identity and authentication 

It  is  essential  to  consider  how  to  manage  identity and 
authentication in the Internet of Things, as multiple enti­
ties (e.g. data sources, service providers, information pro­
cessing systems) need to authenticate each other in order 
to create trustable services [25]. When deﬁning these secu­
rity  mechanisms,  we  also  have  to  consider  some  of  the 
inherent features of the Internet of Things. As interactions 
can  be  quite  dynamic,  the  entities  of  the  network  might 
not even know in advance which partners can be used to 
create  a  certain  service.  Vehicular  networks  (VANETs 
[26]) are an example of this: cars are expected to provide 
data  not  only  to  devices  located  on  the  roadside  but  also 
to other cars. Besides, if billions of things are going to be

interconnected, it is necessary to manage their identities in 
a scalable way. 

In a centralized IoT architecture, some of these challenges 
are inherently more simple. In this particular approach, the 
application  logic  is  mainly  located  in  one  central  entity 
(e.g. a cloud-based IoT application platform) that provides 
a  limited  set  of  well-known entry  points  (e.g.  APIs).  Both 
data providers, such as sensors, and information consum­
ers, such as user applications and other customers, connect 
to this central entity. As a consequence, all the authentica­
tion logic can be centralized in this entity or in an identity 
provider associated with it. In case there are data providers 
that have their own identity provider, there are no scalabil­
ity  problems,  as  such  identity  providers  can  establish  a 
relationship of trust with the central entity (a N-to-1 sce­
nario). Note that if an IoT complies with the collaboration 
principle (Collaborative IoT), it might be possible to make 
use  of  a  federated  identity  management  system,  where 
all the service providers belong to the same circle of trust. 
This simpliﬁcation cannot be found in purely distributed 
IoT  architectures,  which  fulﬁll  both  the  collaboration  and 
edge intelligence principles. In  this context  we ﬁnd  a dy­
namic N-to-N scenario, where data providers are no longer 
passive  and  are  able  to  acquire  and  process  information 
from other sources. Moreover, due to the edge intelligence 
principle, local users can query local information providers 
directly, without intervention from external entities. As a 
result, some kind of authentication logic must be present 
in every service provider – including the tiniest of objects. 
Note, however, that things do not exist in a vacuum: they 
usually belong to a speciﬁc group, are located in a particu­
lar  context,  and  are  owned  by  certain  entities.  These  as­
pects must be taken into account. 

3.3.1.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  aforementioned,  it  is 
essential to  manage  the  identities  of  the  things in  a  scal­
able  way.  However,  as  of  2012,  there  are  various  mecha­
nisms  that  can  be  used  to  identify  things  uniquely,  such 
as  the  tag  code  standards  EPC  and  ucode  [27].  Therefore, 
it is expected that in the future various systems will coex­
ist – not only at the universal level but also at a local scale 
[28].  Note,  however,  that  in  many  scenarios  the  ‘who’  is 
less important than the ‘where’ and the ‘what’. As a conse­
quence, things should be able to identify themselves using 
their  attributes  and  their  context  (e.g.  radiation  sensor 
#2044A can simply state that is a radiation sensor located 
in Shibuya, Tokyo). 

Regarding  things  authentication,  we  have  to  consider 
that  in  many  scenarios  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(e.g. intranets of things, personal area networks) located in 
the same spatial area (e.g. IoT-enabled hospitals). In such 
environments, local identity providers can manage the iden­
tities of those things, and also can create a circle of trust with 
relevant external resource providers (e.g. the household of a 
chronic patient, other hospitals). Consequently, local enti­
ties are not only able to authenticate to each other within 
the  group,  but  also  can  provide  a  proof  of  identity  when 
interacting  with  external  entities.  Also,  external  entities 
can  receive  a  temporary  persona  (e.g.  long-term  patient) 
from  the  local  identity  provider  if  necessary.  This  group-
based strategy has been, in fact, partially considered in the 

interactions between WSN islands, where interdomain col­
laboration is possible through federated identity manage­
ment and  access  tokens translation [29].  Traditional Web 
2.0 SSO such as OpenID and Shibboleth could also be used 
in this situation, although it should be noted that they were 
not designed to fulﬁll certain IoT requirements such as iden­
tity disclosure (i.e. support for privacy) [30], thus more anal­
yses are needed. 

If the thing is actually a human being, it can also be pos­
sible to use existing authentication mechanisms (e.g. web 
credentials,  electronic  identity  cards)  if  the  resource  pro­
vider  understands  them.  For  example,  Guinard  et  al.  [31] 
proposed  a  smart  gateway  infrastructure  (Social  Access 
Controller, or SAC) that allows users to retrieve data from 
local sensors using their social network (e.g. Facebook) cre­
dentials.  Note  that  this  approach  might  not  work  in  case 
the  human  being  does  not  directly  interact  with  the  IoT 
entities. In such cases, it is necessary to develop surrogate 
mechanisms  that  can  act  on  behalf  of  the  human  users. 
One existing example is the concept of the Minimal Entity 
(ME) [32] – a device that stores the digital identity of the 
user  and  acts  as  his  representative  in  the  virtual  world. 
Not only it does provide end-to-end secure communication 
and  collaboration  with  anonymous  receivers,  but  also  al­
lows  the  implementation  of  pseudonyms.  Another  exam­
ple  is  the  concept  of  a  digital  shadow  [33],  where  users 
can  delegate  their  credentials  (including  access  control 
credentials) to multiple objects or virtual entities. 

3.3.2. Access control 

In the Internet of Things, the challenges related to Access 
Control are closely related to those found in any distributed 
system. A particular service is constructed by aggregating 
several services and data sources from different locations 
and  contexts  (e.g.  a  hospital  retrieving  information  from 
home patients and ambulances). All these information pro­
viders will have their own access control policies and per­
missions  whose 
(creation,  enforcement, 
maintenance, translation) needs to be managed. 

life  cycle 

There are also some speciﬁc issues that must be taken 
into account in the context of the IoT. Granularity (i.e. pro­
viding more information to people with the right creden­
tials)  and  location  (i.e.  checking  whether  users  are 
accessing  the  services  of  a  thing  locally  or  remotely)  be­
come important elements of the access control policies in 
certain  scenarios.  For  example,  in  case  of  an  accident, 
everyone at the crash site can access my blood group, but 
only certiﬁed doctors and nurses can access my vital signs. 
Also,  whenever  access  control  mechanisms  are  imple­
mented  at  the  thing  level,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the 
amount  of  computational  resources  that  are  available,  as 
constrained  devices  might  not  have  enough  space  to 
implement  a  complex  access  control  mechanism.  Finally, 
as  many  things  are  owned  by  their  users  (either  perma­
nently or temporarily) and may belong to a group (e.g. per­
sonal area network), it is necessary to consider the design 
of delegation mechanisms, as these things may act in the 
name of the user/group. 

As with authentication, access control policies are eas­
ier to manage in centralized IoT architectures: all access con­
trol policies are stored and managed within a single central

entity. Therefore, data providers do not need to implement 
any kind of access control logic: they will send all their data 
to those whom they trust (i.e. the central entity). As a side 
effect of this conﬁguration, both data providers and infor­
mation consumers must completely trust the central entity, 
as  it  will  store  the  information  generated  by  all  network 
entities. On the other hand, purely distributed IoT architec­
tures have to deal with all previously mentioned challenges: 
management of heterogeneous policies, multiple enforce­
ment points, etc. Nevertheless, as will be mentioned in Sec­
tion 3.3.4, the overall privacy of the network improves once 
the things can control directly who accesses their own data. 
Observe  that  additional  mechanisms  must  be  imple­
mented  whenever  the  collaboration  principle  is  applied 
to centralized IoT architectures (e.g. tools for maintaining 
consistency between access control lists, resource delega­
tion  mechanisms).  Note  also  that  we  need  to  manually 
conﬁgure  the  direct  links  between  the  intranets  and  the 
external  entities  in  networks  that  only  comply  with  the 
edge intelligence principle. 

3.3.2.1. Promising approaches.  There have been very few ad­
vances  in  the  management  of  access  control  policies  for 
distributed IoTs. In fact, it is not trivial to apply existing ac­
cess control approaches to completely distributed environ­
ments.  For  example,  there  are  scalability  and  consistency 
issues  when  storing  the  list  of  users  and  their  associated 
access rights in access control lists (ACLs). Role-based ac­
cess control (RBAC) mechanisms need to deﬁne the differ­
ent roles that users can take, which might be different in 
various contexts even if they refer to the same type of en­
tity  (e.g. custodian vs. janitor).  Finally, RBAC policies that 
use attribute certiﬁcates [34] need of an infrastructure that 
allows validating such certiﬁcates in a cross-domain envi­
ronment. Note, however, that due to the speciﬁc features of 
the Internet of Things, it is possible to consider certain fac­
tors  such  as  context  as  part  of  the  access  control  model 
[35].  As a consequence, with adequate technological  sup­
port, certain policies (e.g. only authenticated users located 
within  my  vicinity  during  working  hours  can  access  to­
day’s reports) can be easily implemented. 

Besides,  there  are  various  simple  strategies  that  could 
be  used  whenever  the  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(cf.  Section  3.3.1).  For  example,  the  access  control  logic 
could  be  pushed  to  speciﬁc  trusted  entities,  which  will 
act as token-granting services à la Kerberos (i.e. a thing will 
grant access to anyone that has a valid signature created by 
a  trusted  entity).  In  another  approach,  the  access  control 
logic  can  be  implemented  within  the  things  themselves, 
but relying only on locally-deﬁned roles (e.g. a doctor from 
another  hospital  must  retrieve  his  locally-issued  role  be­
fore  interacting  with  the  local  things).  A  drawback  of  all 
these strategies is that users must ﬁrst access the trusted 
entity before requesting information from the things. 

3.3.3. Protocol and network security 

A  secure  communications  channel  is,  in  most  cases,  a 
byproduct  of  a  successful  authentication  (e.g.  server 
authentication  or  mutual  authentication  using  protocols 
such  as  TLS/DTLS).  This  process  will  make  use  of  certain 
user credentials, such as shared keys or X.509 certiﬁcates. 

If there is a limited set of well-known centralized applica­
tion  providers  (i.e.  central  entities),  the  distribution  and 
management  of  these  credentials  becomes  easier,  as  it  is 
possible  to  preload  information  in  the  devices.  However, 
in  distributed  IoT  architectures,  extra  challenges  arise:  any 
entity can connect with any other entity at any time, these 
entities  might  not  know  each  other  in  advance,  and  also 
limited devices can exchange information with other lim­
ited  devices.  Therefore,  in  this  scenario  key  management 
becomes a signiﬁcant problem. 

There are some additional challenges related to the com­
putational resources available to things. When opening a se­
cure channel, devices should be able to negotiate the actual 
parameters of that channel, such as algorithms (e.g. RSA vs. 
ECC), strength (AES-128 vs. AES-256), and protection mech­
anisms (only integrity vs. conﬁdentiality and integrity). The 
ﬁrst  reason  is  obvious:  constrained  devices  might  not  be 
able to implement certain conﬁgurations. There is another 
reason, though: adaptability. Depending on various factors 
such as the level of criticality of the data, it might not be nec­
essary to apply strong protection mechanisms to a particu­
lar  information  ﬂow  (e.g.  conﬁdentiality  and  the  on/off 
status of a street light). Another challenge is the need to ana­
lyze  the  number  of  security  protocols  that  can  be  imple­
mented within a constrained device. In fact, it is necessary 
to  carefully  study  whether  existing  Internet  protocols 
should be adapted to this context or not. Finally, things that 
can  be  accessed  directly  (e.g.  in  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach)  need  to  be  careful about  the  overhead caused by 
incoming connections (e.g. multiple incoming connections 
that require the use of public key cryptography). 

3.3.3.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  the  Internet  of  Things 
inhabits the Internet ecosystem, it is important to provide 
support for existing security protocols. In fact, the security 
of IoT-designed web transfer protocols, such as CoAP (Con­
strained Application Protocol), is largely dependant on the 
implementation of these security protocols [36]. Some pro­
tocols can be implemented without any major changes. For 
example, there are commercial implementations available 
of DTLS for constrained devices [37]. However, other proto­
cols need to be adapted due to the complexity of their de­
sign.  Such  protocols  must  achieve  a  tradeoff  between 
simplicity  and  compatibility.  For  example,  one  approach 
seeks  to  apply  IPsec  to  constrained  environments by  bal­
ancing  link-layer  security  and  IPsec  security  (cf.  Raza 
et al. [38]). 

As for the distribution of the credentials, there are var­
ious strategies that could be used to tackle this problem. As 
aforementioned  (cf.  Sections  3.3.1  and  3.3.2),  whenever 
things  belong  to  a  particular  local  group,  it  is  possible  to 
have one or various entities in charge of managing and dis­
tributing  the  credentials.  Also,  in  scenarios  where  clients 
and servers know each other in advance, it is also possible 
to  use  certain  symmetric  key-based  protocols,  which  can 
provide good properties such as high resilience to attacks 
[39].  Finally,  beyond  the  optimization  of  these  security 
protocols, there are various researchers that  are pursuing 
the  implementation  of  fast  and  compact  cryptographic 
algorithms.  There  are  various  research  areas,  which  are 
not  mutually  exclusive:  from  the  design  of  novel  hash

functions and symmetric algorithms [40] to the optimiza­
tion of existing primitives [41]. 

3.3.4. Privacy 

Up to this point we have seen that a distributed IoT archi­
tecture requires more complex security mechanisms. There 
is, however, one area where distributed IoTs provide immedi­
ate beneﬁts: Data management and privacy. The core idea is 
that, due to the edge intelligence principle, every entity has 
more control over the data it generates and processes. There 
are several consequences of this approach. Firstly, entities 
can  control  the  granularity  of  the  data  they  produce.  For 
example, a portable radiation sensor can announce that it 
is located in a certain area without providing its exact coor­
dinates. Secondly, entities can deﬁne their own access poli­
cies. The previously mentioned object can provide the city 
where it is located (Tokyo) to anonymous entities, the area 
where it is deployed (Shibuya, Tokyo) to entities with ade­
quate permissions, or even detailed GPS location informa­
tion  to  local  entities  in  case  of  emergencies.  Thirdly, 
entities do not need to provide all the data they produce, 
only the data that is needed by the external entities for a par­
ticular service. This is closely related to privacy, as it will be 
more difﬁcult to create a proﬁle of a certain entity if not all 
information is available. 

As for centralized IoT architectures (including those who 
comply  with  the  collaboration  principle),  a  data  provider 
can  also  decide  whether  to  share  or  not  a  particular data 
stream. Still, as the intelligence is located on the central en­
tity, the type of services it provides will be limited to the 
amount of data it receives. Another approach can be used 
if the centralized architecture complies with the edge intel­
ligence  principle:  as  data  providers  and  information  con­
sumers  are  able  to  communicate  directly,  they  might 
negotiate a set of secret keys in order to protect their infor­
mation. However, in this case the central entity cannot pro­
cess  the  data,  thus  it  becomes  a  simple  storage  system 
unless it implements advanced cryptographic mechanisms 
that can manipulate encrypted data, such as homomorphic 
encryption. 

As a ﬁnal note, we have to point out that the previous 
paragraphs  focus  mainly  on  the  protection  of  personal 
information, but there is another dimension of privacy that 
is  especially  relevant  in  the  context  of  the  IoT:  the  exis­
tence of entities that proﬁle and track users without their 
consent. Here, the beneﬁts of a distributed IoT might turn 
into  nightmares  when  misused.  By  following  the  edge 
intelligence  principle,  entities  can  adapt  their  behavior 
and track users more effectively. Moreover, thanks to the 
collaboration principle, these entities can share up-to-date 
information about the target. 

3.3.4.1. Promising approaches.  The distributed IoT approach 
facilitates  the  implementation  of  the  privacy-by-design 
principles  [24],  as  all  entities  can  directly  manage  their 
own data. However, it is necessary to go beyond the imple­
mentation of user-centric access policies and mechanisms 
to control the granularity of the provided data. Whenever 
human beings are involved, aspects such as the usability of 
the user interface (e.g. what can be accessed and to what ex­
tent [42]) should be taken into account. As data will be dis­

tributed  amongst  various  entities,  it  also  is  necessary  to 
study  the  applicability  of  existing  privacy-preserving  dis­
tributed data mining algorithms [43]. For example, certain 
privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) [44] such as multi­
party computations [45] can be used to provide protection 
to some cooperative protocols (e.g. cooperative benchmark­
ing and forecasting). For especially sensitive data, advanced 
concepts such as active bundles (i.e. a container with a pay­
load of sensitive data, metadata, and a virtual machine (VM) 
[46])  might be  used. Finally, the legal  privacy regulations 
should be revised to fully consider the intricacies of an al­
ways connected Internet of Things [47]. 

Regarding  the  problem  of  user  tracking  and  proﬁling, 
there are some ongoing efforts in the research community 
that aim to provide solutions for this particular threat. For 
example, there is an interesting perspective that considers 
a local environment as an operative system [48]. In short, 
incoming and outgoing items need to be scanned for rogue 
devices and malicious software that can threaten the pri­
vacy  of  the  user.  This  can  be  achieved  by  using  mecha­
nisms  such  as  the  privacy  coach  [49].  However,  as  users 
could  be  tracked  anywhere  and  anytime,  these  concepts 
should be extended in order to help users to become more 
aware  of  how  their  surroundings  capture  and  use  their 
information.  Frameworks  like  uTRUSTit  (cf.  Section  3.3.5) 
might help in this area. Besides, existing studies on surveil­
lance systems such as CCTVs [50] might also provide a clue 
on  the  speciﬁc  legal  challenges  that  our  society  will  face 
once the Internet of Things becomes a reality. 

3.3.5. Trust and governance 

There  are  other  areas  where  both  centralized  and  dis­
tributed  IoT  approaches  have  their  own  speciﬁc  advanta­
ges  and  disadvantages.  One  of  those  areas  is  Trust 
Management.  As  aforementioned,  in  the  IoT  we  can  con­
sider two dimensions of trust: trust in the interactions be­
tween  entities,  and  trust  in  the  system  from  the  users’ 
perspective.  In  a  centralized  IoT,  uncertainty  comes  from 
the  interactions  with  the  data  providers  (‘Which  data  is 
more reliable  and  fresh?’). The  holistic  point of  view  of  a 
central  entity  can  help  in  calculating  the  reputation  of 
other entities (e.g. a radiation sensor cannot give a warning 
if all sensors in the vicinity provide a low value). However, 
if  different  central  entities  collaborate  with  each  other, 
they must be able to exchange trust information in order 
to ﬁx inconsistencies in the reputation values. In a distrib­
uted IoT, there is uncertainty in both the interactions with 
the  data  providers  and  the  interactions  with  the  service 
providers (‘Who can give me a robust and timely service?’). 
The  distributed  infrastructure  makes  the  management  of 
trust more complicated: how can reputation and trust be 
calculated and shared? Which ontology should I use? Can 
I  trust  the  reports  from  other  systems?  Still,  these  trust 
management systems can make better use of second-hand 
information sources: when a certain entity is given a low 
reputation, this reputation can be propagated to other enti­
ties that might interact with such an outlier in the future. 
As for the trust in the system, it is largely dependant on 
knowing  the  internal  state  of  the  Internet  of  Things  that 
surround  us.  In  a  centralized  IoT  not  all  information  will 
be available: in order to provide services, a central entity

is more interested in retrieving physical and entity data in­
stead of status and network data. Still, if a centralized sys­
tem provides an additional ‘internal status’ service, it can 
be  able  to  supply  this  kind  of  information  very  quickly, 
as  (a)  it  stores  internally  most  of  the  information  from 
the data providers and (b) if fresh data is not available, it 
can send immediate queries to the speciﬁc data providers. 
As for a distributed IoT, this kind of service is more complex 
and  needs  more  time  to  be  completed,  as  relevant  data 
providers  must  be  discovered  and  queried.  Nevertheless, 
the more intelligence at the edge of the network, the more 
relevant information (e.g. network status, existing connec­
tions between entities) that can be retrieved. This way, it 
can be possible to have a more accurate picture of the sta­
tus of the whole system. 

Regarding  the  issues  associated  with  Governance,  it  is 
not clear how this problem will be solved in the context of 
the IoT [51], although the distributed IoT approach can pro­
vide some solutions. As policies in a distributed IoT can be 
deﬁned at the edge of the network, it could be possible to 
implement  and  enforce  certain  rules  such  as  limiting  the 
countries that can access to our data. This is not possible 
in a centralized system, whose data servers will be located 
in most cases in foreign countries. Still, as with many other 
security mechanisms, a distributed IoT needs to implement 
various  distributed  mechanisms  to  control  and  enforce 
these policies, which is not trivial. This same problem affects 
the management of accountability in the IoT. As logging sub­
systems will be distributed throughout the network, it will 
be more difﬁcult to retrieve all the relevant information that 
might be needed for forensic analysis. There is one clear ben­
eﬁt, though: if a balance between accountability and privacy 
is achieved, it will be possible to pinpoint the source of a par­
ticular problem thanks to the detailed information about the 
behavior of the system. 

3.3.5.1.  Promising  approaches.  There  are  some  theoretical 
studies  that  analyze  the  suitability  of  trust  management 
systems for the IoT. For example, Køien [52] points out that 
subjective logic systems such as TNA-SL [53] can capture dy­
namic  environments  where  beliefs  and  uncertainties 
change over time. There are other open issues that the state 
of the art needs to address, such as the management of trust 
without central authorities. Still, it might be possible to de­
velop preliminary solutions for such problems by analyzing 
how they are solved in the building blocks of the Internet of 
Things (e.g. sensor networks, ad hoc networks). The reason 
is  simple:  these  building  blocks  have  several  features  in 
common  with  the  distributed  IoT  approach.  For  example, 
ad hoc networks are dynamic environments where the net­
work is created, operated and managed by the nodes them­
selves. In such networks, the decentralization of trust, which 
is essential in a distributed IoT context, has been extensively 
studied [54]. Moreover, there are other holistic paradigms 
closely related  to  the  Internet  of  Things, such  as  ambient 
intelligence  and  pervasive  computing,  whose  existing 
works in the area might also provide additional information 
on how to deal with multidisciplinary challenges [55]. 

All the previous approaches do not consider the interac­
tions between human beings and IoT entities. In fact, as the 
Internet  of  Things  can  (and  will)  contain  user-generated 

content, we also have to ask ourselves how to model this 
type  of  trust.  One  promising  approach  is  the  existence  of 
user-managed  circles  of  trust,  as  described  in  the  shop­
pingLense system by Robinson et al. [56]. This system in­
creases  users’  trust  in  the  IoT  by  including  trusted 
metadata  in  the  information  ﬂow.  In  particular,  patterns 
(e.g. QR  codes) located in the environment (e.g.  shopping 
mall)  are  digitally  signed  and  owned  by  a  user-deﬁned 
group. Members of that group can also add ratings to a par­
ticular pattern. This way, if a user trusts a particular group, 
it  can  acquire  both  information  from  the  pattern  and 
trusted  ratings  from  other  users.  Finally,  regarding  the 
trust in the system from the users’ perspective, one partic­
ular research project (uTRUSTit [57]) has already produced 
promising results in this area. In particular, the framework 
developed in this project not only provides an inventory of 
the  local  devices  that  are  connected  to  the  Internet  of 
Things, but also enables users to know their status, allow­
ing the creation of a mental model of the virtual world. 

3.3.6. Fault tolerance 

Regardless  of  the  approach,  centralized  or  distributed, 
there  is  an  expected  population  of  billions  of  things  that 
will  act  as  data  and  information  providers.  Such  things 
can  become  faulty  and  stop  working,  but  they  also  can 
send  bogus  or  even  manipulated  data.  As  mentioned  in 
Section 3.2, it is unrealistic to assume that a data process­
ing  entity  will  never  have  to  deal  with  such  problematic 
data. Therefore, in the IoT context, it is essential to consider 
fault tolerance. We must not only aim to provide a ‘best-ef­
fort’ service in case parts of the network are not accessible, 
but also assume that every entity can receive bogus infor­
mation from other entities. 

In case one of the things fails and stops sending data, it 
is  necessary  to  discover  another  thing  that  can  provide  a 
similar set of data. In centralized IoT architectures this task 
is  more  simple,  as  the  central  entity  will  have  access  to 
all data ﬂows. As for distributed IoT architectures, they need 
to develop a discovery mechanism that is able to pinpoint 
related data ﬂows. Note that additional mechanisms need 
to  be  implemented  in  order  to  assure  the  survivability of 
the  network  in  case  of  a  failure  of  part  of  the  infrastruc­
ture: not only data providers need to be located, but also 
service providers and data processing entities as well. 

As for the existence of bogus data, it is possible to devel­
op holistic (centralized) and detailed (distributed) mecha­
nisms that deal with this problem. A centralized system can 
analyze the consistency of the data, pinpointing data pro­
viders who seem to behave erratically. A distributed system 
can  make  use  of  the  additional  information  (e.g.  network 
information) retrieved at a local level or in the interactions 
with other  entities to  apply  advanced intrusion detection 
systems.  Both  approaches  have  their  own  challenges,  but 
they are not mutually exclusive (e.g. in a distributed envi­
ronment there can be certain entities that provide high-le­
vel 
IoT 
infrastructures), thus it is advisable to take full advantage 
of both of them if possible.

to  provide  service  survivability  in  the  IoT.  Still,  there  are 
various research approaches that can be used as a founda­
tion to enable such fault tolerance. For example, the tools 
that allow human users to create a mental model of their 
surroundings  (highlighted  in  Section  3.3.5)  can  also  be 
used  by  the  network  entities  to  discover  devices  that  are 
faulty. There are also various theoretical platforms whose 
aim is to provide service look-up, discovery and composi­
tion mechanisms for the Internet of Things [58]. However, 
it is necessary to study their applicability in an heteroge­
neous  distributed  environment.  The  use  of  local  clusters 
can  help  with  this  task:  if  entities  are  clustered  in  local 
groups, that cluster can incorporate mechanisms that not 
only  provide  up-to-date  information  about  local  things, 
but also enable the interaction of different service discov­
ery  protocols  through  specialized  middleware  [58].  Be­
sides, all these services can make use of the functionality 
provided  by  existing  security  mechanisms  such  as  trust 
management  (e.g.  only  reports  from  trusted  entities  will 
be  considered,  zones  with  high  reputation  will  take  care 
of the extra workload). 

Regarding  the  detection  of  bogus  data  and  malicious 
entities,  most  existing  intrusion  detection  mechanisms 
and  rules  focus  on  internal  adversaries  that  try  to  attack 
the speciﬁc protocols of data acquisition networks (e.g. sen­
sor networks) [59], but do not consider attacks that target 
the interactions between different IoT domains (e.g. a DoS 
attack or a malformed packet attack targeting a smart door 
service [60]). In fact, the state of the art on this speciﬁc area 
is very limited and only few works are available [61,62]. It is 
then  necessary  to  implement  new  detection  mechanisms 
that take into account the distributed IoT speciﬁc attacker 
models. Note that it is also possible, in certain scenarios, to 
adapt existing mechanisms. For example, centralized enti­
ties  can  make  use  of  clustering-based  mechanisms  and 
other data mining techniques to detect outliers and intru­
sions [63]. Moreover, lessons might be taken from existing 
distributed  intrusion  detection  systems  implemented  in 
similar environments such as smart grids [64]. 

3.4. Summary 

A summary of the challenges studied in the previous sec­
tions is shown in Table 2. We can conclude that the decen­
tralized  and  heterogeneous  nature  of  the  distributed 
approach increases the complexity of most security mecha­
nisms  (Identity  and  Authentication,  Access  Control,  Protocol 
and  Network  Security,  Trust  management  and  Fault  Toler­
ance).  Still,  there  are  some  security  mechanisms  (Privacy, 
Trust  management  and  Governance,  Fault  Tolerance)  where 

i)  the  distributed  approach  provides  interesting  features, 
ii) both approaches (centralized and distributed) can com­
plement each other. 

In the previous sections we have also highlighted various 
strategies that could be used in the near future to design and 
deploy IoT-speciﬁc security mechanisms. One such strategy 
assumes that things belong to a certain group (intranet of 
things, personal area network) located in a certain spatial 
area (IoT-enabled hospital, household). These groups com­
ply with the edge intelligence and collaboration principles, 
thus  they  are  part  of  the  distributed  IoT.  Once  the  things 
are grouped, the implementation of certain security mecha­
nisms becomes easier: local identity providers can be de­
ﬁned, the access control logic can be pushed onto speciﬁc 
entities, a mental model of the virtual world can be created, 
and so on. Note that this strategy might be partially applica­
ble to highly dynamic environments such as VANETs [26] if 
we consider the existence of logical groups (‘‘all cars that 
have  been  registered  in  Singapore’’),  although  more  re­
search is needed to validate this point of view. 

Other strategies focus on the interactions of human users 
with the  Internet  of Things.  For  example, as  digital social 
infrastructures  have  been  already  deployed,  they  can  be 
used in the implementation of speciﬁc security mechanisms 
such as user-deﬁned access control and circles of trust. Fi­
nally,  another  strategy  consists  of  adapting  the  security 
mechanisms  that  have  been  developed  in  i)  the  building 
blocks  of  the  Internet  of  Things  (e.g.  sensor  networks,  ad 
hoc  networks)  and  ii)  other  paradigms  closely  related  to 
the Internet of Things (ambient intelligence, pervasive com­
puting). Note that while the building blocks lack the com­
plexity of the distributed IoT approach, they share certain 
similarities such as the decentralization of resources. In fact, 
some security mechanisms, such as Key Management, have 
been successfully adapted to certain IoT scenarios [39]. 

4. Conclusions 

The main goal of this paper was to provide an explicit 
analysis of the features and security challenges of the dis­
tributed  approach  of  the  Internet  of  Things,  in  order  to 
understand what is its place in the Future Internet. There 
are numerous challenges that must be solved, such as assur­
ing interoperability, reaching a business model, and manag­
ing  the  authentication  and  authorization  of  entities.  Still, 
there are multiple beneﬁts as well. Since intelligence is not 
concentrated  on  a  limited  set  of  centralized  application 
platforms  –  although 
can  also 
exist in order to provide additional support – scalability is 
improved. Data is managed by the distributed entities, thus 

these  platforms

it is possible not only to push/pull data only when needed, 
but  also  to  implement  speciﬁc  privacy  policies.  Besides, 
additional trust and fault tolerance mechanisms can be spe­
ciﬁcally created for this approach. These and other beneﬁts 
show that this approach is actually useful and applicable to 
the real world. As a ﬁnal note, we would like to stress that 
both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  can  coexist 
with each other, providing the foundations of a full-ﬂedged 
Internet of Things.

In the Internet of Things, services can be provisioned using centralized architectures, where 
central entities acquire, process, and provide information. Alternatively, distributed archi­
tectures, where entities at the edge of the network exchange information and collaborate 
with each other in a dynamic way, can also be used. In order to understand the applicabil­
ity and viability of this distributed approach, it is necessary to know its advantages and dis­
advantages  –  not  only  in  terms  of  features  but  also  in  terms  of  security  and  privacy 
challenges. The purpose of this paper is to show that the distributed approach has various 
challenges that need to be solved, but also various interesting properties and strengths.

1. Introduction 

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved 
over time [1–3]. Nevertheless, its core idea can be summa­
rized in a sentence: ‘A worldwide network of interconnected 
entities’.  In  most  cases,  these  heterogeneous  entities, 
‘things’ (e.g. Human beings and computers, books and cars, 
appliances  and  food)  have  a  locatable,  addressable,  and 
readable counterpart on the Internet. They can open a com­
munication  channel  with  any  other  entity,  providing  and 
receiving services at any time, any place, and in any way. 
Many technologies serve as the building blocks of this new 
paradigm, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), RFID, 
cloud services, machine-to-machine interfaces (M2M), and 
so on. Also, this paradigm has a multitude of application do­
mains,  such  as  automotive,  healthcare,  logistics,  environ­
mental monitoring, and many others. 

There is no single strategy for realizing the vision of the 
IoT,  as  services  can  be  provisioned  in  various  ways.  In  a 
centralized approach, application platforms located in the 
Internet  (e.g.  cloud  services)  acquire  information  from

entities located in data acquisition networks, and provide 
raw  data and  services to  other entities.  These application 
platforms  control  the  whole  information  ﬂow,  and  there 
is little or no support for accessing the information provid­
ers directly. In fact, there are multiple industrial solutions 
that  make  use  of  this  approach  [4,5].  On  the  other  hand, 
in  a  distributed  approach,  not  only  the  intelligence  and 
the  provisioning  of  services  is  located  at  the  edge  of  the 
network, but also various application platforms can collab­
orate with each other dynamically. 

In the context of the IoT, the importance of the distrib­
uted  approach  as  an  element  of  the  Future  Internet  of 
Things  has  been  previously  mentioned  in  the  literature 
(cf. [1]). However, there have been no explicit analyses of 
its features and its challenges. In order to understand the 
viability  and  applicability  of  this  distributed  approach,  it 
is necessary to explicitly know its actual features and ma­
jor  principles,  including  the  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages. 
Also, as security and privacy are important factors that will 
inﬂuence the adoption of the IoT paradigm, it is essential to 
know what are the security and privacy challenges – and 
beneﬁts  –  of  the  distributed  approach,  and  what  are  the 
most promising approaches  in this ﬁeld. If the challenges 
are too complex and the beneﬁts too small, it might make 
sense to focus mainly on the centralized approach for IoT

deployments. The purpose of this paper is to assess and an­
swer these questions. 

The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 will 
focus on the analysis of the centralized and distributed ap­
proaches. In this section we will summarize the state of the 
art, introduce a taxonomy of the different approaches, and 
provide  an  analysis  of  the  features  of  these  approaches. 
Section 3 will focus on the analysis of the different security 
challenges. In this section we will overview the existing IoT 
security challenges (3.1), introduce an attacker model that 
can  be  applied  to  both  centralized  and  distributed  IoT 
architectures  (3.2),  and  study  the  main  challenges  and 
promising  solutions  in  the  design  and  deployment  of  the 
security  mechanisms  (3.3).  Finally,  conclusions  are  pre­
sented in Section 4. 

2. A distributed internet of things 

2.1. Related work: Government, Academia and Industry 

The concept of a distributed IoT is not novel. In fact, var­
ious  ofﬁcial  documents  consider  it  as  one  of  the  possible 
strategies that can push the dream of the IoT into the real 
world, and it has been explicitly mentioned that the devel­
opment of decentralized autonomic architectures and the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  very  edge  of  the  networks 
are  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  [2].  Still,  some  key 
questions  have  to  be  answered  to  make  the  most  of  this 
strategy  in  the  real  world,  such  as  the  speciﬁc  situations 
on  which  the  network  intelligence  should  be  distributed 
[1].  In  order  to  answer  these  questions,  it  is  necessary  to 
study the speciﬁc requirements of applications. For exam­
ple, whether an  application  needs support for distributed 
ownership of data [3]. This and other issues that have been 
raised  by  these  governmental  studies  are  being  carefully 
considered by the research community. 

There are various research articles that study different 
instances of distributed IoT architectures. For example, Go­
mez-Goiri and López-de-Ipiña [6] combine the concept of 
the web of things (using web protocols to implement the 
IoT)  with  the  concept  of  triple  spaces  (using  semantic 
web techniques to exchange knowledge in a distributed lo­
cal  shared  space)  to  create  a  distributed  environment 
where devices located in two or more spaces can collabo­
rate with each other through Internet services. In another 
example, which follows a more holistic point of view, Ning 
and  Liu  [7]  describe  a  heterogeneous  system  known  as 
U2IoT  that  comprises  two  subsystems:  Unit  IoTs,  which 
are basic local cells that provide solutions for special appli­
cations, and Ubiquitous IoT, which comprises the different 
Unit IoTs plus other managers and controls the collabora­
tion between all entities. 

There  are also  many research  projects  funded by vari­
ous  government  bodies  that,  directly  or  indirectly,  are 
studying as of 2012 the needs of a distributed IoT architec­
ture. Precisely, one of these projects, IoT-A [8], is aiming to 
provide an architectural reference model for the interoper­
ability of Internet of Things systems. Note that such a ref­
erence  architecture  does  not  mandate  how  all  entities 
should  collaborate,  or  who  should  analyze  the  data  and 

provide  the  different  services.  Still,  the  communication 
model provides the foundations for the creation of distrib­
uted applications, allowing digital entities to directly con­
nect and interact with other digital entities. Moreover, the 
location  of  intelligence  at  the  edge  of  the  network  is 
implicitly considered, as digital entities range from simple 
devices to abstract entities made up of various distributed 
devices. Therefore, its building blocks [9] could be used in 
the future to create fully distributed IoT applications. 

Some concrete building blocks, which can help to build 
a distributed IoT, have been indirectly studied in other re­
search  projects.  For  example,  the  HYDRA  project  [10] 
developed an open source middleware that allows legacy 
devices to provide web services over the Internet – directly 
or indirectly. HYDRA also provides some tools that can be 
used to enable collaboration, such as a device and service 
discovery  interface.  This  interface  can  make  use  of  an 
ontology  to  describe  the  available  services,  achieving 
semantic  consistency.  Another  project,  SENSEI  [11],  was 
more focused on providing a consistent interface to access 
the  services  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN)  islands. 
But  it  produced  other  relevant  results,  such  as  semanti­
cally-enabled resource directories, and local management 
systems that beneﬁt of the existence of such directories. Fi­
nally, other projects, like CUBIQ [12] and SMARTPRODUCTS 
[13], studied and developed various P2P-based distributed 
mechanisms,  such  as  a  distributed  publish/subscribe  sys­
tem and a distributed storage system. 

Beyond theoretical research, there are numerous com­
panies and start-ups that are making use of cloud technol­
ogies to provide IoT services. The key idea is that all edge 
devices and intranet of things will send their information 
periodically to an application platform located in the cloud. 
This platform stores  all the  data and provides  specialized 
API  interfaces  that  can  be  used  by  3rd  parties  to  create 
their  IoT  applications.  There  are  various  approaches  for 
implementing these types of platforms: from closed envi­
ronments  where  even  the  sensors  are  controlled  by  the 
company [4] to more open platforms that allow the inte­
gration of external devices and databases [5]. Most of these 
solutions  are  completely  centralized:  edge  systems  act 
mainly as data acquisition networks, and application plat­
forms from different vendors are not prepared to interact 
with each other. Yet there are some platforms that, pursu­
ing the idea of creating private and hybrid clouds, can be 
deployed  in  a  local  environment  [14].  These  platforms 
not only enable the existence of local intelligence but also 
can exchange information and services with external sys­
tems, thus they can easily become instances of the distrib­
uted IoT. 

2.2. A taxonomy of the vision 

In the previous section, we have seen that there are two 
principles that  have  been  applied  to  most distributed  IoT 
architectures:  (i)  the  location  of  the  intelligence  and  the 
provisioning  of  services  at  the  edge  of  the  network  (edge 
intelligence),  and  (ii)  the  collaboration  between  diverse 
entities in order to achieve a common goal (collaboration). 
In  fact,  these  two  principles  are  core  elements  in  the 
construction  of  ‘decentralized  systems’  and  ‘distributed

3 

systems’, respectively. In organizational theory, decentral­
ized  systems  delegate  the  decision-making  authority  to 
entities  located  in  the  lower  levels.  Such  delegation  can 
also  allow  the  implementation  of  any  decisions  without 
relying on the approval of high-level entities [15]. On the 
other hand, a distributed system consists of multiple enti­
ties that collaborate with each other and appear to users as 
a single coherent system [16]. 

These  two  principles,  edge  intelligence  and  collabora­
tion, can be used to deﬁne a taxonomy of possible Distrib­
uted  Internet  of  Things  approaches,  which  is  presented 
below. Two of these approaches (collaborative IoT and con­
nected  intranet  of  things)  comply  with  only  one  of  the 
principles,  while  a  ‘‘full’’  distributed  IoT  complies  with 
both  principles.  We  will  also  include  the  deﬁnition  of  a 
centralized IoT for the sake of completeness. 

(A)	  Centralized IoT.  A Centralized  Internet of  Things (cf. 
Fig. 1A) does not provide any of the previously men­
tioned principles. In this scenario, the data acquisi­
tion  networks  (i.e.  networks  of  things  such  as 
mobile  phones,  radiation  sensors  [17],  and  cars) 
are passive: their only task is to provide data. All this 
data  will  be  retrieved  by  a  single  central  entity, 
which  will  process  it  into  information,  combine  it, 
and  provide  it  to  its  customers.  Consequently,  if 
users  want  to  make  use  of  IoT  services,  they  must 
connect  through  the  Internet  to  the  interfaces  pro­
vided by this central entity. Note that there are var­
ious  strategies  to  implement  this  approach.  For 
example, the central entity can be instantiated using 
a  simple  server  or  a  cluster  of  devices  forming  a 
cloud  (or  even  located  in  the  cloud  itself,  cf.  solu­
tions  such  as  [4]).  Also,  its  interfaces  can  provide 
both raw and preprocessed data, enabling the crea­
tion of more complex 3rd party services. 

(B)	  Collaborative IoT. While in this approach the ‘intelli­
gence’ of the network is still located within the cen­
tral  entities  (data  acquisition  networks  still  behave 
as  passive  entities,  users  access  the  information 
through the central entity interfaces), the main dif­
ference with a centralized IoT is its compliance with 
the collaboration principle. As a result, there are var­
ious  central  entities  that  can  exchange  data  and/or 
information  with  each  other,  generating  new  ser­
vices  or  enriching  existing  ones  (cf.  Fig.  1B).  For 
example, IoT service providers that analyze the radi­
ation in the atmosphere of different cities can collab­
orate in order to provide a snapshot of the radiation 
levels in the whole country. 

(C)	  Connected Intranets of Things. In this approach, data 
acquisition networks (Intranets of Things) can actu­
ally process local information, and also provide it not 
only to central entities but also to local and remote 
users (cf. Fig. 1C). However, there are no underlying 
mechanisms  (e.g.  discovery  services,  ontologies) 
that  facilitate  the  collaboration  between  entities. 
As  a  result,  the  information  mainly  ﬂows  from  the 
intranets  to  a  central  entity,  which  will  be  able  to 
provide a holistic point of view of the whole system. 
For  example,  IoT-enabled  hospitals  need  to  access 
the  services  of  a  central  IoT  entity  to  obtain  global 
information (e.g. overall bed occupancy). Note, how­
ever, that if the central entities fail, the local services 
(e.g. the vital signs records of local patients) can still 
be accessed. 

(D)	  Distributed IoT. In this vision, all entities can have the 
ability  to  retrieve,  process,  combine,  and  provide 
information  and  services  to  other  entities  (cf. 
Fig.  1D).  Intranet  of  things  (ranging  from  personal 
area networks (PANs) [18]  to  smart city  infrastruc­
tures  [19])  evolve  from  isolated  entities  to  fully

interconnected systems, not only providing services 
at a local level but also collaborating with each other 
and  with  other  IoT  architectures  towards  common 
goals.  Observe  that  it  is  also  possible  to  integrate 
higher-level  cloud-based  services  or  other  central­
ized  entities  (e.g.  data  repositories)  within  this 
architecture,  but  they  are  not  required.  Following 
the  e-health  example  highlighted  above,  the  IoT  of 
a  hospital  can  interact  with  the  IoT  located  in  the 
household  of  a  patient,  or  even  with  the  PANs  of 
the personnel located inside the premises. Moreover, 
all hospitals can easily collaborate so as to obtain the 
overall bed occupancy. 

2.3. Analysis of distributed IoT features 

After presenting the taxonomy of the different distrib­
uted  IoT  approaches,  this  section  analyzes  their  features, 
pointing  out  their  beneﬁts  and  disadvantages.  This 
is specially important because, as shown in Section 2.1, cen­
tralized IoT architectures (mostly based on cloud technolo­
gies) are not only gaining momentum but also satisfying the 
requirements of users as of 2012. Therefore, it is necessary to 
review and understand the beneﬁts of all these approaches 
in order to measure their viability, even if the notion of a dis­
tributed IoT has been explicitly mentioned as one of the ele­
ments of the Future Internet infrastructure [3,2,8]. For this 
analysis, we will use various requirements and properties 
of IoT deployments that have been gathered from existing 
reports  and  research  documents.  They  are  enumerated 
below: 

•  Openness.  Beyond  presenting  raw  data  and  other  spe­
cialized  services,  an  IoT  platform  can  also  be  ﬂexible 
enough to allow 3rd parties to develop complex appli­
cations through the provision of an API. 

•  Viability. This property encompasses two concepts: busi­
ness model (whether it is viable to market this technol­
ogy) and vendor lock-in (whether a company can take 
the long-term risk of depending on a particular provider). 
•  Reliability. Not only the  IoT architecture must be resil­
ient  enough  to  assure  a  certain  level  of  availability, 
but also needs to provide a performance that is tailored 
to the speciﬁc needs of the applications. 

•  Scalability. Within this paradigm, it is expected that the 
number  of  devices  and  the  amount  of  data  generated 
and processed by those devices will grow exponentially 

(i.e. the concept of ‘‘data deluge’’). Thus, we have to take 
scalability and extensibility into account. 

•  Interoperability. Even if the Internet of Things is inher­
ently  heterogeneous,  all  its  components  must  be  able 
to  interact  with  each  other.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary 
to  achieve  service  and  semantic 
interoperability, 
amongst other things. 

•  Data Management. As the different elements of the Inter­
net of Things produce data, either by sensing or by pro­
cessing,  we  must  take  certain  design  decisions:  where 
the data should be stored? how the data is accessed? 

•  Security  Issues.  There  are  various  security  issues  that 
must  be  considered  in  order  to  achieve  a  trusted  and 
fault-tolerant IoT: how to protect the communications? 
how  to manage  authentication  and  access control in  a 
world  of  billions  of  things?  what  about  the  privacy  of 
the users, and the security of the data generated by the 
things? 

Table 1 presents an overview of the features (minus the 
Security  issues)  of  the  centralized  IoT  approach,  together 
with the features of approaches that follow the collabora­
tion  and  edge  intelligence  principles.  From  the  results  of 
this  table,  it  is  possible  to  infer  why  the  centralized  ap­
proach was the ﬁrst to enter the market. In terms of open­
ness, a centralized solution usually provides a small set of 
(mostly) proprietary APIs for acquiring and providing data. 
This way, application developers can use these APIs to de­
velop  rich  and  complex IoT  applications.  Regarding  avail­
ability,  most  companies  build 
infrastructures 
through cloud companies, which usually have a very good 
service uptime: in 2012 [20] it was 99.99% with a standard 
deviation  of  0.00215%.  As  for  interoperability,  it  is  easy  to 
achieve: all data sources will interact with the data acqui­
sition  API  provided  by  the  centralized  system,  thus  it  is 
only necessary to create one adaptor per data source. Final­
ly,  the  viability  of  the  business  model  has  been  proved  by 
the existence of proﬁtable ventures and companies. 

their 

Although the centralized approach has a great potential 
to bring the IoT into life, the other distributed approaches 
also  provide  interesting  advantages.  In  the  collaborative 
IoT approach (which follows the collaboration principle), 
the  risk  of  vendor  lock-in  becomes  smaller,  as  customers 
can combine different service providers to obtain a partic­
ular service. Availability is improved too: if one of the ser­
vice  providers  fails,  customers  can  not  only  try  to  search 
another  entity  that  manages  a  similar  data  set,  but  also

use  the  other  providers  to  retrieve  a  partial  view  of  the 
information.  In  addition,  the  scalability  feature  is  greatly 
improved  by  the  distribution  of  the  computational  and 
data management resources. Finally, it is important to note 
that the performance of this approach can be slightly worse 
due to the information exchange between the different ser­
vice providers, but the risk of bottleneck decreases. 

Regarding the advantages of the connected intranets of 
things approach (which follows the edge intelligence prin­
ciple), while the risk of vendor lock-in remains the same (i.e. 
a customer uses only one service provider for a particular 
service),  customers  can  still  directly  access  the  interfaces 
provided by the intranets. This is also beneﬁcial for the avail­
ability of the services, as customers can still retrieve raw and 
processed data from the intranets in case a problematic sit­
uation arises. There are also some minor improvements in 
scalability, since the complexity of the central entities can 
be simpliﬁed by delegating various processing tasks to the 
intranets. Note that these advantages are mostly related to 
external  customers (i.e.  users  that  access  the  information 
produced  by  various  intranets  through  a  central  entity), 
but this approach also provides speciﬁc beneﬁts to local cus­
tomers, that is, users that make use of the speciﬁc local ser­
vices  of  the  intranet.  Firstly,  users  do  not  need  to  be 
connected to the Internet in order to obtain relevant infor­
mation about its surroundings. Secondly, in case of failure 
of the central entities or the Internet connection, the local 
services are still available. Thirdly, the performance of local 
services is also improved, as services are available through 
the local communication channels. 

Both of the previous approaches also have some disad­
vantages  that  are  worth  mentioning.  Due  to  the  interac­
tions  between  various  heterogeneous  devices  and 
infrastructures (e.g. intranets providing interfaces to exter­
nal users, different service providers exchanging informa­
tion),  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  are  needed  to 
achieve  openness  and 
interoperability  (e.g.  ontologies, 
search  and  discovery,  interfaces)  are  more  complex  and 
probably need to be standardized. 

Finally,  although  the  distributed  IoT  approach  com­
bines most of the advantages and disadvantages of the pre­
vious two approaches (superior scalability, limited vendor 
lock-in, infrastructure complexity), there are some new as­
pects that need to be explicitly mentioned. For example, in 
terms of data management, the provisioning of data can fol­
low the ‘push’ model (provide only when it is needed), as it 
is not necessary to provide all data to a central system. In 
terms of availability, the service uptime is more dependant 
on  how  many  resources  are  invested  in  maintaining  the 
underlying IoT infrastructures, but a failure in one element 
of  the  infrastructure  will  not  affect  the  whole  system.  As 
for the business model, it might be less well-deﬁned in com­
parison  to  the  model  of  a  centralized  IoT,  but  there  are 
some approaches that can be taken, such as maintenance 
fees or management of open source (OSS) services. 

All  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  have  their 
own advantages and disadvantages; and in case of the dis­
tributed approaches, the challenges that need to be solved 
are more numerous (e.g. locate and manage different APIs 
from  multiple  and  heterogeneous  service  providers, 
achieve  semantic  interoperability).  Still,  the  partially  dis­

tributed approaches, which comply either with the collab­
oration  or  with  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  provide 
several  interesting  advantages  such  as  better  availability 
and  higher  scalability.  Moreover,  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach  also  allows  diverse  IoT  entities  to  cooperate  even 
if no central systems are available, amongst other beneﬁts. 
Therefore, they can be seriously considered as an enabler 
of future IoT deployments, such as remote healthcare man­
agement. Note that all approaches are not mutually exclu­
sive: central entities (e.g. data storage systems) can coexist 
with distributed IoT entities (e.g. service providers) within 
the distributed IoT ecosystem. 

There  is  one  open  question  that  must  be  answered, 
though. Security has not been studied in this section, due 
to the need of analyzing its impact on all approaches more 
thoroughly. 

3. Security issues in distributed IoT systems 

Although academic research on the topic of security in 
the Internet of Things is still in its infancy, there is a sub­
stantial body of work that analyzes the existing challenges 
and possible protection mechanisms (cf. Section 3.1). How­
ever, existing research mainly provides an overview of the 
generic problems – without considering the impact of spe­
ciﬁc features such as the ones studied in this paper. In or­
der  to  understand  the  speciﬁc  security  issues  of  a 
distributed IoT, it is necessary not only to analyze the im­
pact  of  the  distributed  IoT  principles  (collaboration,  edge 
intelligence) over the existing threats and attacker models 
(Section 3.2), but also to study the inﬂuence of these prin­
ciples  in  the  integration  of  the  different  security  mecha­
nisms (Section 3.3). 

3.1. IoT security: an overview 

One of the major challenges that must be overcome in 
order to push the Internet of Things into the real world is 
security.  IoT  architectures  are  supposed  to  deal  with  an 
estimated  population  of  billions  of  objects,  which  will 
interact  with  each  other  and  with  other  entities,  such  as 
human beings or virtual entities. And all these interactions 
must be secured somehow, protecting the information and 
service provisioning of all relevant actors and limiting the 
number of incidents that will affect the entire IoT. 

However, protecting the Internet of Things is a complex 
and difﬁcult task. The number of attack vectors available to 
malicious  attackers  might  become  staggering,  as  global 
connectivity  (‘‘access  anyone’’)  and  accessibility  (‘‘access 
anyhow,  anytime’’)  are  key  tenets  of  the  IoT.  The  threats 
that  can  affect  the  IoT  entities  are  numerous,  such  as  at­
tacks that target diverse communication channels, physical 
threats,  denial  of  service,  identity  fabrication,  and  others 
[21].  Finally,  the  inherent  complexity  of  the  IoT,  where 
multiple  heterogeneous  entities  located  in  different  con­
texts  can  exchange  information  with  each  other,  further 
complicates the design and deployment of efﬁcient, inter­
operable and scalable security mechanisms. 

Some of the previously mentioned challenges, alongside 
with  the  security  mechanisms  that  should  be  integrated

into the Internet of Things, have been already enumerated 
by the research community [3,22,23]. They are as follows: 

•  Heterogeneity  has  a  great  inﬂuence  over  the  protocol 
and  network  security  services  that  must  be  imple­
mented  in  the  IoT.  Constrained  devices  will  interact 
with  various  heterogeneous  devices  (e.g.  other  con­
strained  devices,  full-ﬂedged  web  servers)  either 
directly or through gateways. In this scenario, not only 
it is essential to implement efﬁcient cryptographic algo­
rithms that can provide a high throughput even in 8-bit 
or 16-bit devices, but also to adapt or create lightweight 
security protocols that offer an end-to-end secure com­
munication  channel.  These  protocols  require  creden­
tials,  thus  optimal  key  management  systems  must  be 
implemented to distribute these credentials and to help 
in  establishing  the  necessary  session  keys  between 
peers. 

•  The existence of billions of heterogeneous objects also 
affects  identity  management.  Beyond  deﬁning  the 
actual scope of ‘identity’ in this context (e.g. underlying 
identity  vs.  real  identity,  core  identity  vs.  temporary 
identity),  we  also  need  to  provide  some  mechanisms 
for achieving universal authentication. Without authen­
tication,  it  will  not  be  possible  to  assure  that  the  data 
ﬂow  produced  by  a  certain  entity  contains  what  it  is 
supposed to contain. Another important aspect related 
to  authentication  is  authorization.  If  there  is  no  access 
control  whatsoever,  everything  will  be  accessed  by 
everyone, which is neither viable nor realistic. 

•  In fact, the data deluge caused by billions of entities cre­
ating information is a big threat to privacy. Users must 
have tools that allow them to retain their anonymity in 
this superconnected world. Other tools must provide a 
snapshot  of  the  information  and  policies  surrounding 
a particular user, enabling transparency and preventing 
the notion that the IoT is silently controlling our lives. 
In fact, the IoT itself must seriously consider the imple­
mentation of the privacy by design principles [24], pro­
viding  user-centric  support  for  security  and  privacy 
from its very own foundations. 

•  The  size  and  heterogeneity  of  the  IoT  also  affects  its 
trust  and  governance.  There  are  actually  two  dimen­
sions of trust: (a) trust in the interaction between enti­
ties, where we have to deal with uncertainty about the 
future actions of all collaborating entities, and (b) trust 
in  the  system  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  user,  as 
users must be able to manage their things so as to not 
feel  under  some  unknown  external  control.  Regarding 
governance,  it  is  a  double-edged  sword  that  must  be 
wielded with care. On the  one hand, it offers  stability, 
support  for  political  decisions,  and  the  possibility  to 
deﬁne common frameworks and interoperability mech­
anisms.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily 
become  excessive, 
fostering  an  over-controlled 
environment. 

•  The number of vulnerable systems and attacks vectors 
will surely increase in the context of the IoT, thus fault 
tolerance  becomes  essential.  Not  only  we  must  strive 
for  security  by  default  (robust  implementations,  usable 
systems,  etc.)  in  the  IoT,  but  also  we  need  to  develop 

awareness  mechanisms  that  can  be  used  to  create  the 
foundations of intrusion detection and prevention mecha­
nisms,  which  will  help  IoT  entities  to  protect  or  even 
gracefully  degrade  their  services.  Finally,  recovery  ser­
vices  must  be  able  to  locate  unsafe  zones  (i.e.  zones 
affected  by  attacks)  and  redirect  the  functionality  of 
the systems to other trusted zones. 

3.2. Analysis of attacker models and threats 

As aforementioned, in order to understand how the dif­
ferent  approaches  presented  in  Section  2.2  should  be  se­
cured  in  the  future,  it  is  ﬁrstly  necessary  to  enumerate 
and analyze the attacker models. These models have been 
deﬁned in a way that they can be applied to both central­
ized  and  distributed  IoT  approaches.  Note,  however,  that 
the  concept  of  ‘perimeter’  in  the  Internet  of  Things  is  a 
bit  fuzzy:  an  attacker  can  control  part  of  the  network, 
but due to the inherent distributed nature of the IoT, it is 
nearly impossible for an attacker to fully control the whole 
system. As a result, an attacker can be both ‘internal’ and 
‘external’ at the same time. These attacker models, catego­
rized by threats, are introduced in the following paragraph. 

•  Denial  of  service  (DoS).  There are a wide number of DoS 
attacks that can be launched against the IoT. Beyond tradi­
tional Internet DoS attacks that exhaust service provider 
resources  and  network  bandwidth,  the  actual  wireless 
communication  infrastructure  of  most  data  acquisition 
networks can also be targeted (e.g. jamming the channels). 
Malicious internal attackers that take control of part of the 
infrastructure can create even more mayhem. 

•  Physical damage. This threat can be seen as a subset of 
the DoS threat. In this attacker model, active attackers 
usually lack  technical  knowledge, and  can  only hinder 
the provisioning of IoT services by destroying the actual 
‘things’.  This  is  a  realistic  attack  in  the  IoT  context, 
because  things  might  be  easily  accessible  to  anyone 
(e.g.  a  street  light).  If  that  is  not  possible,  the  attacker 
can simply target the hardware module in charge of cre­
ating the ‘virtual persona’ of the thing. 

•  Eavesdropping. Passive attackers can target various com­
munication channels (e.g. wireless networks, local wired 
networks,  Internet)  in  order  to  extract  data  from  the 
information  ﬂow.  Obviously,  an  internal  attacker  that 
gains  access  to  a  particular  infrastructure  will  be  able 
to  extract  the  information  that  circulates  within  that 
infrastructure. 

•  Node Capture. As aforementioned, things (e.g. household 
appliances, street lights) are physically located in a cer­
tain environment. Instead of destroying them, an active 
attacker can try to extract the information they contain. 
Note  also  that,  instead  of  things,  active  attackers  can 
also target other infrastructures that store information, 
such as data processing or data storage entities. 

•  Controlling.  As  long  as  there  is  an  attack  path,  active 
attackers can try to gain partial or full control over an 
IoT  entity.  The  scope  of  the  damage  caused  by  these 
attackers depends mainly on (a) the importance of the 
data managed by that particular entity, (b) the services 
that are provided by that particular entity.

While  both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches 
share  the  same  attacker  models,  there  are  subtle  differ­
ences caused by the distributed IoT features and principles. 
They change various aspects of the underlying infrastruc­
tures,  such  as  the  deployment  strategies  of  the  different 
IoT entities, the actual information ﬂow, and the availabil­
ity of certain interfaces and services. Such changes can cre­
ate  new  threats  and  facilitate  the  work  of  attackers,  but 
also can reduce the effectiveness of certain attack vectors. 
In  the  following  paragraphs  we  will  discuss  the  different 
aspects that are inﬂuenced by the distributed IoT features 
and  principles,  and  how  they  impact  the  threats  and  at­
tacker models. 

One aspect is the centralization of resources. Most adver­
saries will aim to target systems that provide the biggest 
payoff, and central entities fall under this category – they 
store, manage, and process a huge amount of information. 
Theoretically, these central entities will have better protec­
tion  mechanisms,  but  any  vulnerability  can  make  the 
whole  system  fall  apart.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  actual 
intelligence  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  distributed,  the 
information will be created and processed in different enti­
ties, thus adversaries need to redouble their efforts in order 
to control the same amount of resources. However, the dis­
tribution  of  resources  is  a  double-edged  sword.  If  the 
adversary is only interested in a speciﬁc piece of informa­
tion, it can target the system that manages that particular 
information – which might not be as protected as a central 
entity. Besides, node capture attacks become more danger­
ous, as more logic is placed within the things themselves. 
In  fact,  an  adversary  can  use  a  guerrilla  warfare  strategy 
and  gradually  take  control  of  small  parts  of  the  network, 
so as to affect the whole system in a covert way. 

Another aspect, related to the centralization of resources, 
is  the  nature  of  the  information  ﬂow.  In  centralized  IoT 
deployments, the information ﬂow will follow a hierarchical 
pattern,  as  a  central  entity  will  receive  information  from 
every  ‘thing’.  On  the  other  hand,  in  more  distributed  ap­
proaches, the information ﬂow will resemble a peer-to-peer 
system, where information is only exchanged when needed. 
In  this  particular case, an  adversary  that  eavesdrops  on  a 
section of the network will not be able to obtain a holistic 
point of view of the whole system. There is a caveat here: 
if an adversary targets an intranet of things (e.g. an IoT-en­
abled hospital) in a distributed scenario, he might be able 
to retrieve processed information instead of raw data. 

Regarding the overall connectivity of the network, in ap­
proaches  that  follow  the  edge  intelligence  principle,  con­
strained entities are expected to be directly locatable and 
addressable via the Internet. Therefore, they must be able 
to accept connections from external entities. This situation 
allows  malicious  adversaries  to  launch  attacks  that  can 
easily exhaust their resources. Observe that this situation 
can  also  arise  in  networks  (either  centralized  or  distrib­
uted)  with  actuators  (e.g.  electric  motors,  industrial 
machinery), as the behavior of actuators can change when 
receiving  orders  from  remote  administrators.  Note  also 
that  it  is  possible  to  implement  additional  protection 
mechanisms  to  control  these  incoming  connections,  such 
as ﬁrewalls and additional middleware layers. 

Finally, we also have to consider the user involvement in 
the conﬁguration of the security mechanisms. User-centric 
networks, such as personal area networks [18], are one of 
the  elements  of  the  Internet  of  Things.  By  pushing  the 
intelligence  onto  the  edge  of  the  network,  it  is  possible 
for  the  owners  of  these  networks  to  create  and  manage 
their  own  policies  (cf.  Section  3.3.4).  However,  as  most 
users are not experts, mistakes will happen if the security 
mechanisms  are  not  usable  enough.  Such  misconﬁgura­
tions  can  be  exploited  by  malicious  adversaries  to  access 
personal data or even take control of that particular user-
centric network. Note that in centralized entities the con­
ﬁguration of the security mechanisms will be made by ex­
perts,  but  any  misconﬁguration  will  create  a  very 
rewarding  window  of  opportunity  that  can  be  exploited 
by any knowledgeable adversary. 

By  reviewing  these  attacker  models,  we  can  conclude 
that no approach is better in terms of threats and attacker 
models – all  of  them have  various advantages and disad­
vantages.  In  a  centralized  IoT  the  central  entity  becomes 
a single point of failure; and although the number of attack 
vectors are smaller (and the protection mechanisms might 
be better), a single vulnerability or a misconﬁguration can 
cause  extreme  damage  to  the  whole  network.  If  the  re­
sources of the network are distributed, the impact caused 
by a successful attack will be smaller, but the number of at­
tack vectors will increase. Note that in all approaches there 
will  be  a  huge  number  of  data  providers, the  things,  that 
can  be  highly  constrained  and  physically  accessible  –  in 
other  words,  easy  targets.  Therefore,  it  is  clear  that  any 
IoT application will have to deal with a certain amount of 
bogus data. 

3.3. Speciﬁc challenges and promising solutions 

Once the analysis of the threats and attacker models is 
ﬁnished, we can study what are the main challenges in the 
design and deployment of the security mechanisms. Such 
study,  which  will  be  performed  in  the  next  sections,  will 
help  to  point  out  speciﬁc  problems  that  must  be  consid­
ered if we want to bring the distributed IoT architectures 
to the real world. Moreover, within this study, we will ex­
plore not only existing IoT security mechanisms,  but also 
promising approaches that could be used to provide secu­
rity in a distributed IoT environment. 

3.3.1. Identity and authentication 

It  is  essential  to  consider  how  to  manage  identity and 
authentication in the Internet of Things, as multiple enti­
ties (e.g. data sources, service providers, information pro­
cessing systems) need to authenticate each other in order 
to create trustable services [25]. When deﬁning these secu­
rity  mechanisms,  we  also  have  to  consider  some  of  the 
inherent features of the Internet of Things. As interactions 
can  be  quite  dynamic,  the  entities  of  the  network  might 
not even know in advance which partners can be used to 
create  a  certain  service.  Vehicular  networks  (VANETs 
[26]) are an example of this: cars are expected to provide 
data  not  only  to  devices  located  on  the  roadside  but  also 
to other cars. Besides, if billions of things are going to be

interconnected, it is necessary to manage their identities in 
a scalable way. 

In a centralized IoT architecture, some of these challenges 
are inherently more simple. In this particular approach, the 
application  logic  is  mainly  located  in  one  central  entity 
(e.g. a cloud-based IoT application platform) that provides 
a  limited  set  of  well-known entry  points  (e.g.  APIs).  Both 
data providers, such as sensors, and information consum­
ers, such as user applications and other customers, connect 
to this central entity. As a consequence, all the authentica­
tion logic can be centralized in this entity or in an identity 
provider associated with it. In case there are data providers 
that have their own identity provider, there are no scalabil­
ity  problems,  as  such  identity  providers  can  establish  a 
relationship of trust with the central entity (a N-to-1 sce­
nario). Note that if an IoT complies with the collaboration 
principle (Collaborative IoT), it might be possible to make 
use  of  a  federated  identity  management  system,  where 
all the service providers belong to the same circle of trust. 
This simpliﬁcation cannot be found in purely distributed 
IoT  architectures,  which  fulﬁll  both  the  collaboration  and 
edge intelligence principles. In  this context  we ﬁnd  a dy­
namic N-to-N scenario, where data providers are no longer 
passive  and  are  able  to  acquire  and  process  information 
from other sources. Moreover, due to the edge intelligence 
principle, local users can query local information providers 
directly, without intervention from external entities. As a 
result, some kind of authentication logic must be present 
in every service provider – including the tiniest of objects. 
Note, however, that things do not exist in a vacuum: they 
usually belong to a speciﬁc group, are located in a particu­
lar  context,  and  are  owned  by  certain  entities.  These  as­
pects must be taken into account. 

3.3.1.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  aforementioned,  it  is 
essential to  manage  the  identities  of  the  things in  a  scal­
able  way.  However,  as  of  2012,  there  are  various  mecha­
nisms  that  can  be  used  to  identify  things  uniquely,  such 
as  the  tag  code  standards  EPC  and  ucode  [27].  Therefore, 
it is expected that in the future various systems will coex­
ist – not only at the universal level but also at a local scale 
[28].  Note,  however,  that  in  many  scenarios  the  ‘who’  is 
less important than the ‘where’ and the ‘what’. As a conse­
quence, things should be able to identify themselves using 
their  attributes  and  their  context  (e.g.  radiation  sensor 
#2044A can simply state that is a radiation sensor located 
in Shibuya, Tokyo). 

Regarding  things  authentication,  we  have  to  consider 
that  in  many  scenarios  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(e.g. intranets of things, personal area networks) located in 
the same spatial area (e.g. IoT-enabled hospitals). In such 
environments, local identity providers can manage the iden­
tities of those things, and also can create a circle of trust with 
relevant external resource providers (e.g. the household of a 
chronic patient, other hospitals). Consequently, local enti­
ties are not only able to authenticate to each other within 
the  group,  but  also  can  provide  a  proof  of  identity  when 
interacting  with  external  entities.  Also,  external  entities 
can  receive  a  temporary  persona  (e.g.  long-term  patient) 
from  the  local  identity  provider  if  necessary.  This  group-
based strategy has been, in fact, partially considered in the 

interactions between WSN islands, where interdomain col­
laboration is possible through federated identity manage­
ment and  access  tokens translation [29].  Traditional Web 
2.0 SSO such as OpenID and Shibboleth could also be used 
in this situation, although it should be noted that they were 
not designed to fulﬁll certain IoT requirements such as iden­
tity disclosure (i.e. support for privacy) [30], thus more anal­
yses are needed. 

If the thing is actually a human being, it can also be pos­
sible to use existing authentication mechanisms (e.g. web 
credentials,  electronic  identity  cards)  if  the  resource  pro­
vider  understands  them.  For  example,  Guinard  et  al.  [31] 
proposed  a  smart  gateway  infrastructure  (Social  Access 
Controller, or SAC) that allows users to retrieve data from 
local sensors using their social network (e.g. Facebook) cre­
dentials.  Note  that  this  approach  might  not  work  in  case 
the  human  being  does  not  directly  interact  with  the  IoT 
entities. In such cases, it is necessary to develop surrogate 
mechanisms  that  can  act  on  behalf  of  the  human  users. 
One existing example is the concept of the Minimal Entity 
(ME) [32] – a device that stores the digital identity of the 
user  and  acts  as  his  representative  in  the  virtual  world. 
Not only it does provide end-to-end secure communication 
and  collaboration  with  anonymous  receivers,  but  also  al­
lows  the  implementation  of  pseudonyms.  Another  exam­
ple  is  the  concept  of  a  digital  shadow  [33],  where  users 
can  delegate  their  credentials  (including  access  control 
credentials) to multiple objects or virtual entities. 

3.3.2. Access control 

In the Internet of Things, the challenges related to Access 
Control are closely related to those found in any distributed 
system. A particular service is constructed by aggregating 
several services and data sources from different locations 
and  contexts  (e.g.  a  hospital  retrieving  information  from 
home patients and ambulances). All these information pro­
viders will have their own access control policies and per­
missions  whose 
(creation,  enforcement, 
maintenance, translation) needs to be managed. 

life  cycle 

There are also some speciﬁc issues that must be taken 
into account in the context of the IoT. Granularity (i.e. pro­
viding more information to people with the right creden­
tials)  and  location  (i.e.  checking  whether  users  are 
accessing  the  services  of  a  thing  locally  or  remotely)  be­
come important elements of the access control policies in 
certain  scenarios.  For  example,  in  case  of  an  accident, 
everyone at the crash site can access my blood group, but 
only certiﬁed doctors and nurses can access my vital signs. 
Also,  whenever  access  control  mechanisms  are  imple­
mented  at  the  thing  level,  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the 
amount  of  computational  resources  that  are  available,  as 
constrained  devices  might  not  have  enough  space  to 
implement  a  complex  access  control  mechanism.  Finally, 
as  many  things  are  owned  by  their  users  (either  perma­
nently or temporarily) and may belong to a group (e.g. per­
sonal area network), it is necessary to consider the design 
of delegation mechanisms, as these things may act in the 
name of the user/group. 

As with authentication, access control policies are eas­
ier to manage in centralized IoT architectures: all access con­
trol policies are stored and managed within a single central

entity. Therefore, data providers do not need to implement 
any kind of access control logic: they will send all their data 
to those whom they trust (i.e. the central entity). As a side 
effect of this conﬁguration, both data providers and infor­
mation consumers must completely trust the central entity, 
as  it  will  store  the  information  generated  by  all  network 
entities. On the other hand, purely distributed IoT architec­
tures have to deal with all previously mentioned challenges: 
management of heterogeneous policies, multiple enforce­
ment points, etc. Nevertheless, as will be mentioned in Sec­
tion 3.3.4, the overall privacy of the network improves once 
the things can control directly who accesses their own data. 
Observe  that  additional  mechanisms  must  be  imple­
mented  whenever  the  collaboration  principle  is  applied 
to centralized IoT architectures (e.g. tools for maintaining 
consistency between access control lists, resource delega­
tion  mechanisms).  Note  also  that  we  need  to  manually 
conﬁgure  the  direct  links  between  the  intranets  and  the 
external  entities  in  networks  that  only  comply  with  the 
edge intelligence principle. 

3.3.2.1. Promising approaches.  There have been very few ad­
vances  in  the  management  of  access  control  policies  for 
distributed IoTs. In fact, it is not trivial to apply existing ac­
cess control approaches to completely distributed environ­
ments.  For  example,  there  are  scalability  and  consistency 
issues  when  storing  the  list  of  users  and  their  associated 
access rights in access control lists (ACLs). Role-based ac­
cess control (RBAC) mechanisms need to deﬁne the differ­
ent roles that users can take, which might be different in 
various contexts even if they refer to the same type of en­
tity  (e.g. custodian vs. janitor).  Finally, RBAC policies that 
use attribute certiﬁcates [34] need of an infrastructure that 
allows validating such certiﬁcates in a cross-domain envi­
ronment. Note, however, that due to the speciﬁc features of 
the Internet of Things, it is possible to consider certain fac­
tors  such  as  context  as  part  of  the  access  control  model 
[35].  As a consequence, with adequate technological  sup­
port, certain policies (e.g. only authenticated users located 
within  my  vicinity  during  working  hours  can  access  to­
day’s reports) can be easily implemented. 

Besides,  there  are  various  simple  strategies  that  could 
be  used  whenever  the  things  belong  to  a  certain  group 
(cf.  Section  3.3.1).  For  example,  the  access  control  logic 
could  be  pushed  to  speciﬁc  trusted  entities,  which  will 
act as token-granting services à la Kerberos (i.e. a thing will 
grant access to anyone that has a valid signature created by 
a  trusted  entity).  In  another  approach,  the  access  control 
logic  can  be  implemented  within  the  things  themselves, 
but relying only on locally-deﬁned roles (e.g. a doctor from 
another  hospital  must  retrieve  his  locally-issued  role  be­
fore  interacting  with  the  local  things).  A  drawback  of  all 
these strategies is that users must ﬁrst access the trusted 
entity before requesting information from the things. 

3.3.3. Protocol and network security 

A  secure  communications  channel  is,  in  most  cases,  a 
byproduct  of  a  successful  authentication  (e.g.  server 
authentication  or  mutual  authentication  using  protocols 
such  as  TLS/DTLS).  This  process  will  make  use  of  certain 
user credentials, such as shared keys or X.509 certiﬁcates. 

If there is a limited set of well-known centralized applica­
tion  providers  (i.e.  central  entities),  the  distribution  and 
management  of  these  credentials  becomes  easier,  as  it  is 
possible  to  preload  information  in  the  devices.  However, 
in  distributed  IoT  architectures,  extra  challenges  arise:  any 
entity can connect with any other entity at any time, these 
entities  might  not  know  each  other  in  advance,  and  also 
limited devices can exchange information with other lim­
ited  devices.  Therefore,  in  this  scenario  key  management 
becomes a signiﬁcant problem. 

There are some additional challenges related to the com­
putational resources available to things. When opening a se­
cure channel, devices should be able to negotiate the actual 
parameters of that channel, such as algorithms (e.g. RSA vs. 
ECC), strength (AES-128 vs. AES-256), and protection mech­
anisms (only integrity vs. conﬁdentiality and integrity). The 
ﬁrst  reason  is  obvious:  constrained  devices  might  not  be 
able to implement certain conﬁgurations. There is another 
reason, though: adaptability. Depending on various factors 
such as the level of criticality of the data, it might not be nec­
essary to apply strong protection mechanisms to a particu­
lar  information  ﬂow  (e.g.  conﬁdentiality  and  the  on/off 
status of a street light). Another challenge is the need to ana­
lyze  the  number  of  security  protocols  that  can  be  imple­
mented within a constrained device. In fact, it is necessary 
to  carefully  study  whether  existing  Internet  protocols 
should be adapted to this context or not. Finally, things that 
can  be  accessed  directly  (e.g.  in  the  distributed  IoT  ap­
proach)  need  to  be  careful about  the  overhead caused by 
incoming connections (e.g. multiple incoming connections 
that require the use of public key cryptography). 

3.3.3.1.  Promising  approaches.  As  the  Internet  of  Things 
inhabits the Internet ecosystem, it is important to provide 
support for existing security protocols. In fact, the security 
of IoT-designed web transfer protocols, such as CoAP (Con­
strained Application Protocol), is largely dependant on the 
implementation of these security protocols [36]. Some pro­
tocols can be implemented without any major changes. For 
example, there are commercial implementations available 
of DTLS for constrained devices [37]. However, other proto­
cols need to be adapted due to the complexity of their de­
sign.  Such  protocols  must  achieve  a  tradeoff  between 
simplicity  and  compatibility.  For  example,  one  approach 
seeks  to  apply  IPsec  to  constrained  environments by  bal­
ancing  link-layer  security  and  IPsec  security  (cf.  Raza 
et al. [38]). 

As for the distribution of the credentials, there are var­
ious strategies that could be used to tackle this problem. As 
aforementioned  (cf.  Sections  3.3.1  and  3.3.2),  whenever 
things  belong  to  a  particular  local  group,  it  is  possible  to 
have one or various entities in charge of managing and dis­
tributing  the  credentials.  Also,  in  scenarios  where  clients 
and servers know each other in advance, it is also possible 
to  use  certain  symmetric  key-based  protocols,  which  can 
provide good properties such as high resilience to attacks 
[39].  Finally,  beyond  the  optimization  of  these  security 
protocols, there are various researchers that  are pursuing 
the  implementation  of  fast  and  compact  cryptographic 
algorithms.  There  are  various  research  areas,  which  are 
not  mutually  exclusive:  from  the  design  of  novel  hash

functions and symmetric algorithms [40] to the optimiza­
tion of existing primitives [41]. 

3.3.4. Privacy 

Up to this point we have seen that a distributed IoT archi­
tecture requires more complex security mechanisms. There 
is, however, one area where distributed IoTs provide immedi­
ate beneﬁts: Data management and privacy. The core idea is 
that, due to the edge intelligence principle, every entity has 
more control over the data it generates and processes. There 
are several consequences of this approach. Firstly, entities 
can  control  the  granularity  of  the  data  they  produce.  For 
example, a portable radiation sensor can announce that it 
is located in a certain area without providing its exact coor­
dinates. Secondly, entities can deﬁne their own access poli­
cies. The previously mentioned object can provide the city 
where it is located (Tokyo) to anonymous entities, the area 
where it is deployed (Shibuya, Tokyo) to entities with ade­
quate permissions, or even detailed GPS location informa­
tion  to  local  entities  in  case  of  emergencies.  Thirdly, 
entities do not need to provide all the data they produce, 
only the data that is needed by the external entities for a par­
ticular service. This is closely related to privacy, as it will be 
more difﬁcult to create a proﬁle of a certain entity if not all 
information is available. 

As for centralized IoT architectures (including those who 
comply  with  the  collaboration  principle),  a  data  provider 
can  also  decide  whether  to  share  or  not  a  particular data 
stream. Still, as the intelligence is located on the central en­
tity, the type of services it provides will be limited to the 
amount of data it receives. Another approach can be used 
if the centralized architecture complies with the edge intel­
ligence  principle:  as  data  providers  and  information  con­
sumers  are  able  to  communicate  directly,  they  might 
negotiate a set of secret keys in order to protect their infor­
mation. However, in this case the central entity cannot pro­
cess  the  data,  thus  it  becomes  a  simple  storage  system 
unless it implements advanced cryptographic mechanisms 
that can manipulate encrypted data, such as homomorphic 
encryption. 

As a ﬁnal note, we have to point out that the previous 
paragraphs  focus  mainly  on  the  protection  of  personal 
information, but there is another dimension of privacy that 
is  especially  relevant  in  the  context  of  the  IoT:  the  exis­
tence of entities that proﬁle and track users without their 
consent. Here, the beneﬁts of a distributed IoT might turn 
into  nightmares  when  misused.  By  following  the  edge 
intelligence  principle,  entities  can  adapt  their  behavior 
and track users more effectively. Moreover, thanks to the 
collaboration principle, these entities can share up-to-date 
information about the target. 

3.3.4.1. Promising approaches.  The distributed IoT approach 
facilitates  the  implementation  of  the  privacy-by-design 
principles  [24],  as  all  entities  can  directly  manage  their 
own data. However, it is necessary to go beyond the imple­
mentation of user-centric access policies and mechanisms 
to control the granularity of the provided data. Whenever 
human beings are involved, aspects such as the usability of 
the user interface (e.g. what can be accessed and to what ex­
tent [42]) should be taken into account. As data will be dis­

tributed  amongst  various  entities,  it  also  is  necessary  to 
study  the  applicability  of  existing  privacy-preserving  dis­
tributed data mining algorithms [43]. For example, certain 
privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) [44] such as multi­
party computations [45] can be used to provide protection 
to some cooperative protocols (e.g. cooperative benchmark­
ing and forecasting). For especially sensitive data, advanced 
concepts such as active bundles (i.e. a container with a pay­
load of sensitive data, metadata, and a virtual machine (VM) 
[46])  might be  used. Finally, the legal  privacy regulations 
should be revised to fully consider the intricacies of an al­
ways connected Internet of Things [47]. 

Regarding  the  problem  of  user  tracking  and  proﬁling, 
there are some ongoing efforts in the research community 
that aim to provide solutions for this particular threat. For 
example, there is an interesting perspective that considers 
a local environment as an operative system [48]. In short, 
incoming and outgoing items need to be scanned for rogue 
devices and malicious software that can threaten the pri­
vacy  of  the  user.  This  can  be  achieved  by  using  mecha­
nisms  such  as  the  privacy  coach  [49].  However,  as  users 
could  be  tracked  anywhere  and  anytime,  these  concepts 
should be extended in order to help users to become more 
aware  of  how  their  surroundings  capture  and  use  their 
information.  Frameworks  like  uTRUSTit  (cf.  Section  3.3.5) 
might help in this area. Besides, existing studies on surveil­
lance systems such as CCTVs [50] might also provide a clue 
on  the  speciﬁc  legal  challenges  that  our  society  will  face 
once the Internet of Things becomes a reality. 

3.3.5. Trust and governance 

There  are  other  areas  where  both  centralized  and  dis­
tributed  IoT  approaches  have  their  own  speciﬁc  advanta­
ges  and  disadvantages.  One  of  those  areas  is  Trust 
Management.  As  aforementioned,  in  the  IoT  we  can  con­
sider two dimensions of trust: trust in the interactions be­
tween  entities,  and  trust  in  the  system  from  the  users’ 
perspective.  In  a  centralized  IoT,  uncertainty  comes  from 
the  interactions  with  the  data  providers  (‘Which  data  is 
more reliable  and  fresh?’). The  holistic  point of  view  of  a 
central  entity  can  help  in  calculating  the  reputation  of 
other entities (e.g. a radiation sensor cannot give a warning 
if all sensors in the vicinity provide a low value). However, 
if  different  central  entities  collaborate  with  each  other, 
they must be able to exchange trust information in order 
to ﬁx inconsistencies in the reputation values. In a distrib­
uted IoT, there is uncertainty in both the interactions with 
the  data  providers  and  the  interactions  with  the  service 
providers (‘Who can give me a robust and timely service?’). 
The  distributed  infrastructure  makes  the  management  of 
trust more complicated: how can reputation and trust be 
calculated and shared? Which ontology should I use? Can 
I  trust  the  reports  from  other  systems?  Still,  these  trust 
management systems can make better use of second-hand 
information sources: when a certain entity is given a low 
reputation, this reputation can be propagated to other enti­
ties that might interact with such an outlier in the future. 
As for the trust in the system, it is largely dependant on 
knowing  the  internal  state  of  the  Internet  of  Things  that 
surround  us.  In  a  centralized  IoT  not  all  information  will 
be available: in order to provide services, a central entity

11 

is more interested in retrieving physical and entity data in­
stead of status and network data. Still, if a centralized sys­
tem provides an additional ‘internal status’ service, it can 
be  able  to  supply  this  kind  of  information  very  quickly, 
as  (a)  it  stores  internally  most  of  the  information  from 
the data providers and (b) if fresh data is not available, it 
can send immediate queries to the speciﬁc data providers. 
As for a distributed IoT, this kind of service is more complex 
and  needs  more  time  to  be  completed,  as  relevant  data 
providers  must  be  discovered  and  queried.  Nevertheless, 
the more intelligence at the edge of the network, the more 
relevant information (e.g. network status, existing connec­
tions between entities) that can be retrieved. This way, it 
can be possible to have a more accurate picture of the sta­
tus of the whole system. 

Regarding  the  issues  associated  with  Governance,  it  is 
not clear how this problem will be solved in the context of 
the IoT [51], although the distributed IoT approach can pro­
vide some solutions. As policies in a distributed IoT can be 
deﬁned at the edge of the network, it could be possible to 
implement  and  enforce  certain  rules  such  as  limiting  the 
countries that can access to our data. This is not possible 
in a centralized system, whose data servers will be located 
in most cases in foreign countries. Still, as with many other 
security mechanisms, a distributed IoT needs to implement 
various  distributed  mechanisms  to  control  and  enforce 
these policies, which is not trivial. This same problem affects 
the management of accountability in the IoT. As logging sub­
systems will be distributed throughout the network, it will 
be more difﬁcult to retrieve all the relevant information that 
might be needed for forensic analysis. There is one clear ben­
eﬁt, though: if a balance between accountability and privacy 
is achieved, it will be possible to pinpoint the source of a par­
ticular problem thanks to the detailed information about the 
behavior of the system. 

3.3.5.1.  Promising  approaches.  There  are  some  theoretical 
studies  that  analyze  the  suitability  of  trust  management 
systems for the IoT. For example, Køien [52] points out that 
subjective logic systems such as TNA-SL [53] can capture dy­
namic  environments  where  beliefs  and  uncertainties 
change over time. There are other open issues that the state 
of the art needs to address, such as the management of trust 
without central authorities. Still, it might be possible to de­
velop preliminary solutions for such problems by analyzing 
how they are solved in the building blocks of the Internet of 
Things (e.g. sensor networks, ad hoc networks). The reason 
is  simple:  these  building  blocks  have  several  features  in 
common  with  the  distributed  IoT  approach.  For  example, 
ad hoc networks are dynamic environments where the net­
work is created, operated and managed by the nodes them­
selves. In such networks, the decentralization of trust, which 
is essential in a distributed IoT context, has been extensively 
studied [54]. Moreover, there are other holistic paradigms 
closely related  to  the  Internet  of  Things, such  as  ambient 
intelligence  and  pervasive  computing,  whose  existing 
works in the area might also provide additional information 
on how to deal with multidisciplinary challenges [55]. 

All the previous approaches do not consider the interac­
tions between human beings and IoT entities. In fact, as the 
Internet  of  Things  can  (and  will)  contain  user-generated 

content, we also have to ask ourselves how to model this 
type  of  trust.  One  promising  approach  is  the  existence  of 
user-managed  circles  of  trust,  as  described  in  the  shop­
pingLense system by Robinson et al. [56]. This system in­
creases  users’  trust  in  the  IoT  by  including  trusted 
metadata  in  the  information  ﬂow.  In  particular,  patterns 
(e.g. QR  codes) located in the environment (e.g.  shopping 
mall)  are  digitally  signed  and  owned  by  a  user-deﬁned 
group. Members of that group can also add ratings to a par­
ticular pattern. This way, if a user trusts a particular group, 
it  can  acquire  both  information  from  the  pattern  and 
trusted  ratings  from  other  users.  Finally,  regarding  the 
trust in the system from the users’ perspective, one partic­
ular research project (uTRUSTit [57]) has already produced 
promising results in this area. In particular, the framework 
developed in this project not only provides an inventory of 
the  local  devices  that  are  connected  to  the  Internet  of 
Things, but also enables users to know their status, allow­
ing the creation of a mental model of the virtual world. 

3.3.6. Fault tolerance 

Regardless  of  the  approach,  centralized  or  distributed, 
there  is  an  expected  population  of  billions  of  things  that 
will  act  as  data  and  information  providers.  Such  things 
can  become  faulty  and  stop  working,  but  they  also  can 
send  bogus  or  even  manipulated  data.  As  mentioned  in 
Section 3.2, it is unrealistic to assume that a data process­
ing  entity  will  never  have  to  deal  with  such  problematic 
data. Therefore, in the IoT context, it is essential to consider 
fault tolerance. We must not only aim to provide a ‘best-ef­
fort’ service in case parts of the network are not accessible, 
but also assume that every entity can receive bogus infor­
mation from other entities. 

In case one of the things fails and stops sending data, it 
is  necessary  to  discover  another  thing  that  can  provide  a 
similar set of data. In centralized IoT architectures this task 
is  more  simple,  as  the  central  entity  will  have  access  to 
all data ﬂows. As for distributed IoT architectures, they need 
to develop a discovery mechanism that is able to pinpoint 
related data ﬂows. Note that additional mechanisms need 
to  be  implemented  in  order  to  assure  the  survivability of 
the  network  in  case  of  a  failure  of  part  of  the  infrastruc­
ture: not only data providers need to be located, but also 
service providers and data processing entities as well. 

As for the existence of bogus data, it is possible to devel­
op holistic (centralized) and detailed (distributed) mecha­
nisms that deal with this problem. A centralized system can 
analyze the consistency of the data, pinpointing data pro­
viders who seem to behave erratically. A distributed system 
can  make  use  of  the  additional  information  (e.g.  network 
information) retrieved at a local level or in the interactions 
with other  entities to  apply  advanced intrusion detection 
systems.  Both  approaches  have  their  own  challenges,  but 
they are not mutually exclusive (e.g. in a distributed envi­
ronment there can be certain entities that provide high-le­
vel 
IoT 
infrastructures), thus it is advisable to take full advantage 
of both of them if possible.

to  provide  service  survivability  in  the  IoT.  Still,  there  are 
various research approaches that can be used as a founda­
tion to enable such fault tolerance. For example, the tools 
that allow human users to create a mental model of their 
surroundings  (highlighted  in  Section  3.3.5)  can  also  be 
used  by  the  network  entities  to  discover  devices  that  are 
faulty. There are also various theoretical platforms whose 
aim is to provide service look-up, discovery and composi­
tion mechanisms for the Internet of Things [58]. However, 
it is necessary to study their applicability in an heteroge­
neous  distributed  environment.  The  use  of  local  clusters 
can  help  with  this  task:  if  entities  are  clustered  in  local 
groups, that cluster can incorporate mechanisms that not 
only  provide  up-to-date  information  about  local  things, 
but also enable the interaction of different service discov­
ery  protocols  through  specialized  middleware  [58].  Be­
sides, all these services can make use of the functionality 
provided  by  existing  security  mechanisms  such  as  trust 
management  (e.g.  only  reports  from  trusted  entities  will 
be  considered,  zones  with  high  reputation  will  take  care 
of the extra workload). 

Regarding  the  detection  of  bogus  data  and  malicious 
entities,  most  existing  intrusion  detection  mechanisms 
and  rules  focus  on  internal  adversaries  that  try  to  attack 
the speciﬁc protocols of data acquisition networks (e.g. sen­
sor networks) [59], but do not consider attacks that target 
the interactions between different IoT domains (e.g. a DoS 
attack or a malformed packet attack targeting a smart door 
service [60]). In fact, the state of the art on this speciﬁc area 
is very limited and only few works are available [61,62]. It is 
then  necessary  to  implement  new  detection  mechanisms 
that take into account the distributed IoT speciﬁc attacker 
models. Note that it is also possible, in certain scenarios, to 
adapt existing mechanisms. For example, centralized enti­
ties  can  make  use  of  clustering-based  mechanisms  and 
other data mining techniques to detect outliers and intru­
sions [63]. Moreover, lessons might be taken from existing 
distributed  intrusion  detection  systems  implemented  in 
similar environments such as smart grids [64]. 

3.4. Summary 

A summary of the challenges studied in the previous sec­
tions is shown in Table 2. We can conclude that the decen­
tralized  and  heterogeneous  nature  of  the  distributed 
approach increases the complexity of most security mecha­
nisms  (Identity  and  Authentication,  Access  Control,  Protocol 
and  Network  Security,  Trust  management  and  Fault  Toler­
ance).  Still,  there  are  some  security  mechanisms  (Privacy, 
Trust  management  and  Governance,  Fault  Tolerance)  where 

i)  the  distributed  approach  provides  interesting  features, 
ii) both approaches (centralized and distributed) can com­
plement each other. 

In the previous sections we have also highlighted various 
strategies that could be used in the near future to design and 
deploy IoT-speciﬁc security mechanisms. One such strategy 
assumes that things belong to a certain group (intranet of 
things, personal area network) located in a certain spatial 
area (IoT-enabled hospital, household). These groups com­
ply with the edge intelligence and collaboration principles, 
thus  they  are  part  of  the  distributed  IoT.  Once  the  things 
are grouped, the implementation of certain security mecha­
nisms becomes easier: local identity providers can be de­
ﬁned, the access control logic can be pushed onto speciﬁc 
entities, a mental model of the virtual world can be created, 
and so on. Note that this strategy might be partially applica­
ble to highly dynamic environments such as VANETs [26] if 
we consider the existence of logical groups (‘‘all cars that 
have  been  registered  in  Singapore’’),  although  more  re­
search is needed to validate this point of view. 

Other strategies focus on the interactions of human users 
with the  Internet  of Things.  For  example, as  digital social 
infrastructures  have  been  already  deployed,  they  can  be 
used in the implementation of speciﬁc security mechanisms 
such as user-deﬁned access control and circles of trust. Fi­
nally,  another  strategy  consists  of  adapting  the  security 
mechanisms  that  have  been  developed  in  i)  the  building 
blocks  of  the  Internet  of  Things  (e.g.  sensor  networks,  ad 
hoc  networks)  and  ii)  other  paradigms  closely  related  to 
the Internet of Things (ambient intelligence, pervasive com­
puting). Note that while the building blocks lack the com­
plexity of the distributed IoT approach, they share certain 
similarities such as the decentralization of resources. In fact, 
some security mechanisms, such as Key Management, have 
been successfully adapted to certain IoT scenarios [39]. 

4. Conclusions 

The main goal of this paper was to provide an explicit 
analysis of the features and security challenges of the dis­
tributed  approach  of  the  Internet  of  Things,  in  order  to 
understand what is its place in the Future Internet. There 
are numerous challenges that must be solved, such as assur­
ing interoperability, reaching a business model, and manag­
ing  the  authentication  and  authorization  of  entities.  Still, 
there are multiple beneﬁts as well. Since intelligence is not 
concentrated  on  a  limited  set  of  centralized  application 
platforms  –  although 
can  also 
exist in order to provide additional support – scalability is 
improved. Data is managed by the distributed entities, thus 

these  platforms

it is possible not only to push/pull data only when needed, 
but  also  to  implement  speciﬁc  privacy  policies.  Besides, 
additional trust and fault tolerance mechanisms can be spe­
ciﬁcally created for this approach. These and other beneﬁts 
show that this approach is actually useful and applicable to 
the real world. As a ﬁnal note, we would like to stress that 
both  centralized  and  distributed  approaches  can  coexist 
with each other, providing the foundations of a full-ﬂedged 
Internet of Things.

Dr.  Rodrigo  Roman  (roman@lcc.uma.es)  is  a 
security  researcher  working  at  the  Institute 
for Infocomm Research (I2R) in Singapore. He 
also collaborates with the NICS security lab at 
the  University  of  Malaga,  Spain,  where  he 
obtained  his  Ph.D.  in  Computer  Science  in 
2008. From his point of view, security should 
not  be  an  obscure  concept  that  is  difﬁcult  to 
apply,  but  a  simple  idea  that  can  be  easily 
explained  and  deployed.  Consequently,  His 
research is mainly focused on providing  use­
ful and  relevant security solutions that fulﬁll 
the  requirements  of  both  applications  and  its  users.  At  present,  his 
research interests are mainly focused on the secure integration of sensor
