SUMMARY

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that improve

domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid integration

into globalization of production, and leap-frogging of available technology.  Since electronic

commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception, negotiating on

trade issues related to electronic commerce will, even more than trade negotiations have in the

past, demand self-inspection of key domestic policies, particularly in telecommunications,

financial services, and distribution and delivery.  Because these sectors are fundamental to the

workings of a modern economy, liberalization here will rebound to greater economic well-being

than comparable liberalization in more narrowly focussed sectors.  Thus, the desire to be part of

the e-commerce wave can be a powerful force to erode domestic vested interests that have slowed

the liberalization of these sectors.

Technical aspects of electronic commerce, its complexity and the characteristic of

network externalities should change the way that developing countries approach the external

negotiating process.  Specifically, the complexity of negotiations will require more cooperative

effort among countries through their regional forums (APEC, FTAA) which heretofore have

operated at the periphery of the WTO process.  Second, since electronic commerce is

characterized by network externalities, developing countries should take advantage of the

technical leadership coming out of the private sector in the most advanced countries (and their

own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft” in behind. Standing on the shoulders of giants

makes sense when network externalities and interoperable standards are key to maximizing the

benefits of e-commerce. Trying to develop domestic standards or following the old technique of

import substitution to develop a domestic industry is even more economically wasteful in the

context of the internet and electronic commerce than it was in more traditional sectors.

Trade negotiations are often the tool used to liberalize domestic sectors.  But the

complementarity between domestic policy and trade strategy is tighter in the case of e-commerce

and the internet.  Moreover, this complementarity emphasizes that e-commerce is not a service,

nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the context of the WTO commitments,

embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of electronic delivery of goods and

services as compared to delivery by another scheduled mode.  For example, insurance products

could be sold over the Internet even if the physical presence of a foreign insurance firm was not

scheduled for liberalization under GATS. Rather than view this outcome with alarm, developing

countries should embrace it as a positive force that furthers the development both of electronic

commerce, as well as encourages deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MERGES THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL
MARKETPLACES

“Electronic commerce” is a shorthand term that embraces a complex amalgam of technologies,

infrastructures, processes, and products.  It brings together whole industries and narrow

applications, producers and users, information exchange and economic activity into a global

marketplace called “the Internet.”  There is no universal definition of electronic commerce

because the Internet marketplace and its participants are so numerous and their intricate
relationships are evolving so rapidly.1  Nonetheless, one of the best ways of understanding
electronic commerce is to consider the elements of its infrastructure, its impact on the traditional

marketplace, and the continuum of ways in which electronic commerce is manifested.  This

approach shows clearly how electronic commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic

economic activity and international trade.

Electronic commerce as it has evolved today requires three types of infrastructure:

•  Technological infrastructure to create an Internet marketplace.  Electronic commerce relies
on a variety of technologies, the development of which are proceeding at breakneck speeds

(e.g., interconnectivity among telecommunications, cable, satellite, or other Internet

‘backbone;’ Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect market participants to that backbone;

and end-user devices such as PCs, TVs, or mobile telephones).

•  Process infrastructure to connect the Internet marketplace to the traditional marketplace.

This infrastructure makes payment over the Internet possible (through credit, debit, or Smart

cards, or through online currencies).  It also makes possible the distribution and delivery

(whether online or physical) of those products purchased over the Internet to the consumer.
•  “Infrastructure” of protocols, laws, and regulations.  This infrastructure affects the conduct

of those businesses engaging in and impacted by electronic commerce, as well as the

relationships between businesses, consumers, and government.  Examples include technical

communications and interconnectivity standards; the legality and modality of digital

signatures, certification, and encryption; and disclosure, privacy, and content regulations.

 

Together, these infrastructures enable electronic commerce to innovate the traditional

marketplace in three ways:
•  Process innovations: Electronic commerce simplifies, makes more efficient, reduces costs, or
otherwise alters the process by which an existing transaction takes place.  For example, Cisco

Systems replaced its phone and fax ordering process with an online ordering process and
saved more than one-half billion dollars and reduced error rates from 25 percent to 2 percent.2
Boeing used computer-aided design and electronic communication to coordinate 238 design

this way, and which cut error rates by 50 percent, and reduced both costs and time to market.3

thereby creating a new medium to produce and consume music; WebMD repackages existing

health information in an easy-to-use online format, offers opportunities to “chat” with people

with similar health concerns, and provides “real-time” responses to health questions.

•  Market innovations: Electronic commerce also creates new markets in time, space, and in
information that heretofore did not exist because transaction and coordination costs were

prohibitively high.  For example, the online bank Wingspan offers 24-hour bill payment

features; PeopleLink is a global advertising location for artisans in remote parts of Latin

America and Africa; reverse auctions through Priceline inform businesses of the exact price a

consumer is willing to pay for the products, as well as reduce the consumer’s purchase cost.

In reviewing the infrastructures that make electronic commerce possible, as well as the

impact electronic commerce has on the traditional marketplace, we can see how electronic

commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic economic activity and international

trade.
•  The infrastructures on which e-commerce depends also are key to domestic activity.  The

three service-sector infrastructures of telecoms, financial services, and distribution and

delivery are critical components for overall economic activity.  Comprehensive liberalization

of services could raise global GDP by 4 to 6 percentage points—twice that credited to the
Uruguay Round—as well as raise the long-run global growth rate from 3.2 to 5.0 percent.4
While the transition to liberalization is  almost never without cost, liberalizing services

promises more comprehensive benefits since services are an input to production in virtually

all sectors of the economy.  In contrast, liberalization of selected goods sectors has a narrower

conduit through which it affects the overall economy.

•  Electronic commerce is global from the very start.  While traditional borders still matter in

the world of international trade, electronic commerce diminishes their importance.  No longer

do customers need to be physically present to see or hear what they are buying.  As a result,

companies on the Internet instantly become international: Amazon was selling books to

customers in over 40 countries in its first month of existence; the company now sells a variety

of products to customers in over 160 countries. The electronic marketplace is currently free

from explicit trade barriers.  The absence of international tariffs or other barriers on electronic

commerce encourages more people to try and to continue using the internet marketplace,

creating a greater level of efficiency and economic benefit for its participants.

•  Electronic commerce is integral to existing WTO commitments.  While there are currently no

explicit trade barriers on electronic commerce, the infrastructures that make electronic

commerce possible are still burdened by a myriad of trade and investment barriers.  The

growth of electronic commerce depends on continued liberalization of these infrastructures,

many of which are already part of WTO commitments.  Most important are computers and

other information technology products (covered by ITA I and under consideration for ITA II),

telecommunications (covered by the Basic Telecommunications Agreement), financial

services (addressed in the Financial Services Agreement), distribution (relevant under

TRIMS), and delivery services (under consideration for GATS 2000), among others.

Exploiting the synergies among these service sectors allows electronic commerce to flourish

and maximizes economic benefits.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS AN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY

SUMMARY

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that improve

domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid integration

into globalization of production, and leap-frogging of available technology.  Since electronic

commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception, negotiating on

trade issues related to electronic commerce will, even more than trade negotiations have in the

past, demand self-inspection of key domestic policies, particularly in telecommunications,

financial services, and distribution and delivery.  Because these sectors are fundamental to the

workings of a modern economy, liberalization here will rebound to greater economic well-being

than comparable liberalization in more narrowly focussed sectors.  Thus, the desire to be part of

the e-commerce wave can be a powerful force to erode domestic vested interests that have slowed

the liberalization of these sectors.

Technical aspects of electronic commerce, its complexity and the characteristic of

network externalities should change the way that developing countries approach the external

negotiating process.  Specifically, the complexity of negotiations will require more cooperative

effort among countries through their regional forums (APEC, FTAA) which heretofore have

operated at the periphery of the WTO process.  Second, since electronic commerce is

characterized by network externalities, developing countries should take advantage of the

technical leadership coming out of the private sector in the most advanced countries (and their

own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft” in behind. Standing on the shoulders of giants

makes sense when network externalities and interoperable standards are key to maximizing the

benefits of e-commerce. Trying to develop domestic standards or following the old technique of

import substitution to develop a domestic industry is even more economically wasteful in the

context of the internet and electronic commerce than it was in more traditional sectors.

Trade negotiations are often the tool used to liberalize domestic sectors.  But the

complementarity between domestic policy and trade strategy is tighter in the case of e-commerce

and the internet.  Moreover, this complementarity emphasizes that e-commerce is not a service,

nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the context of the WTO commitments,

embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of electronic delivery of goods and

services as compared to delivery by another scheduled mode.  For example, insurance products

could be sold over the Internet even if the physical presence of a foreign insurance firm was not

scheduled for liberalization under GATS. Rather than view this outcome with alarm, developing

countries should embrace it as a positive force that furthers the development both of electronic

commerce, as well as encourages deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MERGES THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL
MARKETPLACES

“Electronic commerce” is a shorthand term that embraces a complex amalgam of technologies,

infrastructures, processes, and products.  It brings together whole industries and narrow

applications, producers and users, information exchange and economic activity into a global

marketplace called “the Internet.”  There is no universal definition of electronic commerce

because the Internet marketplace and its participants are so numerous and their intricate
relationships are evolving so rapidly.1  Nonetheless, one of the best ways of understanding
electronic commerce is to consider the elements of its infrastructure, its impact on the traditional

marketplace, and the continuum of ways in which electronic commerce is manifested.  This

approach shows clearly how electronic commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic

economic activity and international trade.

Electronic commerce as it has evolved today requires three types of infrastructure:

•  Technological infrastructure to create an Internet marketplace.  Electronic commerce relies
on a variety of technologies, the development of which are proceeding at breakneck speeds

(e.g., interconnectivity among telecommunications, cable, satellite, or other Internet

‘backbone;’ Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect market participants to that backbone;

and end-user devices such as PCs, TVs, or mobile telephones).

•  Process infrastructure to connect the Internet marketplace to the traditional marketplace.

This infrastructure makes payment over the Internet possible (through credit, debit, or Smart

cards, or through online currencies).  It also makes possible the distribution and delivery

(whether online or physical) of those products purchased over the Internet to the consumer.
•  “Infrastructure” of protocols, laws, and regulations.  This infrastructure affects the conduct

of those businesses engaging in and impacted by electronic commerce, as well as the

relationships between businesses, consumers, and government.  Examples include technical

communications and interconnectivity standards; the legality and modality of digital

signatures, certification, and encryption; and disclosure, privacy, and content regulations.

 

Together, these infrastructures enable electronic commerce to innovate the traditional

marketplace in three ways:
•  Process innovations: Electronic commerce simplifies, makes more efficient, reduces costs, or
otherwise alters the process by which an existing transaction takes place.  For example, Cisco

Systems replaced its phone and fax ordering process with an online ordering process and
saved more than one-half billion dollars and reduced error rates from 25 percent to 2 percent.2
Boeing used computer-aided design and electronic communication to coordinate 238 design

teams in the globalized production of the 777 aircraft, a process never before attempted in
this way, and which cut error rates by 50 percent, and reduced both costs and time to market.3
•  Product innovations:  Electronic commerce creates or facilitates new industries and products

not previously available.  For example, MP3 both enables consumers to play music

downloaded from a computer and enables musicians to upload music directly to the internet,

thereby creating a new medium to produce and consume music; WebMD repackages existing

health information in an easy-to-use online format, offers opportunities to “chat” with people

with similar health concerns, and provides “real-time” responses to health questions.

•  Market innovations: Electronic commerce also creates new markets in time, space, and in
information that heretofore did not exist because transaction and coordination costs were

prohibitively high.  For example, the online bank Wingspan offers 24-hour bill payment

features; PeopleLink is a global advertising location for artisans in remote parts of Latin

America and Africa; reverse auctions through Priceline inform businesses of the exact price a

consumer is willing to pay for the products, as well as reduce the consumer’s purchase cost.

In reviewing the infrastructures that make electronic commerce possible, as well as the

impact electronic commerce has on the traditional marketplace, we can see how electronic

commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic economic activity and international

trade.
•  The infrastructures on which e-commerce depends also are key to domestic activity.  The

three service-sector infrastructures of telecoms, financial services, and distribution and

delivery are critical components for overall economic activity.  Comprehensive liberalization

of services could raise global GDP by 4 to 6 percentage points—twice that credited to the
Uruguay Round—as well as raise the long-run global growth rate from 3.2 to 5.0 percent.4
While the transition to liberalization is  almost never without cost, liberalizing services

promises more comprehensive benefits since services are an input to production in virtually

all sectors of the economy.  In contrast, liberalization of selected goods sectors has a narrower

conduit through which it affects the overall economy.

•  Electronic commerce is global from the very start.  While traditional borders still matter in

the world of international trade, electronic commerce diminishes their importance.  No longer

do customers need to be physically present to see or hear what they are buying.  As a result,

companies on the Internet instantly become international: Amazon was selling books to

customers in over 40 countries in its first month of existence; the company now sells a variety

of products to customers in over 160 countries. The electronic marketplace is currently free

from explicit trade barriers.  The absence of international tariffs or other barriers on electronic

commerce encourages more people to try and to continue using the internet marketplace,

creating a greater level of efficiency and economic benefit for its participants.

•  Electronic commerce is integral to existing WTO commitments.  While there are currently no

explicit trade barriers on electronic commerce, the infrastructures that make electronic

commerce possible are still burdened by a myriad of trade and investment barriers.  The

growth of electronic commerce depends on continued liberalization of these infrastructures,

many of which are already part of WTO commitments.  Most important are computers and

other information technology products (covered by ITA I and under consideration for ITA II),

telecommunications (covered by the Basic Telecommunications Agreement), financial

services (addressed in the Financial Services Agreement), distribution (relevant under

TRIMS), and delivery services (under consideration for GATS 2000), among others.

Exploiting the synergies among these service sectors allows electronic commerce to flourish

and maximizes economic benefits.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS AN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY

Estimates of the growth of internet usage and electronic commerce both within domestic markets

and worldwide are notorious for their hyperbole.  Even so, each year the actual growth has

surpassed the estimate rather than falling short of it.  Respected sources such as Forrester

Research expect worldwide electronic commerce revenues to surpass $300 billion by 2002 and

accelerate to $1.3 trillion in 2003.  Currently an overwhelming (close to 85%) share of electronic

commerce is concentrated in the United States, but diffusion into Europe and Asia, followed by

Latin America and Africa will be rapid.

In developing countries internet use and its economic potential are growing

exponentially.  The share of active internet users in Asia/Pacific Rim, Latin America, and “rest of
world” could increase from 23 percent in 1999 to 35 percent in 2002.5   In India, for example, the
number of internet users nearly doubled in the last year to 270,000, and could rise to over 2
million by the end of 2000.6  E-commerce revenues could jump from $2.8 million in 1998 to
$575 million in 2002.  In China, a reported 60 percent of businesses are using the internet, and e-
commerce revenues could rise from $11.7 million in 1998 to $1.9 billion in 2002.7  In Latin
America, internet usage rose nearly eight-fold between 1995 and 1997 with revenues estimated to
be $167 million in 1998 and projected to be $8 billion by 2003.8 Africa is fully wired now that
Somalia recently added its first ISP; in South Africa, electronic commerce is expected to generate
US $1.1 billion in 1999.9

Two important facts about e-commerce are often overlooked.  First, the vast bulk of the

actual and to an even greater extent the expected growth in revenues from e-commerce comes

from business-to-business transactions.  In 1998, the ratio of B-to-B over B-to-C was 5.5 to 1; but

by 2003 the ratio is expected to be 12 to 1. Second, in virtually all countries other than the United

States, electronic commerce is export oriented.  In the US, the share of export sales in total e-

commerce revenues is only 10 percent, but in Canada it is 83 percent, in Latin America it
averages 79 percent, and in Asia/Pacific it is 38 percent.10

Moreover, the nature of the production process (comprising both manufacturing and

services) is becoming increasingly fragmented and globalized.11  Multinational firms and strategic
business alliances communicate, get price quotes, submit bids, transfer data, produce product

designs, and basically do business in an international arena.  Countries that do not have an

environment conducive to internet usage and electronic commerce will be marginalized from the

globalized production process and global economy, at increasingly great cost to their citizens.

These observations have important implications for both domestic policy and

international negotiations.  First, business to business transactions often build on existing legal

and regulatory foundations from physical trade so that issues of content, liability, and encryption

are more easily surmounted.  On the other hand, the importance of B-to-B and the desire to create

a level-playing field for all size businesses highlight the need for the international arena to offer a

transparent and codified approach to these issues.

DOMESTIC REFORMS WILL SPEED THE UPTAKE OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Developing countries need to address a number of socioeconomic and regulatory barriers before

their electronic commerce and internet use matches that of the United States or Europe.  While

the socioeconomic challenges are difficult to surmount and will be slower to achieve, the path to

reducing regulatory barriers is clearer and the benefits quicker to observe.  High Internet access

rates, low penetration of electronic means of payment (such as credit, debit, or Smart cards), and

cumbersome delivery systems are primary obstacles to the growth of electronic commerce in

developing countries.

One area that is most easily quantified and compared is internet monthly access fees.

ITU data show that these fees vary substantially across countries and that the share of the fees

accounted for by ISP charges versus accounted for by local telephone charges also varies

substantially.  For example, in the US, the approximately $20 per month internet access charge is

all an ISP charge.  In Korea, the $25 charge is about 1/3 ISP charge and 2/3 local call charges. In

Brazil, the $37 charge is nearly all a local ISP charge.  In China, the $65 charge is about half ISP
charge and about half a local phone charge.12 More importantly, when adjusted by the level of per
capita GDP, the differences in charges is tremendous.  For example, in the US and Australia fees

are about $25 per month, accounting for less than 2 percent of monthly GDP per capita.   In

contrast, in Mexico, the fee at about $27 per month accounts for about 5 percent of monthly

income and in Mozambique, that $27 per month accounts for about 70 percent of monthly GDP
per capita.13

Because the internet creates a new electronic businesses environment, “surfing” is a key

way for users to see what businesses are now doing, and what market niches remain to be

exploited.  Consequently, large “entry” and on-going costs are a great disincentive to internet

usage and therefore to the development of e-commerce business both within a country and for

international trade.  Competition, both for telephone access as well as among ISPs is a key area

where government policy can make a difference in access and uptake of the internet.

Second, a supportive electronic payments infrastructure is crucial to promote electronic

commerce, which exposes a key link between electronic commerce and the financial foundation

SUMMARY

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that improve

domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid integration

into globalization of production, and leap-frogging of available technology.  Since electronic

commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception, negotiating on

trade issues related to electronic commerce will, even more than trade negotiations have in the

past, demand self-inspection of key domestic policies, particularly in telecommunications,

financial services, and distribution and delivery.  Because these sectors are fundamental to the

workings of a modern economy, liberalization here will rebound to greater economic well-being

than comparable liberalization in more narrowly focussed sectors.  Thus, the desire to be part of

the e-commerce wave can be a powerful force to erode domestic vested interests that have slowed

the liberalization of these sectors.

Technical aspects of electronic commerce, its complexity and the characteristic of

network externalities should change the way that developing countries approach the external

negotiating process.  Specifically, the complexity of negotiations will require more cooperative

effort among countries through their regional forums (APEC, FTAA) which heretofore have

operated at the periphery of the WTO process.  Second, since electronic commerce is

characterized by network externalities, developing countries should take advantage of the

technical leadership coming out of the private sector in the most advanced countries (and their

own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft” in behind. Standing on the shoulders of giants

makes sense when network externalities and interoperable standards are key to maximizing the

benefits of e-commerce. Trying to develop domestic standards or following the old technique of

import substitution to develop a domestic industry is even more economically wasteful in the

context of the internet and electronic commerce than it was in more traditional sectors.

Trade negotiations are often the tool used to liberalize domestic sectors.  But the

complementarity between domestic policy and trade strategy is tighter in the case of e-commerce

and the internet.  Moreover, this complementarity emphasizes that e-commerce is not a service,

nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the context of the WTO commitments,

embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of electronic delivery of goods and

services as compared to delivery by another scheduled mode.  For example, insurance products

could be sold over the Internet even if the physical presence of a foreign insurance firm was not

scheduled for liberalization under GATS. Rather than view this outcome with alarm, developing

countries should embrace it as a positive force that furthers the development both of electronic

commerce, as well as encourages deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MERGES THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL
MARKETPLACES

“Electronic commerce” is a shorthand term that embraces a complex amalgam of technologies,

infrastructures, processes, and products.  It brings together whole industries and narrow

applications, producers and users, information exchange and economic activity into a global

marketplace called “the Internet.”  There is no universal definition of electronic commerce

because the Internet marketplace and its participants are so numerous and their intricate
relationships are evolving so rapidly.1  Nonetheless, one of the best ways of understanding
electronic commerce is to consider the elements of its infrastructure, its impact on the traditional

marketplace, and the continuum of ways in which electronic commerce is manifested.  This

approach shows clearly how electronic commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic

economic activity and international trade.

Electronic commerce as it has evolved today requires three types of infrastructure:

•  Technological infrastructure to create an Internet marketplace.  Electronic commerce relies
on a variety of technologies, the development of which are proceeding at breakneck speeds

(e.g., interconnectivity among telecommunications, cable, satellite, or other Internet

‘backbone;’ Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect market participants to that backbone;

and end-user devices such as PCs, TVs, or mobile telephones).

•  Process infrastructure to connect the Internet marketplace to the traditional marketplace.

This infrastructure makes payment over the Internet possible (through credit, debit, or Smart

cards, or through online currencies).  It also makes possible the distribution and delivery

(whether online or physical) of those products purchased over the Internet to the consumer.
•  “Infrastructure” of protocols, laws, and regulations.  This infrastructure affects the conduct

of those businesses engaging in and impacted by electronic commerce, as well as the

relationships between businesses, consumers, and government.  Examples include technical

communications and interconnectivity standards; the legality and modality of digital

signatures, certification, and encryption; and disclosure, privacy, and content regulations.

 

Together, these infrastructures enable electronic commerce to innovate the traditional

marketplace in three ways:
•  Process innovations: Electronic commerce simplifies, makes more efficient, reduces costs, or
otherwise alters the process by which an existing transaction takes place.  For example, Cisco

Systems replaced its phone and fax ordering process with an online ordering process and
saved more than one-half billion dollars and reduced error rates from 25 percent to 2 percent.2
Boeing used computer-aided design and electronic communication to coordinate 238 design

teams in the globalized production of the 777 aircraft, a process never before attempted in
this way, and which cut error rates by 50 percent, and reduced both costs and time to market.3
•  Product innovations:  Electronic commerce creates or facilitates new industries and products

not previously available.  For example, MP3 both enables consumers to play music

downloaded from a computer and enables musicians to upload music directly to the internet,

thereby creating a new medium to produce and consume music; WebMD repackages existing

health information in an easy-to-use online format, offers opportunities to “chat” with people

with similar health concerns, and provides “real-time” responses to health questions.

•  Market innovations: Electronic commerce also creates new markets in time, space, and in
information that heretofore did not exist because transaction and coordination costs were

prohibitively high.  For example, the online bank Wingspan offers 24-hour bill payment

features; PeopleLink is a global advertising location for artisans in remote parts of Latin

America and Africa; reverse auctions through Priceline inform businesses of the exact price a

consumer is willing to pay for the products, as well as reduce the consumer’s purchase cost.

In reviewing the infrastructures that make electronic commerce possible, as well as the

impact electronic commerce has on the traditional marketplace, we can see how electronic

commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic economic activity and international

trade.
•  The infrastructures on which e-commerce depends also are key to domestic activity.  The

three service-sector infrastructures of telecoms, financial services, and distribution and

delivery are critical components for overall economic activity.  Comprehensive liberalization

of services could raise global GDP by 4 to 6 percentage points—twice that credited to the
Uruguay Round—as well as raise the long-run global growth rate from 3.2 to 5.0 percent.4
While the transition to liberalization is  almost never without cost, liberalizing services

promises more comprehensive benefits since services are an input to production in virtually

all sectors of the economy.  In contrast, liberalization of selected goods sectors has a narrower

conduit through which it affects the overall economy.

•  Electronic commerce is global from the very start.  While traditional borders still matter in

the world of international trade, electronic commerce diminishes their importance.  No longer

do customers need to be physically present to see or hear what they are buying.  As a result,

companies on the Internet instantly become international: Amazon was selling books to

customers in over 40 countries in its first month of existence; the company now sells a variety

of products to customers in over 160 countries. The electronic marketplace is currently free

from explicit trade barriers.  The absence of international tariffs or other barriers on electronic

commerce encourages more people to try and to continue using the internet marketplace,

creating a greater level of efficiency and economic benefit for its participants.

•  Electronic commerce is integral to existing WTO commitments.  While there are currently no

explicit trade barriers on electronic commerce, the infrastructures that make electronic

commerce possible are still burdened by a myriad of trade and investment barriers.  The

growth of electronic commerce depends on continued liberalization of these infrastructures,

many of which are already part of WTO commitments.  Most important are computers and

other information technology products (covered by ITA I and under consideration for ITA II),

telecommunications (covered by the Basic Telecommunications Agreement), financial

services (addressed in the Financial Services Agreement), distribution (relevant under

TRIMS), and delivery services (under consideration for GATS 2000), among others.

Exploiting the synergies among these service sectors allows electronic commerce to flourish

and maximizes economic benefits.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS AN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY

Estimates of the growth of internet usage and electronic commerce both within domestic markets

and worldwide are notorious for their hyperbole.  Even so, each year the actual growth has

surpassed the estimate rather than falling short of it.  Respected sources such as Forrester

Research expect worldwide electronic commerce revenues to surpass $300 billion by 2002 and

accelerate to $1.3 trillion in 2003.  Currently an overwhelming (close to 85%) share of electronic

commerce is concentrated in the United States, but diffusion into Europe and Asia, followed by

Latin America and Africa will be rapid.

In developing countries internet use and its economic potential are growing

exponentially.  The share of active internet users in Asia/Pacific Rim, Latin America, and “rest of
world” could increase from 23 percent in 1999 to 35 percent in 2002.5   In India, for example, the
number of internet users nearly doubled in the last year to 270,000, and could rise to over 2
million by the end of 2000.6  E-commerce revenues could jump from $2.8 million in 1998 to
$575 million in 2002.  In China, a reported 60 percent of businesses are using the internet, and e-
commerce revenues could rise from $11.7 million in 1998 to $1.9 billion in 2002.7  In Latin
America, internet usage rose nearly eight-fold between 1995 and 1997 with revenues estimated to
be $167 million in 1998 and projected to be $8 billion by 2003.8 Africa is fully wired now that
Somalia recently added its first ISP; in South Africa, electronic commerce is expected to generate
US $1.1 billion in 1999.9

Two important facts about e-commerce are often overlooked.  First, the vast bulk of the

actual and to an even greater extent the expected growth in revenues from e-commerce comes

from business-to-business transactions.  In 1998, the ratio of B-to-B over B-to-C was 5.5 to 1; but

by 2003 the ratio is expected to be 12 to 1. Second, in virtually all countries other than the United

States, electronic commerce is export oriented.  In the US, the share of export sales in total e-

commerce revenues is only 10 percent, but in Canada it is 83 percent, in Latin America it
averages 79 percent, and in Asia/Pacific it is 38 percent.10

Moreover, the nature of the production process (comprising both manufacturing and

services) is becoming increasingly fragmented and globalized.11  Multinational firms and strategic
business alliances communicate, get price quotes, submit bids, transfer data, produce product

designs, and basically do business in an international arena.  Countries that do not have an

environment conducive to internet usage and electronic commerce will be marginalized from the

globalized production process and global economy, at increasingly great cost to their citizens.

These observations have important implications for both domestic policy and

international negotiations.  First, business to business transactions often build on existing legal

and regulatory foundations from physical trade so that issues of content, liability, and encryption

the socioeconomic challenges are difficult to surmount and will be slower to achieve, the path to

of the economy.  The efficiency of the payments system itself can help or hinder the development

of electronic commerce.  Issues of security for transactions, types of electronic media or

techniques for making transactions, as well authorization and clearing functions are key aspects

of the problem.

Electronic payments require an easy-to-use and secure payment vehicle.  Although a

number of countries are focussing on “cash on delivery” for tangible products, the future will

require a payment method that is on-line so as to accommodate products (both goods and

services) delivered digitally.  For business-to-business transactions, an easy-to-use electronic

payments mechanism is crucial to achieve the cost reductions promised by internet-based

commerce.  In addition, security for financial transactions is the sine qua non; electronic payment

must be secure and legal, with liability clearly identified, limited, and prosecuted.

Eighty percent of e-commerce transactions use credit cards, even as debit, smart cards or

digital cash are being viewed as alternatives.  Credit-card penetration by countries varies widely

and for various reasons.  In some countries, including China, the preference for cash to avoid

audit trails undermines the use of credit cards as the basis for electronic commerce transactions,

even as other forms of internet usage (such as e-mail) has risen. In other countries, such as

Taiwan, people are unwilling to use credit cards for internet transactions because there is

unlimited liability in the case of fraudulent use of the credit card number.  Finally, the additional

charge to businesses (which in some cases is transferred in full to the customer) for the use of an

internationally recognized credit card can be as high as 5 to 7 percent of the transaction (for
example in Bulgaria), much too high to be acceptable to business or consumer. 14

Beyond individual transactions, full efficiency and realization of the benefits of e-

commerce depends on rapid authorization, payments, and settlement of accounts through the

“financial plumbing” of the economy.  At minimum, authorization for transactions between

internet businesses and payment institutions (such as credit card companies or banks) needs to be

in real time, so as to allow immediate delivery of digital products.  Moreover, the shorter the time

between authorization and actual payment, the more efficient the transaction and the lower the

institutional risk.  Many developing countries do not have financial institutions or central bank

payments mechanisms that are up to this task.

When countries maintain controls on foreign exchange usage, full participation in e-

commerce for international trade is problematical.  Some countries allow exporters greater access

to international exchange than other businesses (as in Morocco, for example).  This strategy could

limit the development of electronic commerce by indigenous small businesses who need to

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS AN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY

Estimates of the growth of internet usage and electronic commerce both within domestic markets

and worldwide are notorious for their hyperbole.  Even so, each year the actual growth has

surpassed the estimate rather than falling short of it.  Respected sources such as Forrester

Research expect worldwide electronic commerce revenues to surpass $300 billion by 2002 and

accelerate to $1.3 trillion in 2003.  Currently an overwhelming (close to 85%) share of electronic

commerce is concentrated in the United States, but diffusion into Europe and Asia, followed by

Latin America and Africa will be rapid.

In developing countries internet use and its economic potential are growing

exponentially.  The share of active internet users in Asia/Pacific Rim, Latin America, and “rest of
world” could increase from 23 percent in 1999 to 35 percent in 2002.5   In India, for example, the
number of internet users nearly doubled in the last year to 270,000, and could rise to over 2
million by the end of 2000.6  E-commerce revenues could jump from $2.8 million in 1998 to
$575 million in 2002.  In China, a reported 60 percent of businesses are using the internet, and e-
commerce revenues could rise from $11.7 million in 1998 to $1.9 billion in 2002.7  In Latin
America, internet usage rose nearly eight-fold between 1995 and 1997 with revenues estimated to
be $167 million in 1998 and projected to be $8 billion by 2003.8 Africa is fully wired now that
Somalia recently added its first ISP; in South Africa, electronic commerce is expected to generate
US $1.1 billion in 1999.9

Two important facts about e-commerce are often overlooked.  First, the vast bulk of the

actual and to an even greater extent the expected growth in revenues from e-commerce comes

from business-to-business transactions.  In 1998, the ratio of B-to-B over B-to-C was 5.5 to 1; but

by 2003 the ratio is expected to be 12 to 1. Second, in virtually all countries other than the United

States, electronic commerce is export oriented.  In the US, the share of export sales in total e-

commerce revenues is only 10 percent, but in Canada it is 83 percent, in Latin America it
averages 79 percent, and in Asia/Pacific it is 38 percent.10

Moreover, the nature of the production process (comprising both manufacturing and

services) is becoming increasingly fragmented and globalized.11  Multinational firms and strategic
business alliances communicate, get price quotes, submit bids, transfer data, produce product

designs, and basically do business in an international arena.  Countries that do not have an

environment conducive to internet usage and electronic commerce will be marginalized from the

globalized production process and global economy, at increasingly great cost to their citizens.

These observations have important implications for both domestic policy and

international negotiations.  First, business to business transactions often build on existing legal

and regulatory foundations from physical trade so that issues of content, liability, and encryption

are more easily surmounted.  On the other hand, the importance of B-to-B and the desire to create

a level-playing field for all size businesses highlight the need for the international arena to offer a

transparent and codified approach to these issues.

DOMESTIC REFORMS WILL SPEED THE UPTAKE OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Developing countries need to address a number of socioeconomic and regulatory barriers before

their electronic commerce and internet use matches that of the United States or Europe.  While

the socioeconomic challenges are difficult to surmount and will be slower to achieve, the path to

reducing regulatory barriers is clearer and the benefits quicker to observe.  High Internet access

rates, low penetration of electronic means of payment (such as credit, debit, or Smart cards), and

cumbersome delivery systems are primary obstacles to the growth of electronic commerce in

developing countries.

One area that is most easily quantified and compared is internet monthly access fees.

ITU data show that these fees vary substantially across countries and that the share of the fees

accounted for by ISP charges versus accounted for by local telephone charges also varies

substantially.  For example, in the US, the approximately $20 per month internet access charge is

all an ISP charge.  In Korea, the $25 charge is about 1/3 ISP charge and 2/3 local call charges. In

Brazil, the $37 charge is nearly all a local ISP charge.  In China, the $65 charge is about half ISP
charge and about half a local phone charge.12 More importantly, when adjusted by the level of per
capita GDP, the differences in charges is tremendous.  For example, in the US and Australia fees

are about $25 per month, accounting for less than 2 percent of monthly GDP per capita.   In

contrast, in Mexico, the fee at about $27 per month accounts for about 5 percent of monthly

income and in Mozambique, that $27 per month accounts for about 70 percent of monthly GDP
per capita.13

Because the internet creates a new electronic businesses environment, “surfing” is a key

way for users to see what businesses are now doing, and what market niches remain to be

exploited.  Consequently, large “entry” and on-going costs are a great disincentive to internet

usage and therefore to the development of e-commerce business both within a country and for

international trade.  Competition, both for telephone access as well as among ISPs is a key area

where government policy can make a difference in access and uptake of the internet.

Second, a supportive electronic payments infrastructure is crucial to promote electronic

commerce, which exposes a key link between electronic commerce and the financial foundation

of the economy.  The efficiency of the payments system itself can help or hinder the development

of electronic commerce.  Issues of security for transactions, types of electronic media or

techniques for making transactions, as well authorization and clearing functions are key aspects

of the problem.

Electronic payments require an easy-to-use and secure payment vehicle.  Although a

number of countries are focussing on “cash on delivery” for tangible products, the future will

require a payment method that is on-line so as to accommodate products (both goods and

services) delivered digitally.  For business-to-business transactions, an easy-to-use electronic

payments mechanism is crucial to achieve the cost reductions promised by internet-based

commerce.  In addition, security for financial transactions is the sine qua non; electronic payment

must be secure and legal, with liability clearly identified, limited, and prosecuted.

Eighty percent of e-commerce transactions use credit cards, even as debit, smart cards or

digital cash are being viewed as alternatives.  Credit-card penetration by countries varies widely

and for various reasons.  In some countries, including China, the preference for cash to avoid

audit trails undermines the use of credit cards as the basis for electronic commerce transactions,

even as other forms of internet usage (such as e-mail) has risen. In other countries, such as

Taiwan, people are unwilling to use credit cards for internet transactions because there is

unlimited liability in the case of fraudulent use of the credit card number.  Finally, the additional

charge to businesses (which in some cases is transferred in full to the customer) for the use of an

internationally recognized credit card can be as high as 5 to 7 percent of the transaction (for
example in Bulgaria), much too high to be acceptable to business or consumer. 14

Beyond individual transactions, full efficiency and realization of the benefits of e-

commerce depends on rapid authorization, payments, and settlement of accounts through the

“financial plumbing” of the economy.  At minimum, authorization for transactions between

internet businesses and payment institutions (such as credit card companies or banks) needs to be

in real time, so as to allow immediate delivery of digital products.  Moreover, the shorter the time

between authorization and actual payment, the more efficient the transaction and the lower the

institutional risk.  Many developing countries do not have financial institutions or central bank

payments mechanisms that are up to this task.

When countries maintain controls on foreign exchange usage, full participation in e-

commerce for international trade is problematical.  Some countries allow exporters greater access

to international exchange than other businesses (as in Morocco, for example).  This strategy could

limit the development of electronic commerce by indigenous small businesses who need to

 

8

import in order to produce for a market niche in the external or even for the domestic market;

Saffron producers, for example, may achieve greater global sales by importing marketing

expertise over the internet. The desire to maintain a closed capital account but an open current

account (as in Sri Lanka for example) is more difficult when the nature of the internet

transactions is not transparent to the authorities;  who can tell whether the cross-border credit-
card payment was for a US Treasury bond rather than for a Dell computer?15

Finally, distribution and delivery systems round out the set of service infrastructures that

are key components to developing e-commerce. Speed is one of the most important

manifestations of electronic commerce.  Overnight delivery, just-in-time processing, 24 by 7

operations all are examples of how much faster and more precisely timed economic activities are

in the e-commerce world.  A country with inefficient distribution and delivery systems and

without multi-modal transport for international participation will be left behind in e-commerce.

Moreover, there is a very important link between the effectiveness of the distribution and

delivery systems and the incentives for the private sector to innovate and invest in new

technology.  Suppose the private sector spends money on internet technologies, but cannot get

products to customers because of distribution and delivery barriers, as was the case for apparel

producers in Sri Lanka attempting to break into the upscale international fashion market.  When

the economic benefits that might accrue to the private company are eroded by inefficiencies

elsewhere in the chain-to-market, it reduces the incentives for further private investment in
known technologies as well as creates a barrier to innovating new ideas for the local market. 16

How should policymakers respond to these needs for domestic reforms?  First, clear

synergies exist between the elements of policy reform.  Making substantial progress on one

element (such as telephone charges) will reap smaller rewards than expected because of the tight

relationship between the three foundations for e-commerce readiness.  Second, exploiting existing

technology available worldwide has great advantages of interoperability and can jump-start the

globalization of domestic producers.  Finally, the greatest innovation, profit, and increase in

economic well-being will be generated by private sector entrepreneurs serving market niches

unique to the home country, since only domestic entrepreneurs are truly able to understand their

own market.  Domestic policy might favor international infrastructures and overseas innovation

when network externalities and interoperability are important to create the needed foundation for

domestic initiatives.  The ones who benefit will be domestic entrepreneurs.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Issues for Domestic Policy and WTO Negotiations

Catherine L. Mann

Institute for International Economics

March 2000

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that
improve domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid
integration into globalization of production, and leap-frogging of available technology.
Electronic commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception.
Negotiating on trade issues related to electronic commerce will demand self-inspection of key
domestic policies, particularly in telecommunications, financial services, and distribution and
delivery.

Technical aspects of electronic commerce, its complexity and the characteristic of

network externalities should change the way that developing countries approach the external
negotiating process to depend more on cooperative effort through their regional forums (APEC,
FTAA).  Second, since electronic commerce is characterized by “network externalities,”
developing countries should take advantage of the technical leadership coming out of the private
sector in the most advanced countries (and their own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft”
in behind.

E-commerce is not a service, nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the

context of WTO commitments, embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of
electronic delivery of goods and services as compared to delivery by a scheduled mode. Rather
than view this outcome with alarm, developing countries should encourage it as a positive force
that furthers the development both of electronic commerce, as well as engenders deeper
liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

SUMMARY

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that improve

domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid integration

into globalization of production, and leap-frogging of available technology.  Since electronic

commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception, negotiating on

trade issues related to electronic commerce will, even more than trade negotiations have in the

past, demand self-inspection of key domestic policies, particularly in telecommunications,

financial services, and distribution and delivery.  Because these sectors are fundamental to the

workings of a modern economy, liberalization here will rebound to greater economic well-being

than comparable liberalization in more narrowly focussed sectors.  Thus, the desire to be part of

the e-commerce wave can be a powerful force to erode domestic vested interests that have slowed

the liberalization of these sectors.

Technical aspects of electronic commerce, its complexity and the characteristic of

network externalities should change the way that developing countries approach the external

negotiating process.  Specifically, the complexity of negotiations will require more cooperative

effort among countries through their regional forums (APEC, FTAA) which heretofore have

operated at the periphery of the WTO process.  Second, since electronic commerce is

characterized by network externalities, developing countries should take advantage of the

technical leadership coming out of the private sector in the most advanced countries (and their

own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft” in behind. Standing on the shoulders of giants

makes sense when network externalities and interoperable standards are key to maximizing the

benefits of e-commerce. Trying to develop domestic standards or following the old technique of

import substitution to develop a domestic industry is even more economically wasteful in the

context of the internet and electronic commerce than it was in more traditional sectors.

Trade negotiations are often the tool used to liberalize domestic sectors.  But the

complementarity between domestic policy and trade strategy is tighter in the case of e-commerce

and the internet.  Moreover, this complementarity emphasizes that e-commerce is not a service,

nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the context of the WTO commitments,

embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of electronic delivery of goods and

services as compared to delivery by another scheduled mode.  For example, insurance products

could be sold over the Internet even if the physical presence of a foreign insurance firm was not

scheduled for liberalization under GATS. Rather than view this outcome with alarm, developing

countries should embrace it as a positive force that furthers the development both of electronic

commerce, as well as encourages deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MERGES THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL
MARKETPLACES

“Electronic commerce” is a shorthand term that embraces a complex amalgam of technologies,

infrastructures, processes, and products.  It brings together whole industries and narrow

applications, producers and users, information exchange and economic activity into a global

marketplace called “the Internet.”  There is no universal definition of electronic commerce

because the Internet marketplace and its participants are so numerous and their intricate
relationships are evolving so rapidly.1  Nonetheless, one of the best ways of understanding
electronic commerce is to consider the elements of its infrastructure, its impact on the traditional

marketplace, and the continuum of ways in which electronic commerce is manifested.  This

approach shows clearly how electronic commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic

economic activity and international trade.

Electronic commerce as it has evolved today requires three types of infrastructure:

•  Technological infrastructure to create an Internet marketplace.  Electronic commerce relies
on a variety of technologies, the development of which are proceeding at breakneck speeds

(e.g., interconnectivity among telecommunications, cable, satellite, or other Internet

‘backbone;’ Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect market participants to that backbone;

and end-user devices such as PCs, TVs, or mobile telephones).

•  Process infrastructure to connect the Internet marketplace to the traditional marketplace.

This infrastructure makes payment over the Internet possible (through credit, debit, or Smart

cards, or through online currencies).  It also makes possible the distribution and delivery

(whether online or physical) of those products purchased over the Internet to the consumer.
•  “Infrastructure” of protocols, laws, and regulations.  This infrastructure affects the conduct

of those businesses engaging in and impacted by electronic commerce, as well as the

relationships between businesses, consumers, and government.  Examples include technical

communications and interconnectivity standards; the legality and modality of digital

signatures, certification, and encryption; and disclosure, privacy, and content regulations.

 

Together, these infrastructures enable electronic commerce to innovate the traditional

marketplace in three ways:
•  Process innovations: Electronic commerce simplifies, makes more efficient, reduces costs, or
otherwise alters the process by which an existing transaction takes place.  For example, Cisco

Systems replaced its phone and fax ordering process with an online ordering process and
saved more than one-half billion dollars and reduced error rates from 25 percent to 2 percent.2
Boeing used computer-aided design and electronic communication to coordinate 238 design

teams in the globalized production of the 777 aircraft, a process never before attempted in
this way, and which cut error rates by 50 percent, and reduced both costs and time to market.3
•  Product innovations:  Electronic commerce creates or facilitates new industries and products

not previously available.  For example, MP3 both enables consumers to play music

downloaded from a computer and enables musicians to upload music directly to the internet,

thereby creating a new medium to produce and consume music; WebMD repackages existing

health information in an easy-to-use online format, offers opportunities to “chat” with people

with similar health concerns, and provides “real-time” responses to health questions.

•  Market innovations: Electronic commerce also creates new markets in time, space, and in
information that heretofore did not exist because transaction and coordination costs were

prohibitively high.  For example, the online bank Wingspan offers 24-hour bill payment

features; PeopleLink is a global advertising location for artisans in remote parts of Latin

America and Africa; reverse auctions through Priceline inform businesses of the exact price a

consumer is willing to pay for the products, as well as reduce the consumer’s purchase cost.

In reviewing the infrastructures that make electronic commerce possible, as well as the

impact electronic commerce has on the traditional marketplace, we can see how electronic

commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic economic activity and international

trade.
•  The infrastructures on which e-commerce depends also are key to domestic activity.  The

three service-sector infrastructures of telecoms, financial services, and distribution and

delivery are critical components for overall economic activity.  Comprehensive liberalization

of services could raise global GDP by 4 to 6 percentage points—twice that credited to the
Uruguay Round—as well as raise the long-run global growth rate from 3.2 to 5.0 percent.4
While the transition to liberalization is  almost never without cost, liberalizing services

promises more comprehensive benefits since services are an input to production in virtually

all sectors of the economy.  In contrast, liberalization of selected goods sectors has a narrower

conduit through which it affects the overall economy.

substantially.  For example, in the US, the approximately $20 per month internet access charge is

all an ISP charge.  In Korea, the $25 charge is about 1/3 ISP charge and 2/3 local call charges. In

Brazil, the $37 charge is nearly all a local ISP charge.  In China, the $65 charge is about half ISP
charge and about half a local phone charge.12 More importantly, when adjusted by the level of per
capita GDP, the differences in charges is tremendous.  For example, in the US and Australia fees

are about $25 per month, accounting for less than 2 percent of monthly GDP per capita.   In

contrast, in Mexico, the fee at about $27 per month accounts for about 5 percent of monthly

income and in Mozambique, that $27 per month accounts for about 70 percent of monthly GDP
per capita.13

Because the internet creates a new electronic businesses environment, “surfing” is a key

way for users to see what businesses are now doing, and what market niches remain to be

exploited.  Consequently, large “entry” and on-going costs are a great disincentive to internet

usage and therefore to the development of e-commerce business both within a country and for

international trade.  Competition, both for telephone access as well as among ISPs is a key area

where government policy can make a difference in access and uptake of the internet.

Second, a supportive electronic payments infrastructure is crucial to promote electronic

commerce, which exposes a key link between electronic commerce and the financial foundation

of the economy.  The efficiency of the payments system itself can help or hinder the development

of electronic commerce.  Issues of security for transactions, types of electronic media or

techniques for making transactions, as well authorization and clearing functions are key aspects

of the problem.

Electronic payments require an easy-to-use and secure payment vehicle.  Although a

number of countries are focussing on “cash on delivery” for tangible products, the future will

require a payment method that is on-line so as to accommodate products (both goods and

services) delivered digitally.  For business-to-business transactions, an easy-to-use electronic

payments mechanism is crucial to achieve the cost reductions promised by internet-based

commerce.  In addition, security for financial transactions is the sine qua non; electronic payment

must be secure and legal, with liability clearly identified, limited, and prosecuted.

Eighty percent of e-commerce transactions use credit cards, even as debit, smart cards or

digital cash are being viewed as alternatives.  Credit-card penetration by countries varies widely

and for various reasons.  In some countries, including China, the preference for cash to avoid

audit trails undermines the use of credit cards as the basis for electronic commerce transactions,

even as other forms of internet usage (such as e-mail) has risen. In other countries, such as

Taiwan, people are unwilling to use credit cards for internet transactions because there is

unlimited liability in the case of fraudulent use of the credit card number.  Finally, the additional

charge to businesses (which in some cases is transferred in full to the customer) for the use of an

internationally recognized credit card can be as high as 5 to 7 percent of the transaction (for
example in Bulgaria), much too high to be acceptable to business or consumer. 14

Beyond individual transactions, full efficiency and realization of the benefits of e-

commerce depends on rapid authorization, payments, and settlement of accounts through the

“financial plumbing” of the economy.  At minimum, authorization for transactions between

internet businesses and payment institutions (such as credit card companies or banks) needs to be

in real time, so as to allow immediate delivery of digital products.  Moreover, the shorter the time

between authorization and actual payment, the more efficient the transaction and the lower the

institutional risk.  Many developing countries do not have financial institutions or central bank

payments mechanisms that are up to this task.

When countries maintain controls on foreign exchange usage, full participation in e-

commerce for international trade is problematical.  Some countries allow exporters greater access

to international exchange than other businesses (as in Morocco, for example).  This strategy could

limit the development of electronic commerce by indigenous small businesses who need to

 

8

import in order to produce for a market niche in the external or even for the domestic market;

Saffron producers, for example, may achieve greater global sales by importing marketing

expertise over the internet. The desire to maintain a closed capital account but an open current

account (as in Sri Lanka for example) is more difficult when the nature of the internet

transactions is not transparent to the authorities;  who can tell whether the cross-border credit-
card payment was for a US Treasury bond rather than for a Dell computer?15

Finally, distribution and delivery systems round out the set of service infrastructures that

are key components to developing e-commerce. Speed is one of the most important

manifestations of electronic commerce.  Overnight delivery, just-in-time processing, 24 by 7

operations all are examples of how much faster and more precisely timed economic activities are

in the e-commerce world.  A country with inefficient distribution and delivery systems and

without multi-modal transport for international participation will be left behind in e-commerce.

Moreover, there is a very important link between the effectiveness of the distribution and

delivery systems and the incentives for the private sector to innovate and invest in new

technology.  Suppose the private sector spends money on internet technologies, but cannot get

products to customers because of distribution and delivery barriers, as was the case for apparel

producers in Sri Lanka attempting to break into the upscale international fashion market.  When

the economic benefits that might accrue to the private company are eroded by inefficiencies

elsewhere in the chain-to-market, it reduces the incentives for further private investment in
known technologies as well as creates a barrier to innovating new ideas for the local market. 16

How should policymakers respond to these needs for domestic reforms?  First, clear

synergies exist between the elements of policy reform.  Making substantial progress on one

element (such as telephone charges) will reap smaller rewards than expected because of the tight

relationship between the three foundations for e-commerce readiness.  Second, exploiting existing

technology available worldwide has great advantages of interoperability and can jump-start the

globalization of domestic producers.  Finally, the greatest innovation, profit, and increase in

economic well-being will be generated by private sector entrepreneurs serving market niches

unique to the home country, since only domestic entrepreneurs are truly able to understand their

own market.  Domestic policy might favor international infrastructures and overseas innovation

when network externalities and interoperability are important to create the needed foundation for

domestic initiatives.  The ones who benefit will be domestic entrepreneurs.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS IN THE WTO

The WTO has done a substantial amount of work with regard to electronic commerce, but the

cross-cutting and rapidly evolving environment of electronic commerce poses a true challenge

both to the organizing structure of the WTO (GATT and GATS, and role of subcommittees), as

well as to the operational method of its members (request-offer negotiations and negative vs.
positive commitments). 17  One the other hand, traditional WTO principles of non-discrimination,
transparency, neutrality, and market openness remain valid and should be applied to electronic

commerce.  New rules are not necessary if liberalizing commitments embodied in GATT, GATS,

TRIPs, and other WTO agreements are honored.

Probably the key issue is whether electronic commerce and digitized products should be

classified into GATT, GATS, both, or neither.  The European Union strongly asserts that “all

electronic transmissions consist of services;” and, therefore, these products should fall under the
purview of GATS.18  Most countries, including the US, agree that services delivered over the
internet are covered by GATS, but other products are more like a good or are a hybrid between a

good and a service (electronic books are a popular example).  Thus the US is arguing that more

time is needed to monitor the development of electronic commerce before any final classification

takes place. A key point is that classifying these products under GATS could make their treatment

under the WTO less liberal, because market access in GATS exists only in sectors where

members have made specific commitments (software downloaded from the Internet, for example,

is not covered by GATS).  Moreover, whether existing commitments include electronic
transmissions as a mode of delivery is itself under contention. 19

A compromise that would yield the greatest liberalization sidesteps the classification

issue and requires that WTO members follow the course of most liberal treatment of these

products, either under GATT or GATS, particularly when a specific product does not fit neatly

within a negotiated service sector commitment. In some cases, this could mean that electronic

delivery of goods and services would be treated more favorably than other forms of delivery.  For

example, financial products or architectural services could be sold over the internet even as the

physical presence of a foreign bank or licensing of foreign architects had not yet been scheduled

for liberalization under GATS.  This liberalization bias engendered by electronic commerce can

SUMMARY

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that improve

domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid integration

into globalization of production, and leap-frogging of available technology.  Since electronic

commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception, negotiating on

trade issues related to electronic commerce will, even more than trade negotiations have in the

past, demand self-inspection of key domestic policies, particularly in telecommunications,

financial services, and distribution and delivery.  Because these sectors are fundamental to the

workings of a modern economy, liberalization here will rebound to greater economic well-being

than comparable liberalization in more narrowly focussed sectors.  Thus, the desire to be part of

the e-commerce wave can be a powerful force to erode domestic vested interests that have slowed

the liberalization of these sectors.

Technical aspects of electronic commerce, its complexity and the characteristic of

network externalities should change the way that developing countries approach the external

negotiating process.  Specifically, the complexity of negotiations will require more cooperative

effort among countries through their regional forums (APEC, FTAA) which heretofore have

operated at the periphery of the WTO process.  Second, since electronic commerce is

characterized by network externalities, developing countries should take advantage of the

technical leadership coming out of the private sector in the most advanced countries (and their

own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft” in behind. Standing on the shoulders of giants

makes sense when network externalities and interoperable standards are key to maximizing the

benefits of e-commerce. Trying to develop domestic standards or following the old technique of

import substitution to develop a domestic industry is even more economically wasteful in the

context of the internet and electronic commerce than it was in more traditional sectors.

Trade negotiations are often the tool used to liberalize domestic sectors.  But the

complementarity between domestic policy and trade strategy is tighter in the case of e-commerce

and the internet.  Moreover, this complementarity emphasizes that e-commerce is not a service,

nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the context of the WTO commitments,

embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of electronic delivery of goods and

services as compared to delivery by another scheduled mode.  For example, insurance products

could be sold over the Internet even if the physical presence of a foreign insurance firm was not

scheduled for liberalization under GATS. Rather than view this outcome with alarm, developing

countries should embrace it as a positive force that furthers the development both of electronic

commerce, as well as encourages deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MERGES THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL
MARKETPLACES

“Electronic commerce” is a shorthand term that embraces a complex amalgam of technologies,

infrastructures, processes, and products.  It brings together whole industries and narrow

applications, producers and users, information exchange and economic activity into a global

marketplace called “the Internet.”  There is no universal definition of electronic commerce

because the Internet marketplace and its participants are so numerous and their intricate
relationships are evolving so rapidly.1  Nonetheless, one of the best ways of understanding
electronic commerce is to consider the elements of its infrastructure, its impact on the traditional

marketplace, and the continuum of ways in which electronic commerce is manifested.  This

approach shows clearly how electronic commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic

economic activity and international trade.

Electronic commerce as it has evolved today requires three types of infrastructure:

•  Technological infrastructure to create an Internet marketplace.  Electronic commerce relies
on a variety of technologies, the development of which are proceeding at breakneck speeds

(e.g., interconnectivity among telecommunications, cable, satellite, or other Internet

‘backbone;’ Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect market participants to that backbone;

and end-user devices such as PCs, TVs, or mobile telephones).

•  Process infrastructure to connect the Internet marketplace to the traditional marketplace.

This infrastructure makes payment over the Internet possible (through credit, debit, or Smart

cards, or through online currencies).  It also makes possible the distribution and delivery

(whether online or physical) of those products purchased over the Internet to the consumer.
•  “Infrastructure” of protocols, laws, and regulations.  This infrastructure affects the conduct

of those businesses engaging in and impacted by electronic commerce, as well as the

relationships between businesses, consumers, and government.  Examples include technical

communications and interconnectivity standards; the legality and modality of digital

signatures, certification, and encryption; and disclosure, privacy, and content regulations.

 

Together, these infrastructures enable electronic commerce to innovate the traditional

marketplace in three ways:
•  Process innovations: Electronic commerce simplifies, makes more efficient, reduces costs, or
otherwise alters the process by which an existing transaction takes place.  For example, Cisco

Systems replaced its phone and fax ordering process with an online ordering process and
saved more than one-half billion dollars and reduced error rates from 25 percent to 2 percent.2
Boeing used computer-aided design and electronic communication to coordinate 238 design

teams in the globalized production of the 777 aircraft, a process never before attempted in
this way, and which cut error rates by 50 percent, and reduced both costs and time to market.3
•  Product innovations:  Electronic commerce creates or facilitates new industries and products

not previously available.  For example, MP3 both enables consumers to play music

downloaded from a computer and enables musicians to upload music directly to the internet,

thereby creating a new medium to produce and consume music; WebMD repackages existing

health information in an easy-to-use online format, offers opportunities to “chat” with people

with similar health concerns, and provides “real-time” responses to health questions.

•  Market innovations: Electronic commerce also creates new markets in time, space, and in
information that heretofore did not exist because transaction and coordination costs were

prohibitively high.  For example, the online bank Wingspan offers 24-hour bill payment

features; PeopleLink is a global advertising location for artisans in remote parts of Latin

America and Africa; reverse auctions through Priceline inform businesses of the exact price a

consumer is willing to pay for the products, as well as reduce the consumer’s purchase cost.

In reviewing the infrastructures that make electronic commerce possible, as well as the

impact electronic commerce has on the traditional marketplace, we can see how electronic

commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic economic activity and international

trade.
•  The infrastructures on which e-commerce depends also are key to domestic activity.  The

three service-sector infrastructures of telecoms, financial services, and distribution and

delivery are critical components for overall economic activity.  Comprehensive liberalization

of services could raise global GDP by 4 to 6 percentage points—twice that credited to the
Uruguay Round—as well as raise the long-run global growth rate from 3.2 to 5.0 percent.4
While the transition to liberalization is  almost never without cost, liberalizing services

promises more comprehensive benefits since services are an input to production in virtually

all sectors of the economy.  In contrast, liberalization of selected goods sectors has a narrower

conduit through which it affects the overall economy.

•  Electronic commerce is global from the very start.  While traditional borders still matter in

the world of international trade, electronic commerce diminishes their importance.  No longer

do customers need to be physically present to see or hear what they are buying.  As a result,

companies on the Internet instantly become international: Amazon was selling books to

customers in over 40 countries in its first month of existence; the company now sells a variety

of products to customers in over 160 countries. The electronic marketplace is currently free

from explicit trade barriers.  The absence of international tariffs or other barriers on electronic

commerce encourages more people to try and to continue using the internet marketplace,

creating a greater level of efficiency and economic benefit for its participants.

•  Electronic commerce is integral to existing WTO commitments.  While there are currently no

explicit trade barriers on electronic commerce, the infrastructures that make electronic

commerce possible are still burdened by a myriad of trade and investment barriers.  The

growth of electronic commerce depends on continued liberalization of these infrastructures,

many of which are already part of WTO commitments.  Most important are computers and

other information technology products (covered by ITA I and under consideration for ITA II),

telecommunications (covered by the Basic Telecommunications Agreement), financial

services (addressed in the Financial Services Agreement), distribution (relevant under

TRIMS), and delivery services (under consideration for GATS 2000), among others.

Exploiting the synergies among these service sectors allows electronic commerce to flourish

and maximizes economic benefits.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS AN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY

Estimates of the growth of internet usage and electronic commerce both within domestic markets

and worldwide are notorious for their hyperbole.  Even so, each year the actual growth has

surpassed the estimate rather than falling short of it.  Respected sources such as Forrester

Research expect worldwide electronic commerce revenues to surpass $300 billion by 2002 and

accelerate to $1.3 trillion in 2003.  Currently an overwhelming (close to 85%) share of electronic

commerce is concentrated in the United States, but diffusion into Europe and Asia, followed by

Latin America and Africa will be rapid.

In developing countries internet use and its economic potential are growing

exponentially.  The share of active internet users in Asia/Pacific Rim, Latin America, and “rest of
world” could increase from 23 percent in 1999 to 35 percent in 2002.5   In India, for example, the
number of internet users nearly doubled in the last year to 270,000, and could rise to over 2
million by the end of 2000.6  E-commerce revenues could jump from $2.8 million in 1998 to
$575 million in 2002.  In China, a reported 60 percent of businesses are using the internet, and e-
commerce revenues could rise from $11.7 million in 1998 to $1.9 billion in 2002.7  In Latin
America, internet usage rose nearly eight-fold between 1995 and 1997 with revenues estimated to
be $167 million in 1998 and projected to be $8 billion by 2003.8 Africa is fully wired now that
Somalia recently added its first ISP; in South Africa, electronic commerce is expected to generate
US $1.1 billion in 1999.9

Two important facts about e-commerce are often overlooked.  First, the vast bulk of the

actual and to an even greater extent the expected growth in revenues from e-commerce comes

from business-to-business transactions.  In 1998, the ratio of B-to-B over B-to-C was 5.5 to 1; but

by 2003 the ratio is expected to be 12 to 1. Second, in virtually all countries other than the United

States, electronic commerce is export oriented.  In the US, the share of export sales in total e-

commerce revenues is only 10 percent, but in Canada it is 83 percent, in Latin America it
averages 79 percent, and in Asia/Pacific it is 38 percent.10

Moreover, the nature of the production process (comprising both manufacturing and

services) is becoming increasingly fragmented and globalized.11  Multinational firms and strategic
business alliances communicate, get price quotes, submit bids, transfer data, produce product

designs, and basically do business in an international arena.  Countries that do not have an

environment conducive to internet usage and electronic commerce will be marginalized from the

globalized production process and global economy, at increasingly great cost to their citizens.

These observations have important implications for both domestic policy and

international negotiations.  First, business to business transactions often build on existing legal

and regulatory foundations from physical trade so that issues of content, liability, and encryption

are more easily surmounted.  On the other hand, the importance of B-to-B and the desire to create

a level-playing field for all size businesses highlight the need for the international arena to offer a

transparent and codified approach to these issues.

DOMESTIC REFORMS WILL SPEED THE UPTAKE OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Developing countries need to address a number of socioeconomic and regulatory barriers before

their electronic commerce and internet use matches that of the United States or Europe.  While

the socioeconomic challenges are difficult to surmount and will be slower to achieve, the path to

reducing regulatory barriers is clearer and the benefits quicker to observe.  High Internet access

rates, low penetration of electronic means of payment (such as credit, debit, or Smart cards), and

cumbersome delivery systems are primary obstacles to the growth of electronic commerce in

developing countries.

One area that is most easily quantified and compared is internet monthly access fees.

ITU data show that these fees vary substantially across countries and that the share of the fees

accounted for by ISP charges versus accounted for by local telephone charges also varies

substantially.  For example, in the US, the approximately $20 per month internet access charge is

all an ISP charge.  In Korea, the $25 charge is about 1/3 ISP charge and 2/3 local call charges. In

Brazil, the $37 charge is nearly all a local ISP charge.  In China, the $65 charge is about half ISP
charge and about half a local phone charge.12 More importantly, when adjusted by the level of per
capita GDP, the differences in charges is tremendous.  For example, in the US and Australia fees

are about $25 per month, accounting for less than 2 percent of monthly GDP per capita.   In

contrast, in Mexico, the fee at about $27 per month accounts for about 5 percent of monthly

income and in Mozambique, that $27 per month accounts for about 70 percent of monthly GDP
per capita.13

Because the internet creates a new electronic businesses environment, “surfing” is a key

way for users to see what businesses are now doing, and what market niches remain to be

exploited.  Consequently, large “entry” and on-going costs are a great disincentive to internet

usage and therefore to the development of e-commerce business both within a country and for

international trade.  Competition, both for telephone access as well as among ISPs is a key area

where government policy can make a difference in access and uptake of the internet.

Second, a supportive electronic payments infrastructure is crucial to promote electronic

commerce, which exposes a key link between electronic commerce and the financial foundation

of the economy.  The efficiency of the payments system itself can help or hinder the development

of electronic commerce.  Issues of security for transactions, types of electronic media or

techniques for making transactions, as well authorization and clearing functions are key aspects

of the problem.

Electronic payments require an easy-to-use and secure payment vehicle.  Although a

number of countries are focussing on “cash on delivery” for tangible products, the future will

require a payment method that is on-line so as to accommodate products (both goods and

services) delivered digitally.  For business-to-business transactions, an easy-to-use electronic

payments mechanism is crucial to achieve the cost reductions promised by internet-based

commerce.  In addition, security for financial transactions is the sine qua non; electronic payment

must be secure and legal, with liability clearly identified, limited, and prosecuted.

Eighty percent of e-commerce transactions use credit cards, even as debit, smart cards or

digital cash are being viewed as alternatives.  Credit-card penetration by countries varies widely

and for various reasons.  In some countries, including China, the preference for cash to avoid

audit trails undermines the use of credit cards as the basis for electronic commerce transactions,

even as other forms of internet usage (such as e-mail) has risen. In other countries, such as

Taiwan, people are unwilling to use credit cards for internet transactions because there is

unlimited liability in the case of fraudulent use of the credit card number.  Finally, the additional

charge to businesses (which in some cases is transferred in full to the customer) for the use of an

internationally recognized credit card can be as high as 5 to 7 percent of the transaction (for
example in Bulgaria), much too high to be acceptable to business or consumer. 14

Beyond individual transactions, full efficiency and realization of the benefits of e-

commerce depends on rapid authorization, payments, and settlement of accounts through the

“financial plumbing” of the economy.  At minimum, authorization for transactions between

internet businesses and payment institutions (such as credit card companies or banks) needs to be

in real time, so as to allow immediate delivery of digital products.  Moreover, the shorter the time

between authorization and actual payment, the more efficient the transaction and the lower the

institutional risk.  Many developing countries do not have financial institutions or central bank

payments mechanisms that are up to this task.

When countries maintain controls on foreign exchange usage, full participation in e-

commerce for international trade is problematical.  Some countries allow exporters greater access

to international exchange than other businesses (as in Morocco, for example).  This strategy could

limit the development of electronic commerce by indigenous small businesses who need to

 

8

import in order to produce for a market niche in the external or even for the domestic market;

Saffron producers, for example, may achieve greater global sales by importing marketing

expertise over the internet. The desire to maintain a closed capital account but an open current

account (as in Sri Lanka for example) is more difficult when the nature of the internet

transactions is not transparent to the authorities;  who can tell whether the cross-border credit-
card payment was for a US Treasury bond rather than for a Dell computer?15

Finally, distribution and delivery systems round out the set of service infrastructures that

are key components to developing e-commerce. Speed is one of the most important

manifestations of electronic commerce.  Overnight delivery, just-in-time processing, 24 by 7

operations all are examples of how much faster and more precisely timed economic activities are

in the e-commerce world.  A country with inefficient distribution and delivery systems and

without multi-modal transport for international participation will be left behind in e-commerce.

Moreover, there is a very important link between the effectiveness of the distribution and

delivery systems and the incentives for the private sector to innovate and invest in new

technology.  Suppose the private sector spends money on internet technologies, but cannot get

products to customers because of distribution and delivery barriers, as was the case for apparel

producers in Sri Lanka attempting to break into the upscale international fashion market.  When

the economic benefits that might accrue to the private company are eroded by inefficiencies

elsewhere in the chain-to-market, it reduces the incentives for further private investment in
known technologies as well as creates a barrier to innovating new ideas for the local market. 16

How should policymakers respond to these needs for domestic reforms?  First, clear

synergies exist between the elements of policy reform.  Making substantial progress on one

element (such as telephone charges) will reap smaller rewards than expected because of the tight

relationship between the three foundations for e-commerce readiness.  Second, exploiting existing

technology available worldwide has great advantages of interoperability and can jump-start the

globalization of domestic producers.  Finally, the greatest innovation, profit, and increase in

economic well-being will be generated by private sector entrepreneurs serving market niches

unique to the home country, since only domestic entrepreneurs are truly able to understand their

own market.  Domestic policy might favor international infrastructures and overseas innovation

when network externalities and interoperability are important to create the needed foundation for

domestic initiatives.  The ones who benefit will be domestic entrepreneurs.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS IN THE WTO

The WTO has done a substantial amount of work with regard to electronic commerce, but the

cross-cutting and rapidly evolving environment of electronic commerce poses a true challenge

both to the organizing structure of the WTO (GATT and GATS, and role of subcommittees), as

well as to the operational method of its members (request-offer negotiations and negative vs.
positive commitments). 17  One the other hand, traditional WTO principles of non-discrimination,
transparency, neutrality, and market openness remain valid and should be applied to electronic

commerce.  New rules are not necessary if liberalizing commitments embodied in GATT, GATS,

TRIPs, and other WTO agreements are honored.

Probably the key issue is whether electronic commerce and digitized products should be

classified into GATT, GATS, both, or neither.  The European Union strongly asserts that “all

electronic transmissions consist of services;” and, therefore, these products should fall under the
purview of GATS.18  Most countries, including the US, agree that services delivered over the
internet are covered by GATS, but other products are more like a good or are a hybrid between a

good and a service (electronic books are a popular example).  Thus the US is arguing that more

time is needed to monitor the development of electronic commerce before any final classification

takes place. A key point is that classifying these products under GATS could make their treatment

under the WTO less liberal, because market access in GATS exists only in sectors where

members have made specific commitments (software downloaded from the Internet, for example,

is not covered by GATS).  Moreover, whether existing commitments include electronic
transmissions as a mode of delivery is itself under contention. 19

A compromise that would yield the greatest liberalization sidesteps the classification

issue and requires that WTO members follow the course of most liberal treatment of these

products, either under GATT or GATS, particularly when a specific product does not fit neatly

within a negotiated service sector commitment. In some cases, this could mean that electronic

delivery of goods and services would be treated more favorably than other forms of delivery.  For

example, financial products or architectural services could be sold over the internet even as the

physical presence of a foreign bank or licensing of foreign architects had not yet been scheduled

for liberalization under GATS.  This liberalization bias engendered by electronic commerce can

conference volume edited by Jeffrey Schott and published by the Institute for International Economics.

act as a positive force, stimulating further the development of electronic commerce, as well as
encouraging deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.20

Governments do have a legitimate concern that their standards and regulations (e.g.,

pharmaceutical prescriptions, gambling restrictions, and the prudential regulation of banks) might

be undermined by the more favorable treatment afforded by electronic commerce.  Now is a good

time for governments to review how electronic commerce puts stress on existing standards and

regulations, and to decide what combination of private sector response and public legislation will

ensure the greatest benefits of electronic commerce for their citizens.

Moreover, societies do differ in their preferences toward certain aspects of privacy and

levels of security (among other things), and governments are elected to represent those views.

Diversity in the level of government intervention into some areas of governance of the electronic

commerce environment could be appropriate, and appears to be inevitable in any case.

Given the global nature of electronic commerce, governments should try to coordinate

(which need not mean harmonize) new regulations with other countries on a bilateral and

multilateral basis.  What does this mean?  An example in the area of privacy regulation illustrates

the idea. As background and in simple terms, the US approach to privacy is to let the private

sector offer different levels of privacy, whereas the European Union Privacy Directive mandates a
particular level of privacy.21 Do these different approaches become a barrier to cross-border trade,
or can a “trusted third party”, a private firm, bridge these two approaches to privacy?  Such a firm

would investigate the privacy policies and methods of the US firm and guarantee that it was

abiding by the EU Directive; the EU would give the firm its seal of approval that its methods met
the standards of the EU. 22 This represents a market-oriented solution to the need to arbitrage
across the desire for firms to trade data across borders and the desire by societies (or at least

governments) to have different approaches to privacy.

 A second issue relevant for developing countries and the WTO is negotiating method.

This issue grows out of the synergies between the elements of e-commerce readiness.  Because of

these synergies, country delegations will begin emphasizing the “horizontal’’ approach to

negotiations on electronic commerce.  The initial US proposal on services in mid-summer 1999

                                                
20 William Drake and Kalypso Nicolaides in  their “The Information Revolution and Services Trade
Liberalization After 2000”, manuscript for WSC conference “Services 2000: New Directions in Services
Trade Liberalization, June 1999, argue that this approach in effect changes the outcome of the negotiations
agreed to in the Uruguay Round.  As negotiators, they are correct.  However, from the standpoint of
economic well-being, the liberalizing bias is to be welcomed, not voided.
21 The privacy issue is quite complex and evolving and cannot be fully developed here.  See Peter Swire
and Robert Litan, None of Your Business,  Brookings Institution, 1998

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Issues for Domestic Policy and WTO Negotiations

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that
improve domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid

Electronic commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception.
Negotiating on trade issues related to electronic commerce will demand self-inspection of key

developing countries should take advantage of the technical leadership coming out of the private
sector in the most advanced countries (and their own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft”

E-commerce is not a service, nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the

context of WTO commitments, embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of
electronic delivery of goods and services as compared to delivery by a scheduled mode. Rather
than view this outcome with alarm, developing countries should encourage it as a positive force
that furthers the development both of electronic commerce, as well as engenders deeper
liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

SUMMARY

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that improve

domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid integration

into globalization of production, and leap-frogging of available technology.  Since electronic

commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception, negotiating on

trade issues related to electronic commerce will, even more than trade negotiations have in the

past, demand self-inspection of key domestic policies, particularly in telecommunications,

financial services, and distribution and delivery.  Because these sectors are fundamental to the

workings of a modern economy, liberalization here will rebound to greater economic well-being

than comparable liberalization in more narrowly focussed sectors.  Thus, the desire to be part of

the e-commerce wave can be a powerful force to erode domestic vested interests that have slowed

the liberalization of these sectors.

Technical aspects of electronic commerce, its complexity and the characteristic of

network externalities should change the way that developing countries approach the external

negotiating process.  Specifically, the complexity of negotiations will require more cooperative

effort among countries through their regional forums (APEC, FTAA) which heretofore have

operated at the periphery of the WTO process.  Second, since electronic commerce is

characterized by network externalities, developing countries should take advantage of the

technical leadership coming out of the private sector in the most advanced countries (and their

own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft” in behind. Standing on the shoulders of giants

makes sense when network externalities and interoperable standards are key to maximizing the

benefits of e-commerce. Trying to develop domestic standards or following the old technique of

import substitution to develop a domestic industry is even more economically wasteful in the

context of the internet and electronic commerce than it was in more traditional sectors.

Trade negotiations are often the tool used to liberalize domestic sectors.  But the

complementarity between domestic policy and trade strategy is tighter in the case of e-commerce

and the internet.  Moreover, this complementarity emphasizes that e-commerce is not a service,

nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the context of the WTO commitments,

embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of electronic delivery of goods and

services as compared to delivery by another scheduled mode.  For example, insurance products

could be sold over the Internet even if the physical presence of a foreign insurance firm was not

scheduled for liberalization under GATS. Rather than view this outcome with alarm, developing

countries should embrace it as a positive force that furthers the development both of electronic

commerce, as well as encourages deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MERGES THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL
MARKETPLACES

“Electronic commerce” is a shorthand term that embraces a complex amalgam of technologies,

infrastructures, processes, and products.  It brings together whole industries and narrow

applications, producers and users, information exchange and economic activity into a global

marketplace called “the Internet.”  There is no universal definition of electronic commerce

because the Internet marketplace and its participants are so numerous and their intricate
relationships are evolving so rapidly.1  Nonetheless, one of the best ways of understanding
electronic commerce is to consider the elements of its infrastructure, its impact on the traditional

marketplace, and the continuum of ways in which electronic commerce is manifested.  This

approach shows clearly how electronic commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic

economic activity and international trade.

Electronic commerce as it has evolved today requires three types of infrastructure:

•  Technological infrastructure to create an Internet marketplace.  Electronic commerce relies
on a variety of technologies, the development of which are proceeding at breakneck speeds

(e.g., interconnectivity among telecommunications, cable, satellite, or other Internet

‘backbone;’ Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect market participants to that backbone;

and end-user devices such as PCs, TVs, or mobile telephones).

•  Process infrastructure to connect the Internet marketplace to the traditional marketplace.

This infrastructure makes payment over the Internet possible (through credit, debit, or Smart

cards, or through online currencies).  It also makes possible the distribution and delivery

(whether online or physical) of those products purchased over the Internet to the consumer.
•  “Infrastructure” of protocols, laws, and regulations.  This infrastructure affects the conduct

of those businesses engaging in and impacted by electronic commerce, as well as the

relationships between businesses, consumers, and government.  Examples include technical

communications and interconnectivity standards; the legality and modality of digital

signatures, certification, and encryption; and disclosure, privacy, and content regulations.

 

Together, these infrastructures enable electronic commerce to innovate the traditional

marketplace in three ways:
•  Process innovations: Electronic commerce simplifies, makes more efficient, reduces costs, or
otherwise alters the process by which an existing transaction takes place.  For example, Cisco

Systems replaced its phone and fax ordering process with an online ordering process and
saved more than one-half billion dollars and reduced error rates from 25 percent to 2 percent.2
Boeing used computer-aided design and electronic communication to coordinate 238 design

teams in the globalized production of the 777 aircraft, a process never before attempted in
this way, and which cut error rates by 50 percent, and reduced both costs and time to market.3
•  Product innovations:  Electronic commerce creates or facilitates new industries and products

not previously available.  For example, MP3 both enables consumers to play music

downloaded from a computer and enables musicians to upload music directly to the internet,

thereby creating a new medium to produce and consume music; WebMD repackages existing

health information in an easy-to-use online format, offers opportunities to “chat” with people

with similar health concerns, and provides “real-time” responses to health questions.

•  Market innovations: Electronic commerce also creates new markets in time, space, and in
information that heretofore did not exist because transaction and coordination costs were

prohibitively high.  For example, the online bank Wingspan offers 24-hour bill payment

features; PeopleLink is a global advertising location for artisans in remote parts of Latin

America and Africa; reverse auctions through Priceline inform businesses of the exact price a

consumer is willing to pay for the products, as well as reduce the consumer’s purchase cost.

In reviewing the infrastructures that make electronic commerce possible, as well as the

impact electronic commerce has on the traditional marketplace, we can see how electronic

commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic economic activity and international

trade.
•  The infrastructures on which e-commerce depends also are key to domestic activity.  The

three service-sector infrastructures of telecoms, financial services, and distribution and

delivery are critical components for overall economic activity.  Comprehensive liberalization

of services could raise global GDP by 4 to 6 percentage points—twice that credited to the
Uruguay Round—as well as raise the long-run global growth rate from 3.2 to 5.0 percent.4
While the transition to liberalization is  almost never without cost, liberalizing services

promises more comprehensive benefits since services are an input to production in virtually

all sectors of the economy.  In contrast, liberalization of selected goods sectors has a narrower

conduit through which it affects the overall economy.

•  Electronic commerce is global from the very start.  While traditional borders still matter in

the world of international trade, electronic commerce diminishes their importance.  No longer

do customers need to be physically present to see or hear what they are buying.  As a result,

companies on the Internet instantly become international: Amazon was selling books to

customers in over 40 countries in its first month of existence; the company now sells a variety

of products to customers in over 160 countries. The electronic marketplace is currently free

from explicit trade barriers.  The absence of international tariffs or other barriers on electronic

commerce encourages more people to try and to continue using the internet marketplace,

creating a greater level of efficiency and economic benefit for its participants.

•  Electronic commerce is integral to existing WTO commitments.  While there are currently no

explicit trade barriers on electronic commerce, the infrastructures that make electronic

commerce possible are still burdened by a myriad of trade and investment barriers.  The

growth of electronic commerce depends on continued liberalization of these infrastructures,

many of which are already part of WTO commitments.  Most important are computers and

other information technology products (covered by ITA I and under consideration for ITA II),

telecommunications (covered by the Basic Telecommunications Agreement), financial

services (addressed in the Financial Services Agreement), distribution (relevant under

TRIMS), and delivery services (under consideration for GATS 2000), among others.

Exploiting the synergies among these service sectors allows electronic commerce to flourish

and maximizes economic benefits.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS AN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY

Estimates of the growth of internet usage and electronic commerce both within domestic markets

and worldwide are notorious for their hyperbole.  Even so, each year the actual growth has

surpassed the estimate rather than falling short of it.  Respected sources such as Forrester

Research expect worldwide electronic commerce revenues to surpass $300 billion by 2002 and

accelerate to $1.3 trillion in 2003.  Currently an overwhelming (close to 85%) share of electronic

commerce is concentrated in the United States, but diffusion into Europe and Asia, followed by

Latin America and Africa will be rapid.

In developing countries internet use and its economic potential are growing

exponentially.  The share of active internet users in Asia/Pacific Rim, Latin America, and “rest of
world” could increase from 23 percent in 1999 to 35 percent in 2002.5   In India, for example, the
number of internet users nearly doubled in the last year to 270,000, and could rise to over 2
million by the end of 2000.6  E-commerce revenues could jump from $2.8 million in 1998 to
$575 million in 2002.  In China, a reported 60 percent of businesses are using the internet, and e-
commerce revenues could rise from $11.7 million in 1998 to $1.9 billion in 2002.7  In Latin
America, internet usage rose nearly eight-fold between 1995 and 1997 with revenues estimated to
be $167 million in 1998 and projected to be $8 billion by 2003.8 Africa is fully wired now that
Somalia recently added its first ISP; in South Africa, electronic commerce is expected to generate
US $1.1 billion in 1999.9

Two important facts about e-commerce are often overlooked.  First, the vast bulk of the

actual and to an even greater extent the expected growth in revenues from e-commerce comes

from business-to-business transactions.  In 1998, the ratio of B-to-B over B-to-C was 5.5 to 1; but

by 2003 the ratio is expected to be 12 to 1. Second, in virtually all countries other than the United

States, electronic commerce is export oriented.  In the US, the share of export sales in total e-

commerce revenues is only 10 percent, but in Canada it is 83 percent, in Latin America it
averages 79 percent, and in Asia/Pacific it is 38 percent.10

Moreover, the nature of the production process (comprising both manufacturing and

services) is becoming increasingly fragmented and globalized.11  Multinational firms and strategic
business alliances communicate, get price quotes, submit bids, transfer data, produce product

designs, and basically do business in an international arena.  Countries that do not have an

environment conducive to internet usage and electronic commerce will be marginalized from the

globalized production process and global economy, at increasingly great cost to their citizens.

These observations have important implications for both domestic policy and

international negotiations.  First, business to business transactions often build on existing legal

and regulatory foundations from physical trade so that issues of content, liability, and encryption

are more easily surmounted.  On the other hand, the importance of B-to-B and the desire to create

a level-playing field for all size businesses highlight the need for the international arena to offer a

transparent and codified approach to these issues.

DOMESTIC REFORMS WILL SPEED THE UPTAKE OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Developing countries need to address a number of socioeconomic and regulatory barriers before

their electronic commerce and internet use matches that of the United States or Europe.  While

the socioeconomic challenges are difficult to surmount and will be slower to achieve, the path to

reducing regulatory barriers is clearer and the benefits quicker to observe.  High Internet access

rates, low penetration of electronic means of payment (such as credit, debit, or Smart cards), and

cumbersome delivery systems are primary obstacles to the growth of electronic commerce in

developing countries.

One area that is most easily quantified and compared is internet monthly access fees.

ITU data show that these fees vary substantially across countries and that the share of the fees

accounted for by ISP charges versus accounted for by local telephone charges also varies

substantially.  For example, in the US, the approximately $20 per month internet access charge is

all an ISP charge.  In Korea, the $25 charge is about 1/3 ISP charge and 2/3 local call charges. In

Brazil, the $37 charge is nearly all a local ISP charge.  In China, the $65 charge is about half ISP
charge and about half a local phone charge.12 More importantly, when adjusted by the level of per
capita GDP, the differences in charges is tremendous.  For example, in the US and Australia fees

are about $25 per month, accounting for less than 2 percent of monthly GDP per capita.   In

contrast, in Mexico, the fee at about $27 per month accounts for about 5 percent of monthly

income and in Mozambique, that $27 per month accounts for about 70 percent of monthly GDP
per capita.13

Because the internet creates a new electronic businesses environment, “surfing” is a key

way for users to see what businesses are now doing, and what market niches remain to be

exploited.  Consequently, large “entry” and on-going costs are a great disincentive to internet

usage and therefore to the development of e-commerce business both within a country and for

international trade.  Competition, both for telephone access as well as among ISPs is a key area

where government policy can make a difference in access and uptake of the internet.

Second, a supportive electronic payments infrastructure is crucial to promote electronic

commerce, which exposes a key link between electronic commerce and the financial foundation

of the economy.  The efficiency of the payments system itself can help or hinder the development

of electronic commerce.  Issues of security for transactions, types of electronic media or

techniques for making transactions, as well authorization and clearing functions are key aspects

of the problem.

Electronic payments require an easy-to-use and secure payment vehicle.  Although a

number of countries are focussing on “cash on delivery” for tangible products, the future will

require a payment method that is on-line so as to accommodate products (both goods and

services) delivered digitally.  For business-to-business transactions, an easy-to-use electronic

payments mechanism is crucial to achieve the cost reductions promised by internet-based

commerce.  In addition, security for financial transactions is the sine qua non; electronic payment

must be secure and legal, with liability clearly identified, limited, and prosecuted.

Eighty percent of e-commerce transactions use credit cards, even as debit, smart cards or

digital cash are being viewed as alternatives.  Credit-card penetration by countries varies widely

and for various reasons.  In some countries, including China, the preference for cash to avoid

audit trails undermines the use of credit cards as the basis for electronic commerce transactions,

even as other forms of internet usage (such as e-mail) has risen. In other countries, such as

Taiwan, people are unwilling to use credit cards for internet transactions because there is

unlimited liability in the case of fraudulent use of the credit card number.  Finally, the additional

charge to businesses (which in some cases is transferred in full to the customer) for the use of an

internationally recognized credit card can be as high as 5 to 7 percent of the transaction (for
example in Bulgaria), much too high to be acceptable to business or consumer. 14

Beyond individual transactions, full efficiency and realization of the benefits of e-

commerce depends on rapid authorization, payments, and settlement of accounts through the

“financial plumbing” of the economy.  At minimum, authorization for transactions between

internet businesses and payment institutions (such as credit card companies or banks) needs to be

in real time, so as to allow immediate delivery of digital products.  Moreover, the shorter the time

between authorization and actual payment, the more efficient the transaction and the lower the

institutional risk.  Many developing countries do not have financial institutions or central bank

payments mechanisms that are up to this task.

When countries maintain controls on foreign exchange usage, full participation in e-

commerce for international trade is problematical.  Some countries allow exporters greater access

to international exchange than other businesses (as in Morocco, for example).  This strategy could

limit the development of electronic commerce by indigenous small businesses who need to

 

8

import in order to produce for a market niche in the external or even for the domestic market;

Saffron producers, for example, may achieve greater global sales by importing marketing

expertise over the internet. The desire to maintain a closed capital account but an open current

account (as in Sri Lanka for example) is more difficult when the nature of the internet

transactions is not transparent to the authorities;  who can tell whether the cross-border credit-
card payment was for a US Treasury bond rather than for a Dell computer?15

Finally, distribution and delivery systems round out the set of service infrastructures that

are key components to developing e-commerce. Speed is one of the most important

manifestations of electronic commerce.  Overnight delivery, just-in-time processing, 24 by 7

operations all are examples of how much faster and more precisely timed economic activities are

in the e-commerce world.  A country with inefficient distribution and delivery systems and

without multi-modal transport for international participation will be left behind in e-commerce.

Moreover, there is a very important link between the effectiveness of the distribution and

delivery systems and the incentives for the private sector to innovate and invest in new

technology.  Suppose the private sector spends money on internet technologies, but cannot get

products to customers because of distribution and delivery barriers, as was the case for apparel

producers in Sri Lanka attempting to break into the upscale international fashion market.  When

the economic benefits that might accrue to the private company are eroded by inefficiencies

elsewhere in the chain-to-market, it reduces the incentives for further private investment in
known technologies as well as creates a barrier to innovating new ideas for the local market. 16

How should policymakers respond to these needs for domestic reforms?  First, clear

synergies exist between the elements of policy reform.  Making substantial progress on one

element (such as telephone charges) will reap smaller rewards than expected because of the tight

relationship between the three foundations for e-commerce readiness.  Second, exploiting existing

technology available worldwide has great advantages of interoperability and can jump-start the

globalization of domestic producers.  Finally, the greatest innovation, profit, and increase in

economic well-being will be generated by private sector entrepreneurs serving market niches

unique to the home country, since only domestic entrepreneurs are truly able to understand their

own market.  Domestic policy might favor international infrastructures and overseas innovation

when network externalities and interoperability are important to create the needed foundation for

domestic initiatives.  The ones who benefit will be domestic entrepreneurs.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS IN THE WTO

The WTO has done a substantial amount of work with regard to electronic commerce, but the

cross-cutting and rapidly evolving environment of electronic commerce poses a true challenge

both to the organizing structure of the WTO (GATT and GATS, and role of subcommittees), as

well as to the operational method of its members (request-offer negotiations and negative vs.
positive commitments). 17  One the other hand, traditional WTO principles of non-discrimination,
transparency, neutrality, and market openness remain valid and should be applied to electronic

commerce.  New rules are not necessary if liberalizing commitments embodied in GATT, GATS,

TRIPs, and other WTO agreements are honored.

Probably the key issue is whether electronic commerce and digitized products should be

classified into GATT, GATS, both, or neither.  The European Union strongly asserts that “all

electronic transmissions consist of services;” and, therefore, these products should fall under the
purview of GATS.18  Most countries, including the US, agree that services delivered over the
internet are covered by GATS, but other products are more like a good or are a hybrid between a

good and a service (electronic books are a popular example).  Thus the US is arguing that more

time is needed to monitor the development of electronic commerce before any final classification

takes place. A key point is that classifying these products under GATS could make their treatment

under the WTO less liberal, because market access in GATS exists only in sectors where

members have made specific commitments (software downloaded from the Internet, for example,

is not covered by GATS).  Moreover, whether existing commitments include electronic
transmissions as a mode of delivery is itself under contention. 19

A compromise that would yield the greatest liberalization sidesteps the classification

issue and requires that WTO members follow the course of most liberal treatment of these

products, either under GATT or GATS, particularly when a specific product does not fit neatly

within a negotiated service sector commitment. In some cases, this could mean that electronic

delivery of goods and services would be treated more favorably than other forms of delivery.  For

example, financial products or architectural services could be sold over the internet even as the

physical presence of a foreign bank or licensing of foreign architects had not yet been scheduled

for liberalization under GATS.  This liberalization bias engendered by electronic commerce can

act as a positive force, stimulating further the development of electronic commerce, as well as
encouraging deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.20

Governments do have a legitimate concern that their standards and regulations (e.g.,

pharmaceutical prescriptions, gambling restrictions, and the prudential regulation of banks) might

be undermined by the more favorable treatment afforded by electronic commerce.  Now is a good

time for governments to review how electronic commerce puts stress on existing standards and

regulations, and to decide what combination of private sector response and public legislation will

ensure the greatest benefits of electronic commerce for their citizens.

Moreover, societies do differ in their preferences toward certain aspects of privacy and

levels of security (among other things), and governments are elected to represent those views.

Diversity in the level of government intervention into some areas of governance of the electronic

commerce environment could be appropriate, and appears to be inevitable in any case.

Given the global nature of electronic commerce, governments should try to coordinate

(which need not mean harmonize) new regulations with other countries on a bilateral and

multilateral basis.  What does this mean?  An example in the area of privacy regulation illustrates

the idea. As background and in simple terms, the US approach to privacy is to let the private

sector offer different levels of privacy, whereas the European Union Privacy Directive mandates a
particular level of privacy.21 Do these different approaches become a barrier to cross-border trade,
or can a “trusted third party”, a private firm, bridge these two approaches to privacy?  Such a firm

would investigate the privacy policies and methods of the US firm and guarantee that it was

abiding by the EU Directive; the EU would give the firm its seal of approval that its methods met
the standards of the EU. 22 This represents a market-oriented solution to the need to arbitrage
across the desire for firms to trade data across borders and the desire by societies (or at least

governments) to have different approaches to privacy.

 A second issue relevant for developing countries and the WTO is negotiating method.

This issue grows out of the synergies between the elements of e-commerce readiness.  Because of

these synergies, country delegations will begin emphasizing the “horizontal’’ approach to

negotiations on electronic commerce.  The initial US proposal on services in mid-summer 1999

                                                
20 William Drake and Kalypso Nicolaides in  their “The Information Revolution and Services Trade
Liberalization After 2000”, manuscript for WSC conference “Services 2000: New Directions in Services
Trade Liberalization, June 1999, argue that this approach in effect changes the outcome of the negotiations
agreed to in the Uruguay Round.  As negotiators, they are correct.  However, from the standpoint of
economic well-being, the liberalizing bias is to be welcomed, not voided.
21 The privacy issue is quite complex and evolving and cannot be fully developed here.  See Peter Swire
and Robert Litan, None of Your Business,  Brookings Institution, 1998
22 The firm Privacy Council is one company attempting to meet this market need.

 

11

argued for the “use of all appropriate negotiating modalities, including request-offer, horizontal,
and sectoral approaches.”23   In the horizontal approach, negotiators seek to apply liberalizing
measures, such as transparency and good governance in regulations as well as consistency of

ownership across sectors, to a broad range of services.  For example, negotiators would seek to

eliminate any discrimination across a particular mode of delivery – like electronic commerce or

rights of establishment – across a range of services, such as financial services and small package
delivery.24  This horizontal approach in negotiations is consistent with and formally extends the
liberalization bias engendered by electronic commerce.

A final question of particular relevance for the developing countries is the WTO work

program on electronic commerce.  WTO members also need to decide how, or whether, to

continue the WTO’s work program on electronic commerce.  The different country positions on

this issue mirror the debate over how to classify e-commerce trade.  The EU asserts that because

all electronic deliveries are services, the work program must proceed under the auspices of the

Services Council. Before the Seattle Ministerial, the developing countries, were finding it

difficult to staff all the meetings taking place in the various councils and thus preferred to have

electronic commerce addressed only in the General Council.  To promote the cross-cutting nature

of electronic commerce, the US is proposing that a “non-negotiating working group” be set up in

the WTO’s General Council.  This proposal would satisfy the needs of the developing countries,

but would not presuppose the outcome of the classification issue.

A future WTO work program on electronic commerce should have the following

features: First, it should be reconstituted under the General Council rather than fragmented

throughout the WTO.  While input from the different councils and committees is important, the

cross-cutting nature of electronic commerce means that leadership from the General Council is

key.  Moreover, close coordination of the work program under the General Council will help

developing countries, which have smaller negotiating staffs, participate more fully.

Second, private sector participation has been the hallmark of all the regional trade

forums’ discussions of electronic commerce (including those proceeding under APEC and

FTAA). The private sector is leading the way in setting global technological standards for

electronic commerce; it can also help resolve policymaking concerns such as tax administration

SUMMARY

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that improve

domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid integration

into globalization of production, and leap-frogging of available technology.  Since electronic

commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception, negotiating on

trade issues related to electronic commerce will, even more than trade negotiations have in the

past, demand self-inspection of key domestic policies, particularly in telecommunications,

financial services, and distribution and delivery.  Because these sectors are fundamental to the

workings of a modern economy, liberalization here will rebound to greater economic well-being

than comparable liberalization in more narrowly focussed sectors.  Thus, the desire to be part of

the e-commerce wave can be a powerful force to erode domestic vested interests that have slowed

the liberalization of these sectors.

Technical aspects of electronic commerce, its complexity and the characteristic of

network externalities should change the way that developing countries approach the external

negotiating process.  Specifically, the complexity of negotiations will require more cooperative

effort among countries through their regional forums (APEC, FTAA) which heretofore have

operated at the periphery of the WTO process.  Second, since electronic commerce is

characterized by network externalities, developing countries should take advantage of the

technical leadership coming out of the private sector in the most advanced countries (and their

own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft” in behind. Standing on the shoulders of giants

makes sense when network externalities and interoperable standards are key to maximizing the

benefits of e-commerce. Trying to develop domestic standards or following the old technique of

import substitution to develop a domestic industry is even more economically wasteful in the

context of the internet and electronic commerce than it was in more traditional sectors.

Trade negotiations are often the tool used to liberalize domestic sectors.  But the

complementarity between domestic policy and trade strategy is tighter in the case of e-commerce

and the internet.  Moreover, this complementarity emphasizes that e-commerce is not a service,

nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the context of the WTO commitments,

embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of electronic delivery of goods and

services as compared to delivery by another scheduled mode.  For example, insurance products

could be sold over the Internet even if the physical presence of a foreign insurance firm was not

scheduled for liberalization under GATS. Rather than view this outcome with alarm, developing

countries should embrace it as a positive force that furthers the development both of electronic

commerce, as well as encourages deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MERGES THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL
MARKETPLACES

“Electronic commerce” is a shorthand term that embraces a complex amalgam of technologies,

infrastructures, processes, and products.  It brings together whole industries and narrow

applications, producers and users, information exchange and economic activity into a global

marketplace called “the Internet.”  There is no universal definition of electronic commerce

because the Internet marketplace and its participants are so numerous and their intricate
relationships are evolving so rapidly.1  Nonetheless, one of the best ways of understanding
electronic commerce is to consider the elements of its infrastructure, its impact on the traditional

marketplace, and the continuum of ways in which electronic commerce is manifested.  This

approach shows clearly how electronic commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic

economic activity and international trade.

Electronic commerce as it has evolved today requires three types of infrastructure:

•  Technological infrastructure to create an Internet marketplace.  Electronic commerce relies
on a variety of technologies, the development of which are proceeding at breakneck speeds

(e.g., interconnectivity among telecommunications, cable, satellite, or other Internet

‘backbone;’ Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect market participants to that backbone;

and end-user devices such as PCs, TVs, or mobile telephones).

•  Process infrastructure to connect the Internet marketplace to the traditional marketplace.

This infrastructure makes payment over the Internet possible (through credit, debit, or Smart

cards, or through online currencies).  It also makes possible the distribution and delivery

(whether online or physical) of those products purchased over the Internet to the consumer.
•  “Infrastructure” of protocols, laws, and regulations.  This infrastructure affects the conduct

of those businesses engaging in and impacted by electronic commerce, as well as the

relationships between businesses, consumers, and government.  Examples include technical

communications and interconnectivity standards; the legality and modality of digital

signatures, certification, and encryption; and disclosure, privacy, and content regulations.

 

Together, these infrastructures enable electronic commerce to innovate the traditional

marketplace in three ways:
•  Process innovations: Electronic commerce simplifies, makes more efficient, reduces costs, or
otherwise alters the process by which an existing transaction takes place.  For example, Cisco

Systems replaced its phone and fax ordering process with an online ordering process and
saved more than one-half billion dollars and reduced error rates from 25 percent to 2 percent.2
Boeing used computer-aided design and electronic communication to coordinate 238 design

teams in the globalized production of the 777 aircraft, a process never before attempted in
this way, and which cut error rates by 50 percent, and reduced both costs and time to market.3
•  Product innovations:  Electronic commerce creates or facilitates new industries and products

not previously available.  For example, MP3 both enables consumers to play music

downloaded from a computer and enables musicians to upload music directly to the internet,

thereby creating a new medium to produce and consume music; WebMD repackages existing

health information in an easy-to-use online format, offers opportunities to “chat” with people

with similar health concerns, and provides “real-time” responses to health questions.

•  Market innovations: Electronic commerce also creates new markets in time, space, and in
information that heretofore did not exist because transaction and coordination costs were

prohibitively high.  For example, the online bank Wingspan offers 24-hour bill payment

features; PeopleLink is a global advertising location for artisans in remote parts of Latin

America and Africa; reverse auctions through Priceline inform businesses of the exact price a

consumer is willing to pay for the products, as well as reduce the consumer’s purchase cost.

In reviewing the infrastructures that make electronic commerce possible, as well as the

impact electronic commerce has on the traditional marketplace, we can see how electronic

commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic economic activity and international

trade.
•  The infrastructures on which e-commerce depends also are key to domestic activity.  The

three service-sector infrastructures of telecoms, financial services, and distribution and

delivery are critical components for overall economic activity.  Comprehensive liberalization

of services could raise global GDP by 4 to 6 percentage points—twice that credited to the
Uruguay Round—as well as raise the long-run global growth rate from 3.2 to 5.0 percent.4
While the transition to liberalization is  almost never without cost, liberalizing services

promises more comprehensive benefits since services are an input to production in virtually

all sectors of the economy.  In contrast, liberalization of selected goods sectors has a narrower

conduit through which it affects the overall economy.

•  Electronic commerce is global from the very start.  While traditional borders still matter in

the world of international trade, electronic commerce diminishes their importance.  No longer

do customers need to be physically present to see or hear what they are buying.  As a result,

companies on the Internet instantly become international: Amazon was selling books to

customers in over 40 countries in its first month of existence; the company now sells a variety

of products to customers in over 160 countries. The electronic marketplace is currently free

from explicit trade barriers.  The absence of international tariffs or other barriers on electronic

commerce encourages more people to try and to continue using the internet marketplace,

creating a greater level of efficiency and economic benefit for its participants.

•  Electronic commerce is integral to existing WTO commitments.  While there are currently no

explicit trade barriers on electronic commerce, the infrastructures that make electronic

commerce possible are still burdened by a myriad of trade and investment barriers.  The

growth of electronic commerce depends on continued liberalization of these infrastructures,

many of which are already part of WTO commitments.  Most important are computers and

other information technology products (covered by ITA I and under consideration for ITA II),

telecommunications (covered by the Basic Telecommunications Agreement), financial

services (addressed in the Financial Services Agreement), distribution (relevant under

TRIMS), and delivery services (under consideration for GATS 2000), among others.

Exploiting the synergies among these service sectors allows electronic commerce to flourish

and maximizes economic benefits.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS AN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY

Estimates of the growth of internet usage and electronic commerce both within domestic markets

and worldwide are notorious for their hyperbole.  Even so, each year the actual growth has

surpassed the estimate rather than falling short of it.  Respected sources such as Forrester

Research expect worldwide electronic commerce revenues to surpass $300 billion by 2002 and

accelerate to $1.3 trillion in 2003.  Currently an overwhelming (close to 85%) share of electronic

commerce is concentrated in the United States, but diffusion into Europe and Asia, followed by

Latin America and Africa will be rapid.

In developing countries internet use and its economic potential are growing

exponentially.  The share of active internet users in Asia/Pacific Rim, Latin America, and “rest of
world” could increase from 23 percent in 1999 to 35 percent in 2002.5   In India, for example, the
number of internet users nearly doubled in the last year to 270,000, and could rise to over 2
million by the end of 2000.6  E-commerce revenues could jump from $2.8 million in 1998 to
$575 million in 2002.  In China, a reported 60 percent of businesses are using the internet, and e-
commerce revenues could rise from $11.7 million in 1998 to $1.9 billion in 2002.7  In Latin
America, internet usage rose nearly eight-fold between 1995 and 1997 with revenues estimated to
be $167 million in 1998 and projected to be $8 billion by 2003.8 Africa is fully wired now that
Somalia recently added its first ISP; in South Africa, electronic commerce is expected to generate
US $1.1 billion in 1999.9

Two important facts about e-commerce are often overlooked.  First, the vast bulk of the

actual and to an even greater extent the expected growth in revenues from e-commerce comes

from business-to-business transactions.  In 1998, the ratio of B-to-B over B-to-C was 5.5 to 1; but

by 2003 the ratio is expected to be 12 to 1. Second, in virtually all countries other than the United

States, electronic commerce is export oriented.  In the US, the share of export sales in total e-

commerce revenues is only 10 percent, but in Canada it is 83 percent, in Latin America it
averages 79 percent, and in Asia/Pacific it is 38 percent.10

Moreover, the nature of the production process (comprising both manufacturing and

services) is becoming increasingly fragmented and globalized.11  Multinational firms and strategic
business alliances communicate, get price quotes, submit bids, transfer data, produce product

designs, and basically do business in an international arena.  Countries that do not have an

environment conducive to internet usage and electronic commerce will be marginalized from the

globalized production process and global economy, at increasingly great cost to their citizens.

These observations have important implications for both domestic policy and

international negotiations.  First, business to business transactions often build on existing legal

and regulatory foundations from physical trade so that issues of content, liability, and encryption

are more easily surmounted.  On the other hand, the importance of B-to-B and the desire to create

a level-playing field for all size businesses highlight the need for the international arena to offer a

transparent and codified approach to these issues.

DOMESTIC REFORMS WILL SPEED THE UPTAKE OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Developing countries need to address a number of socioeconomic and regulatory barriers before

their electronic commerce and internet use matches that of the United States or Europe.  While

the socioeconomic challenges are difficult to surmount and will be slower to achieve, the path to

reducing regulatory barriers is clearer and the benefits quicker to observe.  High Internet access

rates, low penetration of electronic means of payment (such as credit, debit, or Smart cards), and

cumbersome delivery systems are primary obstacles to the growth of electronic commerce in

developing countries.

One area that is most easily quantified and compared is internet monthly access fees.

ITU data show that these fees vary substantially across countries and that the share of the fees

accounted for by ISP charges versus accounted for by local telephone charges also varies

substantially.  For example, in the US, the approximately $20 per month internet access charge is

all an ISP charge.  In Korea, the $25 charge is about 1/3 ISP charge and 2/3 local call charges. In

Brazil, the $37 charge is nearly all a local ISP charge.  In China, the $65 charge is about half ISP
charge and about half a local phone charge.12 More importantly, when adjusted by the level of per
capita GDP, the differences in charges is tremendous.  For example, in the US and Australia fees

are about $25 per month, accounting for less than 2 percent of monthly GDP per capita.   In

contrast, in Mexico, the fee at about $27 per month accounts for about 5 percent of monthly

income and in Mozambique, that $27 per month accounts for about 70 percent of monthly GDP
per capita.13

Because the internet creates a new electronic businesses environment, “surfing” is a key

way for users to see what businesses are now doing, and what market niches remain to be

exploited.  Consequently, large “entry” and on-going costs are a great disincentive to internet

usage and therefore to the development of e-commerce business both within a country and for

international trade.  Competition, both for telephone access as well as among ISPs is a key area

where government policy can make a difference in access and uptake of the internet.

Second, a supportive electronic payments infrastructure is crucial to promote electronic

commerce, which exposes a key link between electronic commerce and the financial foundation

of the economy.  The efficiency of the payments system itself can help or hinder the development

of electronic commerce.  Issues of security for transactions, types of electronic media or

techniques for making transactions, as well authorization and clearing functions are key aspects

of the problem.

Electronic payments require an easy-to-use and secure payment vehicle.  Although a

number of countries are focussing on “cash on delivery” for tangible products, the future will

require a payment method that is on-line so as to accommodate products (both goods and

services) delivered digitally.  For business-to-business transactions, an easy-to-use electronic

payments mechanism is crucial to achieve the cost reductions promised by internet-based

commerce.  In addition, security for financial transactions is the sine qua non; electronic payment

must be secure and legal, with liability clearly identified, limited, and prosecuted.

Eighty percent of e-commerce transactions use credit cards, even as debit, smart cards or

digital cash are being viewed as alternatives.  Credit-card penetration by countries varies widely

and for various reasons.  In some countries, including China, the preference for cash to avoid

audit trails undermines the use of credit cards as the basis for electronic commerce transactions,

even as other forms of internet usage (such as e-mail) has risen. In other countries, such as

Taiwan, people are unwilling to use credit cards for internet transactions because there is

unlimited liability in the case of fraudulent use of the credit card number.  Finally, the additional

charge to businesses (which in some cases is transferred in full to the customer) for the use of an

internationally recognized credit card can be as high as 5 to 7 percent of the transaction (for
example in Bulgaria), much too high to be acceptable to business or consumer. 14

Beyond individual transactions, full efficiency and realization of the benefits of e-

commerce depends on rapid authorization, payments, and settlement of accounts through the

“financial plumbing” of the economy.  At minimum, authorization for transactions between

internet businesses and payment institutions (such as credit card companies or banks) needs to be

in real time, so as to allow immediate delivery of digital products.  Moreover, the shorter the time

between authorization and actual payment, the more efficient the transaction and the lower the

institutional risk.  Many developing countries do not have financial institutions or central bank

payments mechanisms that are up to this task.

When countries maintain controls on foreign exchange usage, full participation in e-

commerce for international trade is problematical.  Some countries allow exporters greater access

to international exchange than other businesses (as in Morocco, for example).  This strategy could

limit the development of electronic commerce by indigenous small businesses who need to

 

8

import in order to produce for a market niche in the external or even for the domestic market;

Saffron producers, for example, may achieve greater global sales by importing marketing

expertise over the internet. The desire to maintain a closed capital account but an open current

account (as in Sri Lanka for example) is more difficult when the nature of the internet

transactions is not transparent to the authorities;  who can tell whether the cross-border credit-
card payment was for a US Treasury bond rather than for a Dell computer?15

Finally, distribution and delivery systems round out the set of service infrastructures that

are key components to developing e-commerce. Speed is one of the most important

manifestations of electronic commerce.  Overnight delivery, just-in-time processing, 24 by 7

operations all are examples of how much faster and more precisely timed economic activities are

in the e-commerce world.  A country with inefficient distribution and delivery systems and

without multi-modal transport for international participation will be left behind in e-commerce.

Moreover, there is a very important link between the effectiveness of the distribution and

delivery systems and the incentives for the private sector to innovate and invest in new

technology.  Suppose the private sector spends money on internet technologies, but cannot get

products to customers because of distribution and delivery barriers, as was the case for apparel

producers in Sri Lanka attempting to break into the upscale international fashion market.  When

the economic benefits that might accrue to the private company are eroded by inefficiencies

elsewhere in the chain-to-market, it reduces the incentives for further private investment in
known technologies as well as creates a barrier to innovating new ideas for the local market. 16

How should policymakers respond to these needs for domestic reforms?  First, clear

synergies exist between the elements of policy reform.  Making substantial progress on one

element (such as telephone charges) will reap smaller rewards than expected because of the tight

relationship between the three foundations for e-commerce readiness.  Second, exploiting existing

technology available worldwide has great advantages of interoperability and can jump-start the

globalization of domestic producers.  Finally, the greatest innovation, profit, and increase in

economic well-being will be generated by private sector entrepreneurs serving market niches

unique to the home country, since only domestic entrepreneurs are truly able to understand their

own market.  Domestic policy might favor international infrastructures and overseas innovation

when network externalities and interoperability are important to create the needed foundation for

domestic initiatives.  The ones who benefit will be domestic entrepreneurs.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS IN THE WTO

The WTO has done a substantial amount of work with regard to electronic commerce, but the

cross-cutting and rapidly evolving environment of electronic commerce poses a true challenge

both to the organizing structure of the WTO (GATT and GATS, and role of subcommittees), as

well as to the operational method of its members (request-offer negotiations and negative vs.
positive commitments). 17  One the other hand, traditional WTO principles of non-discrimination,
transparency, neutrality, and market openness remain valid and should be applied to electronic

commerce.  New rules are not necessary if liberalizing commitments embodied in GATT, GATS,

TRIPs, and other WTO agreements are honored.

Probably the key issue is whether electronic commerce and digitized products should be

classified into GATT, GATS, both, or neither.  The European Union strongly asserts that “all

electronic transmissions consist of services;” and, therefore, these products should fall under the
purview of GATS.18  Most countries, including the US, agree that services delivered over the
internet are covered by GATS, but other products are more like a good or are a hybrid between a

good and a service (electronic books are a popular example).  Thus the US is arguing that more

time is needed to monitor the development of electronic commerce before any final classification

takes place. A key point is that classifying these products under GATS could make their treatment

under the WTO less liberal, because market access in GATS exists only in sectors where

members have made specific commitments (software downloaded from the Internet, for example,

is not covered by GATS).  Moreover, whether existing commitments include electronic
transmissions as a mode of delivery is itself under contention. 19

A compromise that would yield the greatest liberalization sidesteps the classification

issue and requires that WTO members follow the course of most liberal treatment of these

products, either under GATT or GATS, particularly when a specific product does not fit neatly

within a negotiated service sector commitment. In some cases, this could mean that electronic

delivery of goods and services would be treated more favorably than other forms of delivery.  For

example, financial products or architectural services could be sold over the internet even as the

physical presence of a foreign bank or licensing of foreign architects had not yet been scheduled

for liberalization under GATS.  This liberalization bias engendered by electronic commerce can

act as a positive force, stimulating further the development of electronic commerce, as well as
encouraging deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.20

Governments do have a legitimate concern that their standards and regulations (e.g.,

pharmaceutical prescriptions, gambling restrictions, and the prudential regulation of banks) might

be undermined by the more favorable treatment afforded by electronic commerce.  Now is a good

time for governments to review how electronic commerce puts stress on existing standards and

regulations, and to decide what combination of private sector response and public legislation will

ensure the greatest benefits of electronic commerce for their citizens.

Moreover, societies do differ in their preferences toward certain aspects of privacy and

levels of security (among other things), and governments are elected to represent those views.

Diversity in the level of government intervention into some areas of governance of the electronic

commerce environment could be appropriate, and appears to be inevitable in any case.

Given the global nature of electronic commerce, governments should try to coordinate

(which need not mean harmonize) new regulations with other countries on a bilateral and

multilateral basis.  What does this mean?  An example in the area of privacy regulation illustrates

the idea. As background and in simple terms, the US approach to privacy is to let the private

sector offer different levels of privacy, whereas the European Union Privacy Directive mandates a
particular level of privacy.21 Do these different approaches become a barrier to cross-border trade,
or can a “trusted third party”, a private firm, bridge these two approaches to privacy?  Such a firm

would investigate the privacy policies and methods of the US firm and guarantee that it was

abiding by the EU Directive; the EU would give the firm its seal of approval that its methods met
the standards of the EU. 22 This represents a market-oriented solution to the need to arbitrage
across the desire for firms to trade data across borders and the desire by societies (or at least

governments) to have different approaches to privacy.

 A second issue relevant for developing countries and the WTO is negotiating method.

This issue grows out of the synergies between the elements of e-commerce readiness.  Because of

these synergies, country delegations will begin emphasizing the “horizontal’’ approach to

negotiations on electronic commerce.  The initial US proposal on services in mid-summer 1999

                                                
20 William Drake and Kalypso Nicolaides in  their “The Information Revolution and Services Trade
Liberalization After 2000”, manuscript for WSC conference “Services 2000: New Directions in Services
Trade Liberalization, June 1999, argue that this approach in effect changes the outcome of the negotiations
agreed to in the Uruguay Round.  As negotiators, they are correct.  However, from the standpoint of
economic well-being, the liberalizing bias is to be welcomed, not voided.
21 The privacy issue is quite complex and evolving and cannot be fully developed here.  See Peter Swire
and Robert Litan, None of Your Business,  Brookings Institution, 1998
22 The firm Privacy Council is one company attempting to meet this market need.

 

11

argued for the “use of all appropriate negotiating modalities, including request-offer, horizontal,
and sectoral approaches.”23   In the horizontal approach, negotiators seek to apply liberalizing
measures, such as transparency and good governance in regulations as well as consistency of

ownership across sectors, to a broad range of services.  For example, negotiators would seek to

eliminate any discrimination across a particular mode of delivery – like electronic commerce or

rights of establishment – across a range of services, such as financial services and small package
delivery.24  This horizontal approach in negotiations is consistent with and formally extends the
liberalization bias engendered by electronic commerce.

A final question of particular relevance for the developing countries is the WTO work

program on electronic commerce.  WTO members also need to decide how, or whether, to

continue the WTO’s work program on electronic commerce.  The different country positions on

this issue mirror the debate over how to classify e-commerce trade.  The EU asserts that because

all electronic deliveries are services, the work program must proceed under the auspices of the

Services Council. Before the Seattle Ministerial, the developing countries, were finding it

difficult to staff all the meetings taking place in the various councils and thus preferred to have

electronic commerce addressed only in the General Council.  To promote the cross-cutting nature

of electronic commerce, the US is proposing that a “non-negotiating working group” be set up in

the WTO’s General Council.  This proposal would satisfy the needs of the developing countries,

but would not presuppose the outcome of the classification issue.

A future WTO work program on electronic commerce should have the following

features: First, it should be reconstituted under the General Council rather than fragmented

throughout the WTO.  While input from the different councils and committees is important, the

cross-cutting nature of electronic commerce means that leadership from the General Council is

key.  Moreover, close coordination of the work program under the General Council will help

developing countries, which have smaller negotiating staffs, participate more fully.

Second, private sector participation has been the hallmark of all the regional trade

forums’ discussions of electronic commerce (including those proceeding under APEC and

FTAA). The private sector is leading the way in setting global technological standards for

electronic commerce; it can also help resolve policymaking concerns such as tax administration

and privacy protection.  Private sector participation and contribution to the WTO work program is

therefore vital.

WTO members face an important watershed: to establish a predictable environment in

which electronic commerce can thrive, allowing the benefits of this new form of international

trade to be realized by all consumers in all countries.  In accomplishing these objectives, the

WTO can work to ensure that electronic commerce remains free from international trade barriers

and continues to drive domestic and global growth.

HOW SHOULD DEVELOPING COUNTRIES APPROACH NEGOTIATIONS IN
THE WTO?

The issues involved with electronic commerce are extremely complex, not only within a country

but perhaps even more so between countries in the international arena.  Leveraging human and

administrative capital resources, both in negotiation and non-negotiating bodies is a must, both to

keep up with e-commerce knowledge and to gain more traction in international negotiations.  But

the WTO negotiations obviously address more than just e-commerce; developing countries may

be able to leverage their greater participation in e-commerce into greater openness in sectors of

their traditional interest.

Many developing countries are already members of regional groups, such as APEC,

FTAA, SADC (Southern Africa Development Community).  Some of these groups have forums

for private sector interaction, such as through the FTAA’s Joint Private Sector Committee of

Exports and APEC’s Pacific Basin Economic Council.  Such venues could increase the potential

for public-private investment partnerships in key infrastructures.  In addition, such interaction can

help ensure that governmental initiatives are interoperable with the global private sector, as in

standards setting for example.

WTO negotiations involve political as well as economic considerations and therefore,

inevitably involve trading-off of one sector for another.  Electronic commerce offers particular

promise to developing countries.  Market innovations and improved market efficiencies gained

through electronic commerce and its prerequisite infrastructures will have the greatest impact in

those sectors and countries where coordination and transactions costs are highest.  By the same

token, US businesses and workers, especially in the high-tech and service sectors, stand to benefit

from the liberalization of electronic commerce and its infrastructures.  Other countries also stand

to benefit through the new opportunities created by electronic commerce, as well as through the

increased efficiencies electronic commerce is making to traditional sectors.  This is a clear win-

win proposition for both the industrial and developing countries.

SUMMARY

Electronic commerce and its related activities over the internet can be the engines that improve

domestic economic well-being through liberalization of domestic services, more rapid integration

into globalization of production, and leap-frogging of available technology.  Since electronic

commerce integrates the domestic and global markets from its very inception, negotiating on

trade issues related to electronic commerce will, even more than trade negotiations have in the

past, demand self-inspection of key domestic policies, particularly in telecommunications,

financial services, and distribution and delivery.  Because these sectors are fundamental to the

workings of a modern economy, liberalization here will rebound to greater economic well-being

than comparable liberalization in more narrowly focussed sectors.  Thus, the desire to be part of

the e-commerce wave can be a powerful force to erode domestic vested interests that have slowed

the liberalization of these sectors.

Technical aspects of electronic commerce, its complexity and the characteristic of

network externalities should change the way that developing countries approach the external

negotiating process.  Specifically, the complexity of negotiations will require more cooperative

effort among countries through their regional forums (APEC, FTAA) which heretofore have

operated at the periphery of the WTO process.  Second, since electronic commerce is

characterized by network externalities, developing countries should take advantage of the

technical leadership coming out of the private sector in the most advanced countries (and their

own private sector, even if nascent) and “draft” in behind. Standing on the shoulders of giants

makes sense when network externalities and interoperable standards are key to maximizing the

benefits of e-commerce. Trying to develop domestic standards or following the old technique of

import substitution to develop a domestic industry is even more economically wasteful in the

context of the internet and electronic commerce than it was in more traditional sectors.

Trade negotiations are often the tool used to liberalize domestic sectors.  But the

complementarity between domestic policy and trade strategy is tighter in the case of e-commerce

and the internet.  Moreover, this complementarity emphasizes that e-commerce is not a service,

nor a good, but something that is comprised of both.  In the context of the WTO commitments,

embracing this idea could lead to a liberalizing bias in favor of electronic delivery of goods and

services as compared to delivery by another scheduled mode.  For example, insurance products

could be sold over the Internet even if the physical presence of a foreign insurance firm was not

scheduled for liberalization under GATS. Rather than view this outcome with alarm, developing

countries should embrace it as a positive force that furthers the development both of electronic

commerce, as well as encourages deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE MERGES THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL
MARKETPLACES

“Electronic commerce” is a shorthand term that embraces a complex amalgam of technologies,

infrastructures, processes, and products.  It brings together whole industries and narrow

applications, producers and users, information exchange and economic activity into a global

marketplace called “the Internet.”  There is no universal definition of electronic commerce

because the Internet marketplace and its participants are so numerous and their intricate
relationships are evolving so rapidly.1  Nonetheless, one of the best ways of understanding
electronic commerce is to consider the elements of its infrastructure, its impact on the traditional

marketplace, and the continuum of ways in which electronic commerce is manifested.  This

approach shows clearly how electronic commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic

economic activity and international trade.

Electronic commerce as it has evolved today requires three types of infrastructure:

•  Technological infrastructure to create an Internet marketplace.  Electronic commerce relies
on a variety of technologies, the development of which are proceeding at breakneck speeds

(e.g., interconnectivity among telecommunications, cable, satellite, or other Internet

‘backbone;’ Internet service providers (ISPs) to connect market participants to that backbone;

and end-user devices such as PCs, TVs, or mobile telephones).

•  Process infrastructure to connect the Internet marketplace to the traditional marketplace.

This infrastructure makes payment over the Internet possible (through credit, debit, or Smart

cards, or through online currencies).  It also makes possible the distribution and delivery

(whether online or physical) of those products purchased over the Internet to the consumer.
•  “Infrastructure” of protocols, laws, and regulations.  This infrastructure affects the conduct

of those businesses engaging in and impacted by electronic commerce, as well as the

relationships between businesses, consumers, and government.  Examples include technical

communications and interconnectivity standards; the legality and modality of digital

signatures, certification, and encryption; and disclosure, privacy, and content regulations.

 

Together, these infrastructures enable electronic commerce to innovate the traditional

marketplace in three ways:
•  Process innovations: Electronic commerce simplifies, makes more efficient, reduces costs, or
otherwise alters the process by which an existing transaction takes place.  For example, Cisco

Systems replaced its phone and fax ordering process with an online ordering process and
saved more than one-half billion dollars and reduced error rates from 25 percent to 2 percent.2
Boeing used computer-aided design and electronic communication to coordinate 238 design

teams in the globalized production of the 777 aircraft, a process never before attempted in
this way, and which cut error rates by 50 percent, and reduced both costs and time to market.3
•  Product innovations:  Electronic commerce creates or facilitates new industries and products

not previously available.  For example, MP3 both enables consumers to play music

downloaded from a computer and enables musicians to upload music directly to the internet,

thereby creating a new medium to produce and consume music; WebMD repackages existing

health information in an easy-to-use online format, offers opportunities to “chat” with people

with similar health concerns, and provides “real-time” responses to health questions.

•  Market innovations: Electronic commerce also creates new markets in time, space, and in
information that heretofore did not exist because transaction and coordination costs were

prohibitively high.  For example, the online bank Wingspan offers 24-hour bill payment

features; PeopleLink is a global advertising location for artisans in remote parts of Latin

America and Africa; reverse auctions through Priceline inform businesses of the exact price a

consumer is willing to pay for the products, as well as reduce the consumer’s purchase cost.

In reviewing the infrastructures that make electronic commerce possible, as well as the

impact electronic commerce has on the traditional marketplace, we can see how electronic

commerce is intricately woven into the fabric of domestic economic activity and international

trade.
•  The infrastructures on which e-commerce depends also are key to domestic activity.  The

three service-sector infrastructures of telecoms, financial services, and distribution and

delivery are critical components for overall economic activity.  Comprehensive liberalization

of services could raise global GDP by 4 to 6 percentage points—twice that credited to the
Uruguay Round—as well as raise the long-run global growth rate from 3.2 to 5.0 percent.4
While the transition to liberalization is  almost never without cost, liberalizing services

promises more comprehensive benefits since services are an input to production in virtually

all sectors of the economy.  In contrast, liberalization of selected goods sectors has a narrower

conduit through which it affects the overall economy.

•  Electronic commerce is global from the very start.  While traditional borders still matter in

the world of international trade, electronic commerce diminishes their importance.  No longer

do customers need to be physically present to see or hear what they are buying.  As a result,

companies on the Internet instantly become international: Amazon was selling books to

customers in over 40 countries in its first month of existence; the company now sells a variety

of products to customers in over 160 countries. The electronic marketplace is currently free

from explicit trade barriers.  The absence of international tariffs or other barriers on electronic

commerce encourages more people to try and to continue using the internet marketplace,

creating a greater level of efficiency and economic benefit for its participants.

•  Electronic commerce is integral to existing WTO commitments.  While there are currently no

explicit trade barriers on electronic commerce, the infrastructures that make electronic

commerce possible are still burdened by a myriad of trade and investment barriers.  The

growth of electronic commerce depends on continued liberalization of these infrastructures,

many of which are already part of WTO commitments.  Most important are computers and

other information technology products (covered by ITA I and under consideration for ITA II),

telecommunications (covered by the Basic Telecommunications Agreement), financial

services (addressed in the Financial Services Agreement), distribution (relevant under

TRIMS), and delivery services (under consideration for GATS 2000), among others.

Exploiting the synergies among these service sectors allows electronic commerce to flourish

and maximizes economic benefits.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE IS INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS AN ECONOMIC
ACTIVITY

Estimates of the growth of internet usage and electronic commerce both within domestic markets

and worldwide are notorious for their hyperbole.  Even so, each year the actual growth has

surpassed the estimate rather than falling short of it.  Respected sources such as Forrester

Research expect worldwide electronic commerce revenues to surpass $300 billion by 2002 and

accelerate to $1.3 trillion in 2003.  Currently an overwhelming (close to 85%) share of electronic

commerce is concentrated in the United States, but diffusion into Europe and Asia, followed by

Latin America and Africa will be rapid.

In developing countries internet use and its economic potential are growing

exponentially.  The share of active internet users in Asia/Pacific Rim, Latin America, and “rest of
world” could increase from 23 percent in 1999 to 35 percent in 2002.5   In India, for example, the
number of internet users nearly doubled in the last year to 270,000, and could rise to over 2
million by the end of 2000.6  E-commerce revenues could jump from $2.8 million in 1998 to
$575 million in 2002.  In China, a reported 60 percent of businesses are using the internet, and e-
commerce revenues could rise from $11.7 million in 1998 to $1.9 billion in 2002.7  In Latin
America, internet usage rose nearly eight-fold between 1995 and 1997 with revenues estimated to
be $167 million in 1998 and projected to be $8 billion by 2003.8 Africa is fully wired now that
Somalia recently added its first ISP; in South Africa, electronic commerce is expected to generate
US $1.1 billion in 1999.9

Two important facts about e-commerce are often overlooked.  First, the vast bulk of the

actual and to an even greater extent the expected growth in revenues from e-commerce comes

from business-to-business transactions.  In 1998, the ratio of B-to-B over B-to-C was 5.5 to 1; but

by 2003 the ratio is expected to be 12 to 1. Second, in virtually all countries other than the United

States, electronic commerce is export oriented.  In the US, the share of export sales in total e-

commerce revenues is only 10 percent, but in Canada it is 83 percent, in Latin America it
averages 79 percent, and in Asia/Pacific it is 38 percent.10

Moreover, the nature of the production process (comprising both manufacturing and

services) is becoming increasingly fragmented and globalized.11  Multinational firms and strategic
business alliances communicate, get price quotes, submit bids, transfer data, produce product

designs, and basically do business in an international arena.  Countries that do not have an

environment conducive to internet usage and electronic commerce will be marginalized from the

globalized production process and global economy, at increasingly great cost to their citizens.

These observations have important implications for both domestic policy and

international negotiations.  First, business to business transactions often build on existing legal

and regulatory foundations from physical trade so that issues of content, liability, and encryption

are more easily surmounted.  On the other hand, the importance of B-to-B and the desire to create

a level-playing field for all size businesses highlight the need for the international arena to offer a

transparent and codified approach to these issues.

DOMESTIC REFORMS WILL SPEED THE UPTAKE OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Developing countries need to address a number of socioeconomic and regulatory barriers before

their electronic commerce and internet use matches that of the United States or Europe.  While

the socioeconomic challenges are difficult to surmount and will be slower to achieve, the path to

reducing regulatory barriers is clearer and the benefits quicker to observe.  High Internet access

rates, low penetration of electronic means of payment (such as credit, debit, or Smart cards), and

cumbersome delivery systems are primary obstacles to the growth of electronic commerce in

developing countries.

One area that is most easily quantified and compared is internet monthly access fees.

ITU data show that these fees vary substantially across countries and that the share of the fees

accounted for by ISP charges versus accounted for by local telephone charges also varies

substantially.  For example, in the US, the approximately $20 per month internet access charge is

all an ISP charge.  In Korea, the $25 charge is about 1/3 ISP charge and 2/3 local call charges. In

Brazil, the $37 charge is nearly all a local ISP charge.  In China, the $65 charge is about half ISP
charge and about half a local phone charge.12 More importantly, when adjusted by the level of per
capita GDP, the differences in charges is tremendous.  For example, in the US and Australia fees

are about $25 per month, accounting for less than 2 percent of monthly GDP per capita.   In

contrast, in Mexico, the fee at about $27 per month accounts for about 5 percent of monthly

income and in Mozambique, that $27 per month accounts for about 70 percent of monthly GDP
per capita.13

Because the internet creates a new electronic businesses environment, “surfing” is a key

way for users to see what businesses are now doing, and what market niches remain to be

exploited.  Consequently, large “entry” and on-going costs are a great disincentive to internet

usage and therefore to the development of e-commerce business both within a country and for

international trade.  Competition, both for telephone access as well as among ISPs is a key area

where government policy can make a difference in access and uptake of the internet.

Second, a supportive electronic payments infrastructure is crucial to promote electronic

commerce, which exposes a key link between electronic commerce and the financial foundation

of the economy.  The efficiency of the payments system itself can help or hinder the development

of electronic commerce.  Issues of security for transactions, types of electronic media or

techniques for making transactions, as well authorization and clearing functions are key aspects

of the problem.

Electronic payments require an easy-to-use and secure payment vehicle.  Although a

number of countries are focussing on “cash on delivery” for tangible products, the future will

require a payment method that is on-line so as to accommodate products (both goods and

services) delivered digitally.  For business-to-business transactions, an easy-to-use electronic

payments mechanism is crucial to achieve the cost reductions promised by internet-based

commerce.  In addition, security for financial transactions is the sine qua non; electronic payment

must be secure and legal, with liability clearly identified, limited, and prosecuted.

Eighty percent of e-commerce transactions use credit cards, even as debit, smart cards or

digital cash are being viewed as alternatives.  Credit-card penetration by countries varies widely

and for various reasons.  In some countries, including China, the preference for cash to avoid

audit trails undermines the use of credit cards as the basis for electronic commerce transactions,

even as other forms of internet usage (such as e-mail) has risen. In other countries, such as

Taiwan, people are unwilling to use credit cards for internet transactions because there is

unlimited liability in the case of fraudulent use of the credit card number.  Finally, the additional

charge to businesses (which in some cases is transferred in full to the customer) for the use of an

internationally recognized credit card can be as high as 5 to 7 percent of the transaction (for
example in Bulgaria), much too high to be acceptable to business or consumer. 14

Beyond individual transactions, full efficiency and realization of the benefits of e-

commerce depends on rapid authorization, payments, and settlement of accounts through the

“financial plumbing” of the economy.  At minimum, authorization for transactions between

internet businesses and payment institutions (such as credit card companies or banks) needs to be

in real time, so as to allow immediate delivery of digital products.  Moreover, the shorter the time

between authorization and actual payment, the more efficient the transaction and the lower the

institutional risk.  Many developing countries do not have financial institutions or central bank

payments mechanisms that are up to this task.

When countries maintain controls on foreign exchange usage, full participation in e-

commerce for international trade is problematical.  Some countries allow exporters greater access

to international exchange than other businesses (as in Morocco, for example).  This strategy could

limit the development of electronic commerce by indigenous small businesses who need to

 

8

import in order to produce for a market niche in the external or even for the domestic market;

Saffron producers, for example, may achieve greater global sales by importing marketing

expertise over the internet. The desire to maintain a closed capital account but an open current

account (as in Sri Lanka for example) is more difficult when the nature of the internet

transactions is not transparent to the authorities;  who can tell whether the cross-border credit-
card payment was for a US Treasury bond rather than for a Dell computer?15

Finally, distribution and delivery systems round out the set of service infrastructures that

are key components to developing e-commerce. Speed is one of the most important

manifestations of electronic commerce.  Overnight delivery, just-in-time processing, 24 by 7

operations all are examples of how much faster and more precisely timed economic activities are

in the e-commerce world.  A country with inefficient distribution and delivery systems and

without multi-modal transport for international participation will be left behind in e-commerce.

Moreover, there is a very important link between the effectiveness of the distribution and

delivery systems and the incentives for the private sector to innovate and invest in new

technology.  Suppose the private sector spends money on internet technologies, but cannot get

products to customers because of distribution and delivery barriers, as was the case for apparel

producers in Sri Lanka attempting to break into the upscale international fashion market.  When

the economic benefits that might accrue to the private company are eroded by inefficiencies

elsewhere in the chain-to-market, it reduces the incentives for further private investment in
known technologies as well as creates a barrier to innovating new ideas for the local market. 16

How should policymakers respond to these needs for domestic reforms?  First, clear

synergies exist between the elements of policy reform.  Making substantial progress on one

element (such as telephone charges) will reap smaller rewards than expected because of the tight

relationship between the three foundations for e-commerce readiness.  Second, exploiting existing

technology available worldwide has great advantages of interoperability and can jump-start the

globalization of domestic producers.  Finally, the greatest innovation, profit, and increase in

economic well-being will be generated by private sector entrepreneurs serving market niches

unique to the home country, since only domestic entrepreneurs are truly able to understand their

own market.  Domestic policy might favor international infrastructures and overseas innovation

when network externalities and interoperability are important to create the needed foundation for

domestic initiatives.  The ones who benefit will be domestic entrepreneurs.

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE AND INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS IN THE WTO

The WTO has done a substantial amount of work with regard to electronic commerce, but the

cross-cutting and rapidly evolving environment of electronic commerce poses a true challenge

both to the organizing structure of the WTO (GATT and GATS, and role of subcommittees), as

well as to the operational method of its members (request-offer negotiations and negative vs.
positive commitments). 17  One the other hand, traditional WTO principles of non-discrimination,
transparency, neutrality, and market openness remain valid and should be applied to electronic

commerce.  New rules are not necessary if liberalizing commitments embodied in GATT, GATS,

TRIPs, and other WTO agreements are honored.

Probably the key issue is whether electronic commerce and digitized products should be

classified into GATT, GATS, both, or neither.  The European Union strongly asserts that “all

electronic transmissions consist of services;” and, therefore, these products should fall under the
purview of GATS.18  Most countries, including the US, agree that services delivered over the
internet are covered by GATS, but other products are more like a good or are a hybrid between a

good and a service (electronic books are a popular example).  Thus the US is arguing that more

time is needed to monitor the development of electronic commerce before any final classification

takes place. A key point is that classifying these products under GATS could make their treatment

under the WTO less liberal, because market access in GATS exists only in sectors where

members have made specific commitments (software downloaded from the Internet, for example,

is not covered by GATS).  Moreover, whether existing commitments include electronic
transmissions as a mode of delivery is itself under contention. 19

A compromise that would yield the greatest liberalization sidesteps the classification

issue and requires that WTO members follow the course of most liberal treatment of these

products, either under GATT or GATS, particularly when a specific product does not fit neatly

within a negotiated service sector commitment. In some cases, this could mean that electronic

delivery of goods and services would be treated more favorably than other forms of delivery.  For

example, financial products or architectural services could be sold over the internet even as the

physical presence of a foreign bank or licensing of foreign architects had not yet been scheduled

for liberalization under GATS.  This liberalization bias engendered by electronic commerce can

act as a positive force, stimulating further the development of electronic commerce, as well as
encouraging deeper liberalization and deregulation throughout the economy.20

Governments do have a legitimate concern that their standards and regulations (e.g.,

pharmaceutical prescriptions, gambling restrictions, and the prudential regulation of banks) might

be undermined by the more favorable treatment afforded by electronic commerce.  Now is a good

time for governments to review how electronic commerce puts stress on existing standards and

regulations, and to decide what combination of private sector response and public legislation will

ensure the greatest benefits of electronic commerce for their citizens.

Moreover, societies do differ in their preferences toward certain aspects of privacy and

levels of security (among other things), and governments are elected to represent those views.

Diversity in the level of government intervention into some areas of governance of the electronic

commerce environment could be appropriate, and appears to be inevitable in any case.

Given the global nature of electronic commerce, governments should try to coordinate

(which need not mean harmonize) new regulations with other countries on a bilateral and

multilateral basis.  What does this mean?  An example in the area of privacy regulation illustrates

the idea. As background and in simple terms, the US approach to privacy is to let the private

sector offer different levels of privacy, whereas the European Union Privacy Directive mandates a
particular level of privacy.21 Do these different approaches become a barrier to cross-border trade,
or can a “trusted third party”, a private firm, bridge these two approaches to privacy?  Such a firm

would investigate the privacy policies and methods of the US firm and guarantee that it was

abiding by the EU Directive; the EU would give the firm its seal of approval that its methods met
the standards of the EU. 22 This represents a market-oriented solution to the need to arbitrage
across the desire for firms to trade data across borders and the desire by societies (or at least

governments) to have different approaches to privacy.

 A second issue relevant for developing countries and the WTO is negotiating method.

This issue grows out of the synergies between the elements of e-commerce readiness.  Because of

these synergies, country delegations will begin emphasizing the “horizontal’’ approach to

negotiations on electronic commerce.  The initial US proposal on services in mid-summer 1999

                                                
20 William Drake and Kalypso Nicolaides in  their “The Information Revolution and Services Trade
Liberalization After 2000”, manuscript for WSC conference “Services 2000: New Directions in Services
Trade Liberalization, June 1999, argue that this approach in effect changes the outcome of the negotiations
agreed to in the Uruguay Round.  As negotiators, they are correct.  However, from the standpoint of
economic well-being, the liberalizing bias is to be welcomed, not voided.
21 The privacy issue is quite complex and evolving and cannot be fully developed here.  See Peter Swire
and Robert Litan, None of Your Business,  Brookings Institution, 1998

argued for the “use of all appropriate negotiating modalities, including request-offer, horizontal,
and sectoral approaches.”23   In the horizontal approach, negotiators seek to apply liberalizing
measures, such as transparency and good governance in regulations as well as consistency of

ownership across sectors, to a broad range of services.  For example, negotiators would seek to

eliminate any discrimination across a particular mode of delivery – like electronic commerce or

rights of establishment – across a range of services, such as financial services and small package
delivery.24  This horizontal approach in negotiations is consistent with and formally extends the
liberalization bias engendered by electronic commerce.

A final question of particular relevance for the developing countries is the WTO work

program on electronic commerce.  WTO members also need to decide how, or whether, to

continue the WTO’s work program on electronic commerce.  The different country positions on

this issue mirror the debate over how to classify e-commerce trade.  The EU asserts that because

all electronic deliveries are services, the work program must proceed under the auspices of the

Services Council. Before the Seattle Ministerial, the developing countries, were finding it

difficult to staff all the meetings taking place in the various councils and thus preferred to have

electronic commerce addressed only in the General Council.  To promote the cross-cutting nature

of electronic commerce, the US is proposing that a “non-negotiating working group” be set up in

the WTO’s General Council.  This proposal would satisfy the needs of the developing countries,

but would not presuppose the outcome of the classification issue.

A future WTO work program on electronic commerce should have the following

features: First, it should be reconstituted under the General Council rather than fragmented

throughout the WTO.  While input from the different councils and committees is important, the

cross-cutting nature of electronic commerce means that leadership from the General Council is

key.  Moreover, close coordination of the work program under the General Council will help

developing countries, which have smaller negotiating staffs, participate more fully.

Second, private sector participation has been the hallmark of all the regional trade

forums’ discussions of electronic commerce (including those proceeding under APEC and

FTAA). The private sector is leading the way in setting global technological standards for

electronic commerce; it can also help resolve policymaking concerns such as tax administration

and privacy protection.  Private sector participation and contribution to the WTO work program is

therefore vital.

WTO members face an important watershed: to establish a predictable environment in

which electronic commerce can thrive, allowing the benefits of this new form of international

trade to be realized by all consumers in all countries.  In accomplishing these objectives, the

WTO can work to ensure that electronic commerce remains free from international trade barriers

and continues to drive domestic and global growth.

HOW SHOULD DEVELOPING COUNTRIES APPROACH NEGOTIATIONS IN
THE WTO?

The issues involved with electronic commerce are extremely complex, not only within a country

but perhaps even more so between countries in the international arena.  Leveraging human and

administrative capital resources, both in negotiation and non-negotiating bodies is a must, both to

keep up with e-commerce knowledge and to gain more traction in international negotiations.  But

the WTO negotiations obviously address more than just e-commerce; developing countries may

be able to leverage their greater participation in e-commerce into greater openness in sectors of

their traditional interest.

Many developing countries are already members of regional groups, such as APEC,

FTAA, SADC (Southern Africa Development Community).  Some of these groups have forums

for private sector interaction, such as through the FTAA’s Joint Private Sector Committee of

Exports and APEC’s Pacific Basin Economic Council.  Such venues could increase the potential

for public-private investment partnerships in key infrastructures.  In addition, such interaction can

help ensure that governmental initiatives are interoperable with the global private sector, as in

standards setting for example.

WTO negotiations involve political as well as economic considerations and therefore,

inevitably involve trading-off of one sector for another.  Electronic commerce offers particular

promise to developing countries.  Market innovations and improved market efficiencies gained

through electronic commerce and its prerequisite infrastructures will have the greatest impact in

those sectors and countries where coordination and transactions costs are highest.  By the same

token, US businesses and workers, especially in the high-tech and service sectors, stand to benefit

from the liberalization of electronic commerce and its infrastructures.  Other countries also stand

to benefit through the new opportunities created by electronic commerce, as well as through the

increased efficiencies electronic commerce is making to traditional sectors.  This is a clear win-

win proposition for both the industrial and developing countries.

 

13

The overall benefits will be reduced, however, if markets are not open for the goods and

services that developing countries will come to produce more efficiently than they do now.

Developing countries, for example, face US barriers in textiles and apparel and some elements of

data processing, communications and software programming, precisely those areas in which

electronic commerce (and the related improvements in domestic infrastructures) can enhance the

competitiveness of developing country producers. If US negotiators fail to acknowledge the need

to lower these barriers, developing countries may limit their commitments to liberalize key areas

of electronic commerce which would benefit the US and other industrial countries.

The choices are clear and the stakes are enormous.  WTO members can establish a

predictable environment in which electronic commerce can thrive, allowing the benefits of this

new form of international trade to be realized by all consumers in all countries. Or not.  In the US,

where electronic commerce has its strongest hold, the information technology sector contributes

to approximately eight percent of the economy.  The remarkable growth in IT-related industries,

especially those directly linked to electronic commerce, has helped to create the longest period of
economic growth with low inflation in US history.25  Such gains are available to all countries, not
just first-users like the US and Europe; liberalization via electronic commerce is not a “zero-sum

game.”

FINAL REMARKS

Electronic commerce and the internet integrate both services and goods sectors, across domestic

and international boundaries.  Key synergies exist between telecommunications, financial

infrastructure, distribution and delivery, and governance.  The internet and electronic commerce

both depend on and facilitate liberalization in these areas.  The WTO process can help prod

domestic liberalization and open markets abroad.  In addition, it can be a forum where developing

countries use their existing regional relationships to convey information to the individual

countries to raise knowledge levels and work with private sector partners.  Electronic commerce

and the internet represent the opportunity to leap forward to the next stage of economic

development, where value is created not just by resource endowments or manufacturing might,

but also by knowledge, information, and the use of technology.
