ABSTRACT

The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world’s population
thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of
resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efﬁcient city management
has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to ﬁnd
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained signiﬁcant attention over the
past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efﬁcient and effective
resource management in Smart Cities. Today infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it ﬁts with the Internet of
Things. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical, and social
perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues. Copyright c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Smart Cities (SC) [2]
are recent phenomena that have attracted the attention from
both academia and industry. While both ideas consolidate
similar ideology, they have different origins. Both IoT
and SC do not have clear and concise deﬁnitions due to
their short history and broadness. Examining the origins of
both ideas in brief allows us to understand their potentials.
Even though the term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined
in 1999 [3], the technologies that enable IoT such as
sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
we brieﬂy review the trend of everything as service in
Section 2. In Section 3, the sensing as a service model
is presented. Subsequently, we explain the sensing as a
service model using a futuristic scenario in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss several use case scenarios that
highlight the different aspects of the sensing as a service
model. Advantages in sensing as a service model are
discussed in Section 6. Later, in Section 7, we highlight

Smart City initiatives have become another

process inefﬁcient. In XaaS, online retail applications are
hosted in servers facilitated by cloud service provider
where the business is only required to pay for the resource
it consumes. This model works similar to the utility
services such as electricity. Further, cloud computing
service models provide many other beneﬁts such as
business agility, scalability and elasticity, reliability, green
initiatives, less maintenance work including backup and
disaster recovery. Ultimately, XaaS allows businesses to
focus more on core competency and innovation instead of
ICT [14]. Further explanation on characteristics, features
and beneﬁts of cloud computing are presented in [12, 15].
trend
during the past decade. Various city councils, business
organizations, research and academic institutions, and the
governments have invested signiﬁcantly in projects to
study, design, and build solutions to address the problems
in urban cities using ICT. IBM Smart Planet and Smart
Cities, Oracle iGovernment, Amsterdam Smart City, Dubai
SmartCity, EuropeanSmartCities, and Smart Cities Future
are some of the leading Smart City projects [16, 17]. The
following statistics show the magnitude of both trends.
Global cloud computing and XaaS market is expected to
grow from $37.8 billion in 2010 to $121.1 billion by 2015,
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
26.2% from 2010 to 2015 [14]. Similarly, the global Smart
City market is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2016,
growing at a CAGR of 14.2% [18].

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in
detail. As depicted in Figure 3, the sensing as a service
model consists of four conceptual layers: 1) sensors and
sensor owners, 2) sensor publishers, 3) extended service
providers, and 4) sensor data consumers. In this section,
we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic
conceptual form. In Section 4, we present a real world
scenario based on this model. At the end of Section 4, we
map the real world scenario into the conceptual model in
order to provide a practical understanding.

Sensors and Sensor Owners Layer: This layer
consists of sensors and sensor owners. A sensor is a device
that detects, measures or sense a physical phenomenon
such as humidity, temperature, etc. [19]. Multiple sensors
can be attached to an object or device. For example,
microwaves or coffee machines may have sensors that
can be used to detect events (e.g. the number of times
it is used per day and related context information). Such

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

information can be used to understand user behaviour and
user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
we brieﬂy review the trend of everything as service in
Section 2. In Section 3, the sensing as a service model
is presented. Subsequently, we explain the sensing as a
service model using a futuristic scenario in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss several use case scenarios that
highlight the different aspects of the sensing as a service
model. Advantages in sensing as a service model are
discussed in Section 6. Later, in Section 7, we highlight

hosted in servers facilitated by cloud service provider
where the business is only required to pay for the resource
it consumes. This model works similar to the utility
services such as electricity. Further, cloud computing
service models provide many other beneﬁts such as
business agility, scalability and elasticity, reliability, green
initiatives, less maintenance work including backup and
disaster recovery. Ultimately, XaaS allows businesses to

during the past decade. Various city councils, business
organizations, research and academic institutions, and the
governments have invested signiﬁcantly in projects to
study, design, and build solutions to address the problems
in urban cities using ICT. IBM Smart Planet and Smart
Cities, Oracle iGovernment, Amsterdam Smart City, Dubai
SmartCity, EuropeanSmartCities, and Smart Cities Future
are some of the leading Smart City projects [16, 17]. The
following statistics show the magnitude of both trends.
Global cloud computing and XaaS market is expected to
grow from $37.8 billion in 2010 to $121.1 billion by 2015,
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
26.2% from 2010 to 2015 [14]. Similarly, the global Smart
City market is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2016,
growing at a CAGR of 14.2% [18].

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in
detail. As depicted in Figure 3, the sensing as a service
model consists of four conceptual layers: 1) sensors and
sensor owners, 2) sensor publishers, 3) extended service
providers, and 4) sensor data consumers. In this section,
we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic
conceptual form. In Section 4, we present a real world
scenario based on this model. At the end of Section 4, we
map the real world scenario into the conceptual model in
order to provide a practical understanding.

Sensors and Sensor Owners Layer: This layer
consists of sensors and sensor owners. A sensor is a device
that detects, measures or sense a physical phenomenon
such as humidity, temperature, etc. [19]. Multiple sensors
can be attached to an object or device. For example,
microwaves or coffee machines may have sensors that
can be used to detect events (e.g. the number of times
it is used per day and related context information). Such

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

information can be used to understand user behaviour and
user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

shared between SPs if necessary depending on consumer
requirements. Even though all four categories perfom the
same task (i.e. sensor deployment and publication), the
decision making processes can be quite different especially
in term of objectives, ﬁnancial goals, approval processes,
privacy and policy concerns.

Sensor Publishers Layer: This layer consists of sensor
publishers (SP). The main responsibility of a sensor
publisher is to detect available sensors, communicate
with the sensor owners, and get permission to publish
the sensors in the cloud. Sensor publishers are separate
business entities. When a sensor owner
registers a
speciﬁc sensor, SP collects information about the sensor
availability, owner preferences and restriction, expected
return, etc. All this information needs to be published in
the cloud. Once the registration is done, a SP waits until
a sensor consumer makes a request. When a SP receives
such a request, it forwards all the details including the offer
to the corresponding sensor owner(s) to accept or reject.
If the sensor owner accepts the offer, the corresponding
sensor data consumer will be able to acquire data from
that sensor through the SP during the period mentioned
in the agreement (offer). The same interaction explained
above can take place between SPs and ESPs. SPs entirely
depend on the payments (e.g. commission) receives from
sensor owners, sensor data consumers or both. Xively
[22] is a public cloud for the IoT that simpliﬁes and
accelerates the creation, deployment, and management,
of sensors in scalable manner. Further, it allows sharing
sensor data with each other though it is far away from being
qualiﬁed as a SP we envisioned in the sensing as a service
model. The OpenIoT project [23] focuses on providing an
open source middleware framework enabling the dynamic
formulation of self-managed cloud environments for IoT
applications. Global Sensor Networks (GSN) [24] is a
middleware which supports sensor deployments and offers
a ﬂexible, zero-programming deployment and integration
infrastructure for IoT. These approaches strengthen our
vision towards sensing as a service.

Extended Service Providers Layer: This

layer
consists of extended service providers (ESP). This layer
can be considered as the most intelligent among all the
four layers which embed the intelligence to the entire
service model. The services provided by ESPs can be
varied widely from one provider to another. However,
there are some fundamental characteristics of ESPs. To
become an ESP, they have to provide value added services
[25] to the sensor data consumers. However, in some
instances a single business entity can perform both sensor
publisher and extended service provider roles. Each SP
has access (only) to the sensors which are registered with
it. When a sensor data consumer needs sensor data from
multiple sensors where each sensor has been registered
with different SPs, ESPs can be used to acquire data easily.
ESPs communicate with multiple SPs regarding sensor
data acquisition on behalf of the sensor data consumer.
The ESPs depend on the payments (e.g. commission)

Figure 4. Sensor classiﬁcation scheme based on ownership

The same process will occur when physical properties
(e.g. land, building) are sold from one party to another.
This category would be the second largest sensor owner
after the personal and household category.

• The public organizations and places category is similar
to the private organizations and places category we
discussed above. However, this category also includes
public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, parks,
etc. All the sensors deployed by the government will
be published in the cloud depending on government
policies.

• Commercial sensor data providers are business entities
who deploy and manage sensors by themselves by
keeping ownership. They earn by publishing the sensors
and sensor data they own through sensor publishers.
They may deploy sensors across all places such
as households, private and public owned properties
depending on demand and strategic value by also
complying with legal terms. Mostly, they will focus
on public and private places. They will also make a
payment to the property owner as an exchange for
giving permissions for sensor deployment. For example,
commercial sensor data provider may deploy sensors
in a children’s park owned by state government (under
government permission) to detect motion and measure
the micro climate (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
speed, wind direction). Such monitoring allows to
detect and predict potential crowd movements. The
sensor data that can be used to predict such movements
can be sold to sensor data consumers such as mobile
stall businesses and children’s product retailers who
may be located in nearby areas.

A sensor owner makes the ﬁnal decision on whether
to publish the sensors he owns in the cloud or not. If the
owner decides not to publish, no sensor publisher would
be able to get access to those sensors which signiﬁcantly
protect the security and privacy of the sensor owner. If the
sensor owner decides to publish the sensors he owns, he
needs to register himself with a sensor publisher. Sensor
owners can deﬁne restrictions and conditions such as who
can request permission and the expected return (offer). It
is important to note that each sensor may send data to
a different SP in the cloud (similar as we use Internet
service providers). However, a single sensor only sends
data to a single SP (in order to save energy). Data will be

ABSTRACT

The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world’s population
thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of
resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efﬁcient city management
has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to ﬁnd
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained signiﬁcant attention over the
past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efﬁcient and effective
resource management in Smart Cities. Today infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it ﬁts with the Internet of
Things. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical, and social
perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues. Copyright c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Smart Cities (SC) [2]
are recent phenomena that have attracted the attention from
both academia and industry. While both ideas consolidate
similar ideology, they have different origins. Both IoT
and SC do not have clear and concise deﬁnitions due to
their short history and broadness. Examining the origins of
both ideas in brief allows us to understand their potentials.
Even though the term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined
in 1999 [3], the technologies that enable IoT such as
sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in

we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

[25] to the sensor data consumers. However, in some
instances a single business entity can perform both sensor
publisher and extended service provider roles. Each SP
has access (only) to the sensors which are registered with
it. When a sensor data consumer needs sensor data from
multiple sensors where each sensor has been registered
with different SPs, ESPs can be used to acquire data easily.
ESPs communicate with multiple SPs regarding sensor
data acquisition on behalf of the sensor data consumer.
The ESPs depend on the payments (e.g. commission)

The same process will occur when physical properties
(e.g. land, building) are sold from one party to another.
This category would be the second largest sensor owner
after the personal and household category.

• The public organizations and places category is similar
to the private organizations and places category we
discussed above. However, this category also includes
public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, parks,
etc. All the sensors deployed by the government will
be published in the cloud depending on government
policies.

• Commercial sensor data providers are business entities
who deploy and manage sensors by themselves by
keeping ownership. They earn by publishing the sensors
and sensor data they own through sensor publishers.
They may deploy sensors across all places such
as households, private and public owned properties
depending on demand and strategic value by also
complying with legal terms. Mostly, they will focus
on public and private places. They will also make a
payment to the property owner as an exchange for
giving permissions for sensor deployment. For example,
commercial sensor data provider may deploy sensors
in a children’s park owned by state government (under
government permission) to detect motion and measure
the micro climate (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
speed, wind direction). Such monitoring allows to
detect and predict potential crowd movements. The
sensor data that can be used to predict such movements
can be sold to sensor data consumers such as mobile
stall businesses and children’s product retailers who
may be located in nearby areas.

A sensor owner makes the ﬁnal decision on whether
to publish the sensors he owns in the cloud or not. If the
owner decides not to publish, no sensor publisher would
be able to get access to those sensors which signiﬁcantly
protect the security and privacy of the sensor owner. If the
sensor owner decides to publish the sensors he owns, he
needs to register himself with a sensor publisher. Sensor
owners can deﬁne restrictions and conditions such as who
can request permission and the expected return (offer). It
is important to note that each sensor may send data to
a different SP in the cloud (similar as we use Internet
service providers). However, a single sensor only sends
data to a single SP (in order to save energy). Data will be

added service they provided to their customers (i.e. sensor
data consumers). An example value added service can be
selecting sensors based on customer’s requirements [26].
Customers will provide their requirements in high-level
(e.g. measure environmental pollution in Canberra) instead
of selecting the sensors by themselves. In return, ESP
will select the appropriate sensors (e.g. pH, temperature,
humidity, CO2, etc.) located in Canberra. Pinto et al. [27]
have proposed an architectural approach for telecoms to
take advantage of machine-to-machine markets in the IoT
domain. It explains the opportunities business can address
by providing services related to connectivity management,
data management, and service provisioning.

Sensor Data Consumers Layer: This layer consists
of sensor data consumers. All the sensor data consumers
need to register themselves and obtain a valid digital
certiﬁcate from an authority in order
to consume
sensor data. Some of the major sensor data consumers
would be governments, business organizations, academic
institutions, and scientiﬁc research communities. Sensor
data consumers do not directly communicate with sensors
or sensor owners. All the communication and transactions
need to be done through either SPs or ESPs. If a sensor
consumer has the required technical capability, they can
directly acquire data from sensor publishers. However,
this could be very challenging. For example, selecting
which sensors to use out of billions of sensors available
could be an overwhelming task [28]. Further, sensor data
consumers may need to communicate with multiple sensor
publishers to acquire the required data. However, the cost
of sensor data acquisition would be lower as they are not
required to pay for ESPs’ value added services. Scientiﬁc
research communities may be interested in such methods.
The sensor consumers with less technical capabilities
and expertise can acquire required sensor data through
ESPs where most of the difﬁcult tasks such as combining
sensor data from multiple sensor publishers and selecting
appropriate sensors based on the consumer requirements
are handled. Further, sensor consumers can register their

interests with both SPs, and ESPs. For example, they can
express their interest by using a number of constraints.
A coffee manufacture who expects to starts its business
in Canberra may be interested to access the sensor data
produced by coffee machines located in Canberra for a
fee. Depending on the expression of interest, ESPs/SPs
will notify the coffee manufacturer when a matching deal
is available. In simple terms, sensor owners deﬁne what
they are expecting as return for the sensor data from one
end of the Sensing as a service model. On the other end,
sensor consumers deﬁne what kind of sensor data they
want and how much are they willing to pay (offer). SPs and
ESPs are platforms that enable these transactions (deals) to
take place. The sensing as a service model shares common
characteristics of an auction [29].

assume that Mike has already registered with the SP in
a previous transaction. Mike is allowed to deﬁne which

ABSTRACT

The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world’s population
thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of
resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efﬁcient city management
has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to ﬁnd
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained signiﬁcant attention over the
past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efﬁcient and effective
resource management in Smart Cities. Today infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it ﬁts with the Internet of
Things. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical, and social
perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues. Copyright c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Smart Cities (SC) [2]
are recent phenomena that have attracted the attention from
both academia and industry. While both ideas consolidate
similar ideology, they have different origins. Both IoT
and SC do not have clear and concise deﬁnitions due to
their short history and broadness. Examining the origins of
both ideas in brief allows us to understand their potentials.
Even though the term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined
in 1999 [3], the technologies that enable IoT such as
sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
we brieﬂy review the trend of everything as service in
Section 2. In Section 3, the sensing as a service model
is presented. Subsequently, we explain the sensing as a
service model using a futuristic scenario in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss several use case scenarios that
highlight the different aspects of the sensing as a service
model. Advantages in sensing as a service model are
discussed in Section 6. Later, in Section 7, we highlight

process inefﬁcient. In XaaS, online retail applications are
hosted in servers facilitated by cloud service provider
where the business is only required to pay for the resource
it consumes. This model works similar to the utility
services such as electricity. Further, cloud computing
service models provide many other beneﬁts such as
business agility, scalability and elasticity, reliability, green
initiatives, less maintenance work including backup and
disaster recovery. Ultimately, XaaS allows businesses to
focus more on core competency and innovation instead of
ICT [14]. Further explanation on characteristics, features
and beneﬁts of cloud computing are presented in [12, 15].
trend
during the past decade. Various city councils, business
organizations, research and academic institutions, and the
governments have invested signiﬁcantly in projects to
study, design, and build solutions to address the problems
in urban cities using ICT. IBM Smart Planet and Smart
Cities, Oracle iGovernment, Amsterdam Smart City, Dubai
SmartCity, EuropeanSmartCities, and Smart Cities Future
are some of the leading Smart City projects [16, 17]. The
following statistics show the magnitude of both trends.
Global cloud computing and XaaS market is expected to
grow from $37.8 billion in 2010 to $121.1 billion by 2015,
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
26.2% from 2010 to 2015 [14]. Similarly, the global Smart
City market is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2016,
growing at a CAGR of 14.2% [18].

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in
detail. As depicted in Figure 3, the sensing as a service
model consists of four conceptual layers: 1) sensors and
sensor owners, 2) sensor publishers, 3) extended service
providers, and 4) sensor data consumers. In this section,
we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic
conceptual form. In Section 4, we present a real world
scenario based on this model. At the end of Section 4, we
map the real world scenario into the conceptual model in
order to provide a practical understanding.

Sensors and Sensor Owners Layer: This layer
consists of sensors and sensor owners. A sensor is a device
that detects, measures or sense a physical phenomenon
such as humidity, temperature, etc. [19]. Multiple sensors
can be attached to an object or device. For example,
microwaves or coffee machines may have sensors that
can be used to detect events (e.g. the number of times
it is used per day and related context information). Such

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

information can be used to understand user behaviour and
user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

shared between SPs if necessary depending on consumer
requirements. Even though all four categories perfom the
same task (i.e. sensor deployment and publication), the
decision making processes can be quite different especially
in term of objectives, ﬁnancial goals, approval processes,
privacy and policy concerns.

Sensor Publishers Layer: This layer consists of sensor
publishers (SP). The main responsibility of a sensor
publisher is to detect available sensors, communicate
with the sensor owners, and get permission to publish
the sensors in the cloud. Sensor publishers are separate
business entities. When a sensor owner
registers a
speciﬁc sensor, SP collects information about the sensor
availability, owner preferences and restriction, expected
return, etc. All this information needs to be published in
the cloud. Once the registration is done, a SP waits until
a sensor consumer makes a request. When a SP receives
such a request, it forwards all the details including the offer
to the corresponding sensor owner(s) to accept or reject.
If the sensor owner accepts the offer, the corresponding
sensor data consumer will be able to acquire data from
that sensor through the SP during the period mentioned
in the agreement (offer). The same interaction explained
above can take place between SPs and ESPs. SPs entirely
depend on the payments (e.g. commission) receives from
sensor owners, sensor data consumers or both. Xively
[22] is a public cloud for the IoT that simpliﬁes and
accelerates the creation, deployment, and management,
of sensors in scalable manner. Further, it allows sharing
sensor data with each other though it is far away from being
qualiﬁed as a SP we envisioned in the sensing as a service
model. The OpenIoT project [23] focuses on providing an
open source middleware framework enabling the dynamic
formulation of self-managed cloud environments for IoT
applications. Global Sensor Networks (GSN) [24] is a
middleware which supports sensor deployments and offers
a ﬂexible, zero-programming deployment and integration
infrastructure for IoT. These approaches strengthen our
vision towards sensing as a service.

Extended Service Providers Layer: This

layer
consists of extended service providers (ESP). This layer
can be considered as the most intelligent among all the
four layers which embed the intelligence to the entire
service model. The services provided by ESPs can be
varied widely from one provider to another. However,
there are some fundamental characteristics of ESPs. To
become an ESP, they have to provide value added services
[25] to the sensor data consumers. However, in some
instances a single business entity can perform both sensor
publisher and extended service provider roles. Each SP
has access (only) to the sensors which are registered with
it. When a sensor data consumer needs sensor data from
multiple sensors where each sensor has been registered
with different SPs, ESPs can be used to acquire data easily.
ESPs communicate with multiple SPs regarding sensor
data acquisition on behalf of the sensor data consumer.
The ESPs depend on the payments (e.g. commission)

explained the sensing as a service model in a generic
perspective and now we describe it from the above
mentioned scenario perspective. In the scenario, Mike

communication and transactions between Mike and the

GoldenCheese has hired ProductiveAnalytics to perform
the data analysis as they do not have the required technical
skills within the company. ProductiveAnalytics collects the
data by handling all the deals and transaction with the
sensor owners though their partner SPs.

5. SENSING AS A SERVICE IN ACTION

In the previous section, we discussed a scenario related to
the smart home domain in sensing as a service perspective.
This section presents three different use case scenarios
that explain different aspects of the sensing as a service
model: (1) waste management, (2) smart agriculture, and
(3) environmental management. All three scenarios share
common a sets of characteristics as well as few unique
characteristics. Waste management has a direct impact on
cities. Environmental management has direct, indirect, and
long term impact on the entire human life-cycle both in
urban and rural living. Further, smart agriculture makes
indirect impact on sustainability towards the smart cities.

5.1. Waste Management

Waste management is one of the toughest challenge that
modern cities have to deal with. Waste management
consists of different processes such as collection, transport,
processing, disposal, managing, and monitoring of waste
materials. These processes cost signiﬁcant amount of
money, time, and labour. Optimizing waste management
processes help to save money that can be used to address
other challenges that smart cities need to deal with. In
Figure 6, we illustrate how the sensing as a service model
works in the waste management domain. In a modern
smart city, there are several parties who are interested in
waste management (e.g. city council, recycling companies,
manufacturing plants, and authorities related to health
and safety). Instead of deploying sensors and collecting
information independently, the sensing as a service model
allows all the interest groups to share the infrastructure
and bare the related costs collectively. The most important
aspect of such a collaboration is the cost reduction
that individual groups need to spend otherwise. All the
interested parties can retrieve and process sensor data in
real time in order to achieve their own objective. The cost
depends on the data requirement of the interest group.

ABSTRACT

The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world’s population
thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of
resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efﬁcient city management
has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to ﬁnd
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained signiﬁcant attention over the
past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efﬁcient and effective
resource management in Smart Cities. Today infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it ﬁts with the Internet of
Things. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical, and social
perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues. Copyright c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Smart Cities (SC) [2]
are recent phenomena that have attracted the attention from
both academia and industry. While both ideas consolidate
similar ideology, they have different origins. Both IoT
and SC do not have clear and concise deﬁnitions due to
their short history and broadness. Examining the origins of
both ideas in brief allows us to understand their potentials.
Even though the term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined
in 1999 [3], the technologies that enable IoT such as
sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
we brieﬂy review the trend of everything as service in
Section 2. In Section 3, the sensing as a service model
is presented. Subsequently, we explain the sensing as a
service model using a futuristic scenario in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss several use case scenarios that
highlight the different aspects of the sensing as a service
model. Advantages in sensing as a service model are
discussed in Section 6. Later, in Section 7, we highlight

process inefﬁcient. In XaaS, online retail applications are
hosted in servers facilitated by cloud service provider
where the business is only required to pay for the resource
it consumes. This model works similar to the utility
services such as electricity. Further, cloud computing
service models provide many other beneﬁts such as
business agility, scalability and elasticity, reliability, green
initiatives, less maintenance work including backup and
disaster recovery. Ultimately, XaaS allows businesses to
focus more on core competency and innovation instead of
ICT [14]. Further explanation on characteristics, features
and beneﬁts of cloud computing are presented in [12, 15].
trend
during the past decade. Various city councils, business
organizations, research and academic institutions, and the
governments have invested signiﬁcantly in projects to
study, design, and build solutions to address the problems
in urban cities using ICT. IBM Smart Planet and Smart
Cities, Oracle iGovernment, Amsterdam Smart City, Dubai
SmartCity, EuropeanSmartCities, and Smart Cities Future
are some of the leading Smart City projects [16, 17]. The
following statistics show the magnitude of both trends.
Global cloud computing and XaaS market is expected to
grow from $37.8 billion in 2010 to $121.1 billion by 2015,
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
26.2% from 2010 to 2015 [14]. Similarly, the global Smart
City market is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2016,
growing at a CAGR of 14.2% [18].

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in
detail. As depicted in Figure 3, the sensing as a service
model consists of four conceptual layers: 1) sensors and
sensor owners, 2) sensor publishers, 3) extended service
providers, and 4) sensor data consumers. In this section,
we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic
conceptual form. In Section 4, we present a real world
scenario based on this model. At the end of Section 4, we
map the real world scenario into the conceptual model in
order to provide a practical understanding.

Sensors and Sensor Owners Layer: This layer
consists of sensors and sensor owners. A sensor is a device
that detects, measures or sense a physical phenomenon
such as humidity, temperature, etc. [19]. Multiple sensors
can be attached to an object or device. For example,
microwaves or coffee machines may have sensors that
can be used to detect events (e.g. the number of times
it is used per day and related context information). Such

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

information can be used to understand user behaviour and
user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

shared between SPs if necessary depending on consumer
requirements. Even though all four categories perfom the
same task (i.e. sensor deployment and publication), the
decision making processes can be quite different especially
in term of objectives, ﬁnancial goals, approval processes,
privacy and policy concerns.

Sensor Publishers Layer: This layer consists of sensor
publishers (SP). The main responsibility of a sensor
publisher is to detect available sensors, communicate
with the sensor owners, and get permission to publish
the sensors in the cloud. Sensor publishers are separate
business entities. When a sensor owner
registers a
speciﬁc sensor, SP collects information about the sensor
availability, owner preferences and restriction, expected
return, etc. All this information needs to be published in
the cloud. Once the registration is done, a SP waits until
a sensor consumer makes a request. When a SP receives
such a request, it forwards all the details including the offer
to the corresponding sensor owner(s) to accept or reject.
If the sensor owner accepts the offer, the corresponding
sensor data consumer will be able to acquire data from
that sensor through the SP during the period mentioned
in the agreement (offer). The same interaction explained
above can take place between SPs and ESPs. SPs entirely
depend on the payments (e.g. commission) receives from
sensor owners, sensor data consumers or both. Xively
[22] is a public cloud for the IoT that simpliﬁes and
accelerates the creation, deployment, and management,
of sensors in scalable manner. Further, it allows sharing
sensor data with each other though it is far away from being
qualiﬁed as a SP we envisioned in the sensing as a service
model. The OpenIoT project [23] focuses on providing an
open source middleware framework enabling the dynamic
formulation of self-managed cloud environments for IoT
applications. Global Sensor Networks (GSN) [24] is a
middleware which supports sensor deployments and offers
a ﬂexible, zero-programming deployment and integration
infrastructure for IoT. These approaches strengthen our
vision towards sensing as a service.

Extended Service Providers Layer: This

layer
consists of extended service providers (ESP). This layer
can be considered as the most intelligent among all the
four layers which embed the intelligence to the entire
service model. The services provided by ESPs can be
varied widely from one provider to another. However,
there are some fundamental characteristics of ESPs. To
become an ESP, they have to provide value added services
[25] to the sensor data consumers. However, in some
instances a single business entity can perform both sensor
publisher and extended service provider roles. Each SP
has access (only) to the sensors which are registered with
it. When a sensor data consumer needs sensor data from
multiple sensors where each sensor has been registered
with different SPs, ESPs can be used to acquire data easily.
ESPs communicate with multiple SPs regarding sensor
data acquisition on behalf of the sensor data consumer.
The ESPs depend on the payments (e.g. commission)

Figure 4. Sensor classiﬁcation scheme based on ownership

The same process will occur when physical properties
(e.g. land, building) are sold from one party to another.
This category would be the second largest sensor owner
after the personal and household category.

• The public organizations and places category is similar
to the private organizations and places category we
discussed above. However, this category also includes
public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, parks,
etc. All the sensors deployed by the government will
be published in the cloud depending on government
policies.

• Commercial sensor data providers are business entities
who deploy and manage sensors by themselves by
keeping ownership. They earn by publishing the sensors
and sensor data they own through sensor publishers.
They may deploy sensors across all places such
as households, private and public owned properties
depending on demand and strategic value by also
complying with legal terms. Mostly, they will focus
on public and private places. They will also make a
payment to the property owner as an exchange for
giving permissions for sensor deployment. For example,
commercial sensor data provider may deploy sensors
in a children’s park owned by state government (under
government permission) to detect motion and measure
the micro climate (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
speed, wind direction). Such monitoring allows to
detect and predict potential crowd movements. The
sensor data that can be used to predict such movements
can be sold to sensor data consumers such as mobile
stall businesses and children’s product retailers who
may be located in nearby areas.

A sensor owner makes the ﬁnal decision on whether
to publish the sensors he owns in the cloud or not. If the
owner decides not to publish, no sensor publisher would
be able to get access to those sensors which signiﬁcantly
protect the security and privacy of the sensor owner. If the
sensor owner decides to publish the sensors he owns, he
needs to register himself with a sensor publisher. Sensor
owners can deﬁne restrictions and conditions such as who
can request permission and the expected return (offer). It
is important to note that each sensor may send data to
a different SP in the cloud (similar as we use Internet
service providers). However, a single sensor only sends
data to a single SP (in order to save energy). Data will be

Figure 5. A futuristic scenario that explains the interactions in sensing as a service model

similar to SPs. ESPs receive payments for the value
added service they provided to their customers (i.e. sensor
data consumers). An example value added service can be
selecting sensors based on customer’s requirements [26].
Customers will provide their requirements in high-level
(e.g. measure environmental pollution in Canberra) instead
of selecting the sensors by themselves. In return, ESP
will select the appropriate sensors (e.g. pH, temperature,
humidity, CO2, etc.) located in Canberra. Pinto et al. [27]
have proposed an architectural approach for telecoms to
take advantage of machine-to-machine markets in the IoT
domain. It explains the opportunities business can address
by providing services related to connectivity management,
data management, and service provisioning.

Sensor Data Consumers Layer: This layer consists
of sensor data consumers. All the sensor data consumers
need to register themselves and obtain a valid digital
certiﬁcate from an authority in order
to consume
sensor data. Some of the major sensor data consumers
would be governments, business organizations, academic
institutions, and scientiﬁc research communities. Sensor
data consumers do not directly communicate with sensors
or sensor owners. All the communication and transactions
need to be done through either SPs or ESPs. If a sensor
consumer has the required technical capability, they can
directly acquire data from sensor publishers. However,
this could be very challenging. For example, selecting
which sensors to use out of billions of sensors available
could be an overwhelming task [28]. Further, sensor data
consumers may need to communicate with multiple sensor
publishers to acquire the required data. However, the cost
of sensor data acquisition would be lower as they are not
required to pay for ESPs’ value added services. Scientiﬁc
research communities may be interested in such methods.
The sensor consumers with less technical capabilities
and expertise can acquire required sensor data through
ESPs where most of the difﬁcult tasks such as combining
sensor data from multiple sensor publishers and selecting
appropriate sensors based on the consumer requirements
are handled. Further, sensor consumers can register their

Trans. Emerging Tel. Tech. 2014; 00:1–12 c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/ett

interests with both SPs, and ESPs. For example, they can
express their interest by using a number of constraints.
A coffee manufacture who expects to starts its business
in Canberra may be interested to access the sensor data
produced by coffee machines located in Canberra for a
fee. Depending on the expression of interest, ESPs/SPs
will notify the coffee manufacturer when a matching deal
is available. In simple terms, sensor owners deﬁne what
they are expecting as return for the sensor data from one
end of the Sensing as a service model. On the other end,
sensor consumers deﬁne what kind of sensor data they
want and how much are they willing to pay (offer). SPs and
ESPs are platforms that enable these transactions (deals) to
take place. The sensing as a service model shares common
characteristics of an auction [29].

4. THE FUTURE: A SCENARIO

A futuristic scenario can be used to explain the sensing
as a service model. The scenario illustrated in Figure 5 is
based on smart home domain which also plays a signiﬁcant
role in the Smart Cities. Our intention is to highlight the
interactions between different parties explained earlier in
high-level.

Mike bought a new refrigerator for his new home.
He brought it home and plugged it to the power. The
fridge automatically identiﬁes the availability of Wi-Fi in
the house as shown in step (1). Further, the refrigerator
communicates with a sensor publisher and informs about
its presence by providing information such as the available
sensors (e.g. RFID reader, temperature, door sensors) as
shown in step (2). Next, in step (3), the SP communicates
with Mike to check whether he likes to publish the sensors
attached to the refrigerator in the cloud (step 3). We
assume that Mike has already registered with the SP in
a previous transaction. Mike is allowed to deﬁne which
sensors to publish, what kind of consumers are allowed
to bid, and what kind of return (fee or any other offer) is
expected. Later, Mike receives an email from a company

ice cream manufacturer, with an offer as shown in step
(4). DairyIceCream is interested to have access to the
RFID reader and the door sensor attached to the freezer in
Mike’s refrigerator. As a return, DairyIceCream is willing
to offer either 3% discount on every product purchased
from DairyIceCream or a monthly fee of $2. As Mike likes
DairyIceCream products, he agrees to the 3% discount
offer instead of the monthly fee as shown in step (5).
A week later, Mike receives an email from a company
called ProductiveAnalytics which has been sent on behalf
of the GoldenCheese company, a cheese manufacturer,
with an similar offer. This request also comes through
EasySensing. However, the offer is either 4% discount on
every product purchase by GoldenCheese or a monthly fee
of $1. As Mike does not like GoldenCheese products, he
decides to accept the monthly fee option.

Scenario from model perspective: In Section 3, we
explained the sensing as a service model in a generic
perspective and now we describe it from the above
mentioned scenario perspective. In the scenario, Mike
is the sensor owner. Therefore, he and his sensors

in ownership categorization, Mike represents the Personal
and households scheme. Both the DairyIceCream and
GoldenCheese companies
the sensor data
consumers layer. EasySensing is a SP who enables the
communication and transactions between Mike and the
DairyIceCream. EasySensing is responsible for matching
the sensor owners expectations with the requirements of
sensor data consumers. DairyIceCream retrieves the data
from EasySensing directly and conducts the data analysis
with the help of in-house experts. ProductiveAnalytics
is an ESP who works on behalf of GoldenCheese.
GoldenCheese has hired ProductiveAnalytics to perform
the data analysis as they do not have the required technical
skills within the company. ProductiveAnalytics collects the
data by handling all the deals and transaction with the
sensor owners though their partner SPs.

5. SENSING AS A SERVICE IN ACTION

In the previous section, we discussed a scenario related to
the smart home domain in sensing as a service perspective.
This section presents three different use case scenarios
that explain different aspects of the sensing as a service
model: (1) waste management, (2) smart agriculture, and
(3) environmental management. All three scenarios share
common a sets of characteristics as well as few unique
characteristics. Waste management has a direct impact on
cities. Environmental management has direct, indirect, and
long term impact on the entire human life-cycle both in
urban and rural living. Further, smart agriculture makes
indirect impact on sustainability towards the smart cities.

5.1. Waste Management

Waste management is one of the toughest challenge that
modern cities have to deal with. Waste management
consists of different processes such as collection, transport,
processing, disposal, managing, and monitoring of waste
materials. These processes cost signiﬁcant amount of
money, time, and labour. Optimizing waste management
processes help to save money that can be used to address
other challenges that smart cities need to deal with. In
Figure 6, we illustrate how the sensing as a service model
works in the waste management domain. In a modern
smart city, there are several parties who are interested in
waste management (e.g. city council, recycling companies,
manufacturing plants, and authorities related to health
and safety). Instead of deploying sensors and collecting
information independently, the sensing as a service model
allows all the interest groups to share the infrastructure
and bare the related costs collectively. The most important
aspect of such a collaboration is the cost reduction
that individual groups need to spend otherwise. All the
interested parties can retrieve and process sensor data in
real time in order to achieve their own objective. The cost
depends on the data requirement of the interest group.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

For example, a city council may use sensor data to
develop optimized garbage collection strategies, so they
can save fuel cost related to garbage trucks. Additionally,
recycling companies can use sensor data to predict and
track the amount of waste coming into their plants to be
processed so they can optimize their internal processes.
Further, health and safety authorities can monitor and
supervise the waste management process without spending
substantial amount of money for manual monitoring
inspections. The phenomenon of sharing sensor data using
a sensing as a service model creates a synergy effect (i.e.
interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce
an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects).
The sensing as a service model ensures the long term
sustainability of the IoT infrastructure.

the sensing as a service model

Let us discuss how this technology can be used to
support
in ﬁnancially
viable manner. In order to perform waste management,
different types of sensors need to be deployed in different
places such as garbage cans and trucks. These sensors
need to detect information such as the amount of garbage,
types of garbage, and so on. As we have depicted in
Figure 6, direct and indirect communication strategies
can be used to collect and communicate sensor data to
the cloud. Sensors with energy harvesting capabilities
are important
in this domain [30]. As represented in
step (1) in Figure 6, low powered [31] and low capable
sensors can be used to sense and data can be uploaded
to the cloud with the help of nearby infrastructure (e.g.
through communication devices attached to street lights
or similar infrastructure that have access to rich energy
sources and communication capabilities). Additionally,
when long range communication is not available, data can
be uploaded to the cloud with the help of auto-mobiles, as
depicted in step (2) in Figure 6, such as garbage trucks,
city council vehicles, buses that operate in the areas and
so on. Furthermore, both active and passive sensors can be
used to sense the environment [32]. Direct communication
can be done via technologies such as 3G which makes this
approach less dependant on third parties (as depicted in (3)
in Figure 6).

5.2. Smart Agriculture

Currently, the authors are actively involved in designing
and developing open platforms for sensor data collection,
processing and sharing in the domain of agriculture
through two projects: Phenonet [33] and OpenIoT [23].
In this scenario, the general public is not directly involved
as in the smart home domain. In Figure 7, we illustrate
how the sensing as a service model works in the smart
agriculture domain. Agriculture is an importation part of
smart cities as it contributes to the food supply-chain that
facilitates a large number of communities concentrated
into cities.

The sensing as a service model allows to conduct
scientiﬁc research and exploration more efﬁciently
and efﬁciently. Further, it opens up different research

opportunities which are unlikely to occurr in a traditional
research model. Let us explain the Phenonet project in
details and the applicability of the sensing as a service
model towards agricultural research. Phenonet describes
the network of sensors collecting information over a
ﬁeld of experimental crops. Researchers at
the High
Resolution Plant Phenomics Centre are testing a network
of smart sensor nodes able to monitor plant growth and
performance information and climate conditions. Even
though the main research goal of deploying sensors
and collecting data is to understand plant growth under
different climate conditions,
the same set of sensors
can be utilized to perform a verity of different research
activities in different domains. The data can be shared
among different research organizations and institutions
located around the world. Due to limited funding, most
of these research institutions may not be able to maintain
large scale sensor deployments (e.g. academic institutions,
specially in developing countries). However, the sensing
as a service model allows all these interest groups, who
are unable to set-up their own sensor deployments, to
perform research using actual data with signiﬁcantly less
costs. Further, the sensing as a service model creates

ABSTRACT

The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world’s population
thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of
resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efﬁcient city management
has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to ﬁnd
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained signiﬁcant attention over the
past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efﬁcient and effective
resource management in Smart Cities. Today infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it ﬁts with the Internet of
Things. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical, and social
perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues. Copyright c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Smart Cities (SC) [2]
are recent phenomena that have attracted the attention from
both academia and industry. While both ideas consolidate
similar ideology, they have different origins. Both IoT
and SC do not have clear and concise deﬁnitions due to
their short history and broadness. Examining the origins of
both ideas in brief allows us to understand their potentials.
Even though the term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined
in 1999 [3], the technologies that enable IoT such as
sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
we brieﬂy review the trend of everything as service in
Section 2. In Section 3, the sensing as a service model
is presented. Subsequently, we explain the sensing as a
service model using a futuristic scenario in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss several use case scenarios that
highlight the different aspects of the sensing as a service
model. Advantages in sensing as a service model are
discussed in Section 6. Later, in Section 7, we highlight

process inefﬁcient. In XaaS, online retail applications are
hosted in servers facilitated by cloud service provider
where the business is only required to pay for the resource
it consumes. This model works similar to the utility
services such as electricity. Further, cloud computing
service models provide many other beneﬁts such as
business agility, scalability and elasticity, reliability, green
initiatives, less maintenance work including backup and
disaster recovery. Ultimately, XaaS allows businesses to
focus more on core competency and innovation instead of
ICT [14]. Further explanation on characteristics, features
and beneﬁts of cloud computing are presented in [12, 15].
trend
during the past decade. Various city councils, business
organizations, research and academic institutions, and the
governments have invested signiﬁcantly in projects to
study, design, and build solutions to address the problems
in urban cities using ICT. IBM Smart Planet and Smart
Cities, Oracle iGovernment, Amsterdam Smart City, Dubai
SmartCity, EuropeanSmartCities, and Smart Cities Future
are some of the leading Smart City projects [16, 17]. The
following statistics show the magnitude of both trends.
Global cloud computing and XaaS market is expected to
grow from $37.8 billion in 2010 to $121.1 billion by 2015,
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
26.2% from 2010 to 2015 [14]. Similarly, the global Smart
City market is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2016,
growing at a CAGR of 14.2% [18].

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in
detail. As depicted in Figure 3, the sensing as a service
model consists of four conceptual layers: 1) sensors and
sensor owners, 2) sensor publishers, 3) extended service
providers, and 4) sensor data consumers. In this section,
we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic
conceptual form. In Section 4, we present a real world
scenario based on this model. At the end of Section 4, we
map the real world scenario into the conceptual model in
order to provide a practical understanding.

Sensors and Sensor Owners Layer: This layer
consists of sensors and sensor owners. A sensor is a device
that detects, measures or sense a physical phenomenon
such as humidity, temperature, etc. [19]. Multiple sensors
can be attached to an object or device. For example,
microwaves or coffee machines may have sensors that
can be used to detect events (e.g. the number of times
it is used per day and related context information). Such

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

information can be used to understand user behaviour and
user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

shared between SPs if necessary depending on consumer
requirements. Even though all four categories perfom the
same task (i.e. sensor deployment and publication), the
decision making processes can be quite different especially
in term of objectives, ﬁnancial goals, approval processes,
privacy and policy concerns.

Sensor Publishers Layer: This layer consists of sensor
publishers (SP). The main responsibility of a sensor
publisher is to detect available sensors, communicate
with the sensor owners, and get permission to publish
the sensors in the cloud. Sensor publishers are separate
business entities. When a sensor owner
registers a
speciﬁc sensor, SP collects information about the sensor
availability, owner preferences and restriction, expected
return, etc. All this information needs to be published in
the cloud. Once the registration is done, a SP waits until
a sensor consumer makes a request. When a SP receives
such a request, it forwards all the details including the offer
to the corresponding sensor owner(s) to accept or reject.
If the sensor owner accepts the offer, the corresponding
sensor data consumer will be able to acquire data from
that sensor through the SP during the period mentioned
in the agreement (offer). The same interaction explained
above can take place between SPs and ESPs. SPs entirely
depend on the payments (e.g. commission) receives from
sensor owners, sensor data consumers or both. Xively
[22] is a public cloud for the IoT that simpliﬁes and
accelerates the creation, deployment, and management,
of sensors in scalable manner. Further, it allows sharing
sensor data with each other though it is far away from being
qualiﬁed as a SP we envisioned in the sensing as a service
model. The OpenIoT project [23] focuses on providing an
open source middleware framework enabling the dynamic
formulation of self-managed cloud environments for IoT
applications. Global Sensor Networks (GSN) [24] is a
middleware which supports sensor deployments and offers
a ﬂexible, zero-programming deployment and integration
infrastructure for IoT. These approaches strengthen our
vision towards sensing as a service.

Extended Service Providers Layer: This

layer
consists of extended service providers (ESP). This layer
can be considered as the most intelligent among all the
four layers which embed the intelligence to the entire
service model. The services provided by ESPs can be
varied widely from one provider to another. However,
there are some fundamental characteristics of ESPs. To
become an ESP, they have to provide value added services
[25] to the sensor data consumers. However, in some
instances a single business entity can perform both sensor
publisher and extended service provider roles. Each SP
has access (only) to the sensors which are registered with
it. When a sensor data consumer needs sensor data from
multiple sensors where each sensor has been registered
with different SPs, ESPs can be used to acquire data easily.
ESPs communicate with multiple SPs regarding sensor
data acquisition on behalf of the sensor data consumer.
The ESPs depend on the payments (e.g. commission)

Figure 4. Sensor classiﬁcation scheme based on ownership

The same process will occur when physical properties
(e.g. land, building) are sold from one party to another.
This category would be the second largest sensor owner
after the personal and household category.

• The public organizations and places category is similar
to the private organizations and places category we
discussed above. However, this category also includes
public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, parks,
etc. All the sensors deployed by the government will
be published in the cloud depending on government
policies.

• Commercial sensor data providers are business entities
who deploy and manage sensors by themselves by
keeping ownership. They earn by publishing the sensors
and sensor data they own through sensor publishers.
They may deploy sensors across all places such
as households, private and public owned properties
depending on demand and strategic value by also
complying with legal terms. Mostly, they will focus
on public and private places. They will also make a
payment to the property owner as an exchange for
giving permissions for sensor deployment. For example,
commercial sensor data provider may deploy sensors
in a children’s park owned by state government (under
government permission) to detect motion and measure
the micro climate (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
speed, wind direction). Such monitoring allows to
detect and predict potential crowd movements. The
sensor data that can be used to predict such movements
can be sold to sensor data consumers such as mobile
stall businesses and children’s product retailers who
may be located in nearby areas.

A sensor owner makes the ﬁnal decision on whether
to publish the sensors he owns in the cloud or not. If the
owner decides not to publish, no sensor publisher would
be able to get access to those sensors which signiﬁcantly
protect the security and privacy of the sensor owner. If the
sensor owner decides to publish the sensors he owns, he
needs to register himself with a sensor publisher. Sensor
owners can deﬁne restrictions and conditions such as who
can request permission and the expected return (offer). It
is important to note that each sensor may send data to
a different SP in the cloud (similar as we use Internet
service providers). However, a single sensor only sends
data to a single SP (in order to save energy). Data will be

Figure 5. A futuristic scenario that explains the interactions in sensing as a service model

similar to SPs. ESPs receive payments for the value
added service they provided to their customers (i.e. sensor
data consumers). An example value added service can be
selecting sensors based on customer’s requirements [26].
Customers will provide their requirements in high-level
(e.g. measure environmental pollution in Canberra) instead
of selecting the sensors by themselves. In return, ESP
will select the appropriate sensors (e.g. pH, temperature,
humidity, CO2, etc.) located in Canberra. Pinto et al. [27]
have proposed an architectural approach for telecoms to
take advantage of machine-to-machine markets in the IoT
domain. It explains the opportunities business can address
by providing services related to connectivity management,
data management, and service provisioning.

Sensor Data Consumers Layer: This layer consists
of sensor data consumers. All the sensor data consumers
need to register themselves and obtain a valid digital
certiﬁcate from an authority in order
to consume
sensor data. Some of the major sensor data consumers
would be governments, business organizations, academic
institutions, and scientiﬁc research communities. Sensor
data consumers do not directly communicate with sensors
or sensor owners. All the communication and transactions
need to be done through either SPs or ESPs. If a sensor
consumer has the required technical capability, they can
directly acquire data from sensor publishers. However,
this could be very challenging. For example, selecting
which sensors to use out of billions of sensors available
could be an overwhelming task [28]. Further, sensor data
consumers may need to communicate with multiple sensor
publishers to acquire the required data. However, the cost
of sensor data acquisition would be lower as they are not
required to pay for ESPs’ value added services. Scientiﬁc
research communities may be interested in such methods.
The sensor consumers with less technical capabilities
and expertise can acquire required sensor data through
ESPs where most of the difﬁcult tasks such as combining
sensor data from multiple sensor publishers and selecting
appropriate sensors based on the consumer requirements
are handled. Further, sensor consumers can register their

Trans. Emerging Tel. Tech. 2014; 00:1–12 c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/ett

interests with both SPs, and ESPs. For example, they can
express their interest by using a number of constraints.
A coffee manufacture who expects to starts its business
in Canberra may be interested to access the sensor data
produced by coffee machines located in Canberra for a
fee. Depending on the expression of interest, ESPs/SPs
will notify the coffee manufacturer when a matching deal
is available. In simple terms, sensor owners deﬁne what
they are expecting as return for the sensor data from one
end of the Sensing as a service model. On the other end,
sensor consumers deﬁne what kind of sensor data they
want and how much are they willing to pay (offer). SPs and
ESPs are platforms that enable these transactions (deals) to
take place. The sensing as a service model shares common
characteristics of an auction [29].

4. THE FUTURE: A SCENARIO

A futuristic scenario can be used to explain the sensing
as a service model. The scenario illustrated in Figure 5 is
based on smart home domain which also plays a signiﬁcant
role in the Smart Cities. Our intention is to highlight the
interactions between different parties explained earlier in
high-level.

Mike bought a new refrigerator for his new home.
He brought it home and plugged it to the power. The
fridge automatically identiﬁes the availability of Wi-Fi in
the house as shown in step (1). Further, the refrigerator
communicates with a sensor publisher and informs about
its presence by providing information such as the available
sensors (e.g. RFID reader, temperature, door sensors) as
shown in step (2). Next, in step (3), the SP communicates
with Mike to check whether he likes to publish the sensors
attached to the refrigerator in the cloud (step 3). We
assume that Mike has already registered with the SP in
a previous transaction. Mike is allowed to deﬁne which
sensors to publish, what kind of consumers are allowed
to bid, and what kind of return (fee or any other offer) is
expected. Later, Mike receives an email from a company

ice cream manufacturer, with an offer as shown in step
(4). DairyIceCream is interested to have access to the
RFID reader and the door sensor attached to the freezer in
Mike’s refrigerator. As a return, DairyIceCream is willing
to offer either 3% discount on every product purchased
from DairyIceCream or a monthly fee of $2. As Mike likes
DairyIceCream products, he agrees to the 3% discount
offer instead of the monthly fee as shown in step (5).
A week later, Mike receives an email from a company
called ProductiveAnalytics which has been sent on behalf
of the GoldenCheese company, a cheese manufacturer,
with an similar offer. This request also comes through
EasySensing. However, the offer is either 4% discount on
every product purchase by GoldenCheese or a monthly fee
of $1. As Mike does not like GoldenCheese products, he
decides to accept the monthly fee option.

Scenario from model perspective: In Section 3, we
explained the sensing as a service model in a generic
perspective and now we describe it from the above
mentioned scenario perspective. In the scenario, Mike
is the sensor owner. Therefore, he and his sensors
represent the sensors and sensor owners layer. Further,
in ownership categorization, Mike represents the Personal
and households scheme. Both the DairyIceCream and
GoldenCheese companies
the sensor data
consumers layer. EasySensing is a SP who enables the
communication and transactions between Mike and the
DairyIceCream. EasySensing is responsible for matching
the sensor owners expectations with the requirements of
sensor data consumers. DairyIceCream retrieves the data
from EasySensing directly and conducts the data analysis
with the help of in-house experts. ProductiveAnalytics
is an ESP who works on behalf of GoldenCheese.
GoldenCheese has hired ProductiveAnalytics to perform
the data analysis as they do not have the required technical
skills within the company. ProductiveAnalytics collects the
data by handling all the deals and transaction with the
sensor owners though their partner SPs.

5. SENSING AS A SERVICE IN ACTION

In the previous section, we discussed a scenario related to
the smart home domain in sensing as a service perspective.
This section presents three different use case scenarios
that explain different aspects of the sensing as a service
model: (1) waste management, (2) smart agriculture, and
(3) environmental management. All three scenarios share
common a sets of characteristics as well as few unique
characteristics. Waste management has a direct impact on
cities. Environmental management has direct, indirect, and
long term impact on the entire human life-cycle both in
urban and rural living. Further, smart agriculture makes
indirect impact on sustainability towards the smart cities.

5.1. Waste Management

Waste management is one of the toughest challenge that
modern cities have to deal with. Waste management
consists of different processes such as collection, transport,
processing, disposal, managing, and monitoring of waste
materials. These processes cost signiﬁcant amount of
money, time, and labour. Optimizing waste management
processes help to save money that can be used to address
other challenges that smart cities need to deal with. In
Figure 6, we illustrate how the sensing as a service model
works in the waste management domain. In a modern
smart city, there are several parties who are interested in
waste management (e.g. city council, recycling companies,
manufacturing plants, and authorities related to health
and safety). Instead of deploying sensors and collecting
information independently, the sensing as a service model
allows all the interest groups to share the infrastructure
and bare the related costs collectively. The most important
aspect of such a collaboration is the cost reduction
that individual groups need to spend otherwise. All the
interested parties can retrieve and process sensor data in
real time in order to achieve their own objective. The cost
depends on the data requirement of the interest group.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

For example, a city council may use sensor data to
develop optimized garbage collection strategies, so they
can save fuel cost related to garbage trucks. Additionally,
recycling companies can use sensor data to predict and
track the amount of waste coming into their plants to be
processed so they can optimize their internal processes.
Further, health and safety authorities can monitor and
supervise the waste management process without spending
substantial amount of money for manual monitoring
inspections. The phenomenon of sharing sensor data using
a sensing as a service model creates a synergy effect (i.e.
interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce
an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects).
The sensing as a service model ensures the long term
sustainability of the IoT infrastructure.

the sensing as a service model

Let us discuss how this technology can be used to
support
in ﬁnancially
viable manner. In order to perform waste management,
different types of sensors need to be deployed in different
places such as garbage cans and trucks. These sensors
need to detect information such as the amount of garbage,
types of garbage, and so on. As we have depicted in
Figure 6, direct and indirect communication strategies
can be used to collect and communicate sensor data to
the cloud. Sensors with energy harvesting capabilities
are important
in this domain [30]. As represented in
step (1) in Figure 6, low powered [31] and low capable
sensors can be used to sense and data can be uploaded
to the cloud with the help of nearby infrastructure (e.g.
through communication devices attached to street lights
or similar infrastructure that have access to rich energy
sources and communication capabilities). Additionally,
when long range communication is not available, data can
be uploaded to the cloud with the help of auto-mobiles, as
depicted in step (2) in Figure 6, such as garbage trucks,
city council vehicles, buses that operate in the areas and
so on. Furthermore, both active and passive sensors can be
used to sense the environment [32]. Direct communication
can be done via technologies such as 3G which makes this
approach less dependant on third parties (as depicted in (3)
in Figure 6).

5.2. Smart Agriculture

Currently, the authors are actively involved in designing
and developing open platforms for sensor data collection,
processing and sharing in the domain of agriculture
through two projects: Phenonet [33] and OpenIoT [23].
In this scenario, the general public is not directly involved
as in the smart home domain. In Figure 7, we illustrate
how the sensing as a service model works in the smart
agriculture domain. Agriculture is an importation part of
smart cities as it contributes to the food supply-chain that
facilitates a large number of communities concentrated
into cities.

The sensing as a service model allows to conduct
scientiﬁc research and exploration more efﬁciently
and efﬁciently. Further, it opens up different research

opportunities which are unlikely to occurr in a traditional
research model. Let us explain the Phenonet project in
details and the applicability of the sensing as a service
model towards agricultural research. Phenonet describes
the network of sensors collecting information over a
ﬁeld of experimental crops. Researchers at
the High
Resolution Plant Phenomics Centre are testing a network
of smart sensor nodes able to monitor plant growth and
performance information and climate conditions. Even
though the main research goal of deploying sensors
and collecting data is to understand plant growth under
different climate conditions,
the same set of sensors
can be utilized to perform a verity of different research
activities in different domains. The data can be shared
among different research organizations and institutions
located around the world. Due to limited funding, most
of these research institutions may not be able to maintain
large scale sensor deployments (e.g. academic institutions,
specially in developing countries). However, the sensing
as a service model allows all these interest groups, who
are unable to set-up their own sensor deployments, to
perform research using actual data with signiﬁcantly less
costs. Further, the sensing as a service model creates

opportunities across different domains. For example, the
above mentioned sensor data can be used to understand
pest control and related phenomenon. Additionally they
can be used to understand soil conditions where bio-
scientist may be interested. More importantly, the sensing
as a service model allows researchers to share resources
across borders and understand phenomenon which are not
available in their own countries.

5.3. Environmental Management

This domain has the unique ability of utilizing existing
sensors that are deployed for different reasons. Most
of the sensors used in environmental monitoring are
commonly used in other domains such as climate, wild
ﬁre detection, and structural health monitoring. Using
the sensing as a service model,
interest groups can
acquire relevant sensor data without deploying sensors by
themselves. Further, environmental management is a large
domain where a single organization cannot deal with (e.g.
wild ﬁre). A model like sensing as a service stimulates
innovative solutions that use the same data but produce
different results using different processing and analysing
techniques (e.g. prediction, visualization, simulation). As
we discussed in Section 3, ESPs can help the sensor data
consumers to orchestrate existing services into different
data processing [34] and analysis work-ﬂows [35].

6. ADVANTAGES AND BENEFITS

Some of the major advantages and beneﬁts in the sensing
as a service model are discussed below:
• Built-in cloud computing: It is modelled around cloud
computing. Therefore, it inherits all the beneﬁts of
the fundamental cloud computing models such as
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Scalable and widely accessible
processing and storage resources are available to
facilitate sensing as a service software platforms (SPs
and ESPs). Sensor data consumers only need to pay for
the data they use. Therefore, the cost of data acquisition
reduces signiﬁcantly due to sharing, participatory /
crowd sourcing, and reusing nature (i.e. sense once and
use by many).

• Participatory sensing: The workload is distributed
among different players in the model. This enables
rapid deployment of sensors across wider geographical
locations that capture various phenomena.

• Sharing and reusing: In traditional methods, each party
(group or person) who wants to collect sensor data
needs to visit the ﬁeld and deploy the sensors manually
by themselves. Further, there is no easy way to share
sensor data collected by one party with others. Sensing
as a service is a model that stimulates by concept
of sharing. In simple terms, if someone has already
deployed the sensors, others can have access to them

8

by paying a fee to the sensor owner. One of the
major arguments that could arise regarding sensing as a
service model is that “How to convince a manufacturer
to embed sensors and communication capabilities into
devices we use in everyday life (e.g refrigerator in the
use-case presented in Section 4)”. This question can be
answered in two different perspectives.
First, IoT envisions to have sensor embedded into
objects around us. The goal of IoT is to allow devices
to communicate with each other. Naturally, such a goal
forces next generation devices to be embedded with rich
sensing and communication capabilities. Therefore,
the motivation is given to the manufacturers not by
the sensing as a service model but
the vision of
IoT. The sensing as a service model is designed to
provide incentives to users which motivate them to
purchase next generation devices that supports both
IoT envisioned interactions as well as the sensing as a
service model. The additional cost that contributes to
increase the prices of the devices (due to embedding
rich sensing and communication capabilities) can be
easily covered by participating in the sensing as a
service model
itself. Even today, state of the art
devices such as refrigerators and televisions comprise
communication and sensing capabilities.

• Reduction of data acquisition cost: Due to the shared
and collaborative nature, data acquisition cost will
be reduced signiﬁcantly. Such a sustainable business
model stimulates more and more sensor deployments.
Further, technological advances and higher demands
allow to produce sensors in mass volumes using cheap
materials by reducing the cost per unit. Further, this
helps to collect data from sensors which was impossible
previously.

• Collect data previously unavailable: This model allows
to collect sensor data which is impossible to collect
using traditional non-collaborative methods. This
business model promotes and stimulates the sensor
deployments by companies at commercial level. As
we explained earlier in Section 3, dedicated business
entities will deploy sensors in public places such
as parks and bridges so government authorities can
have access to those sensors by paying only for
the data they need in real-time or archived. Today
business entities spend substantial amount of money
to conduct market analyses and consumer surveys.
A sample of 1,000 respondents, which would give a
statistical accuracy of +/-3.1% costs around $8,000
[36]. Recently, different third party companies started
offering consumer surveys on behalf of businesses.
One such solution is Google Consumer Surveys
(www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys). Google
Consumer Surveys allows businesses to target user
groups with speciﬁc criteria and conduct the survey.
Currently, one user response cost around $0.10, 1/10th
of the cost of similar quality research conduct using
traditional methods.

ABSTRACT

The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world’s population
thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of
resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efﬁcient city management
has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to ﬁnd
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained signiﬁcant attention over the
past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efﬁcient and effective
resource management in Smart Cities. Today infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it ﬁts with the Internet of
Things. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical, and social
perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues. Copyright c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Smart Cities (SC) [2]
are recent phenomena that have attracted the attention from
both academia and industry. While both ideas consolidate
similar ideology, they have different origins. Both IoT
and SC do not have clear and concise deﬁnitions due to
their short history and broadness. Examining the origins of
both ideas in brief allows us to understand their potentials.
Even though the term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined
in 1999 [3], the technologies that enable IoT such as
sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
we brieﬂy review the trend of everything as service in
Section 2. In Section 3, the sensing as a service model
is presented. Subsequently, we explain the sensing as a
service model using a futuristic scenario in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss several use case scenarios that
highlight the different aspects of the sensing as a service
model. Advantages in sensing as a service model are
discussed in Section 6. Later, in Section 7, we highlight

Smart City initiatives have become another

process inefﬁcient. In XaaS, online retail applications are
hosted in servers facilitated by cloud service provider
where the business is only required to pay for the resource
it consumes. This model works similar to the utility
services such as electricity. Further, cloud computing
service models provide many other beneﬁts such as
business agility, scalability and elasticity, reliability, green
initiatives, less maintenance work including backup and
disaster recovery. Ultimately, XaaS allows businesses to
focus more on core competency and innovation instead of
ICT [14]. Further explanation on characteristics, features
and beneﬁts of cloud computing are presented in [12, 15].
trend
during the past decade. Various city councils, business
organizations, research and academic institutions, and the
governments have invested signiﬁcantly in projects to
study, design, and build solutions to address the problems
in urban cities using ICT. IBM Smart Planet and Smart
Cities, Oracle iGovernment, Amsterdam Smart City, Dubai
SmartCity, EuropeanSmartCities, and Smart Cities Future
are some of the leading Smart City projects [16, 17]. The
following statistics show the magnitude of both trends.
Global cloud computing and XaaS market is expected to
grow from $37.8 billion in 2010 to $121.1 billion by 2015,
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
26.2% from 2010 to 2015 [14]. Similarly, the global Smart
City market is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2016,
growing at a CAGR of 14.2% [18].

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in
detail. As depicted in Figure 3, the sensing as a service
model consists of four conceptual layers: 1) sensors and
sensor owners, 2) sensor publishers, 3) extended service
providers, and 4) sensor data consumers. In this section,
we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic
conceptual form. In Section 4, we present a real world
scenario based on this model. At the end of Section 4, we
map the real world scenario into the conceptual model in
order to provide a practical understanding.

Sensors and Sensor Owners Layer: This layer
consists of sensors and sensor owners. A sensor is a device
that detects, measures or sense a physical phenomenon
such as humidity, temperature, etc. [19]. Multiple sensors
can be attached to an object or device. For example,
microwaves or coffee machines may have sensors that
can be used to detect events (e.g. the number of times
it is used per day and related context information). Such

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

information can be used to understand user behaviour and
user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

shared between SPs if necessary depending on consumer
requirements. Even though all four categories perfom the
same task (i.e. sensor deployment and publication), the
decision making processes can be quite different especially
in term of objectives, ﬁnancial goals, approval processes,
privacy and policy concerns.

Sensor Publishers Layer: This layer consists of sensor
publishers (SP). The main responsibility of a sensor
publisher is to detect available sensors, communicate
with the sensor owners, and get permission to publish
the sensors in the cloud. Sensor publishers are separate
business entities. When a sensor owner
registers a
speciﬁc sensor, SP collects information about the sensor
availability, owner preferences and restriction, expected
return, etc. All this information needs to be published in
the cloud. Once the registration is done, a SP waits until
a sensor consumer makes a request. When a SP receives
such a request, it forwards all the details including the offer
to the corresponding sensor owner(s) to accept or reject.
If the sensor owner accepts the offer, the corresponding
sensor data consumer will be able to acquire data from
that sensor through the SP during the period mentioned
in the agreement (offer). The same interaction explained
above can take place between SPs and ESPs. SPs entirely
depend on the payments (e.g. commission) receives from
sensor owners, sensor data consumers or both. Xively
[22] is a public cloud for the IoT that simpliﬁes and
accelerates the creation, deployment, and management,
of sensors in scalable manner. Further, it allows sharing
sensor data with each other though it is far away from being
qualiﬁed as a SP we envisioned in the sensing as a service
model. The OpenIoT project [23] focuses on providing an
open source middleware framework enabling the dynamic
formulation of self-managed cloud environments for IoT
applications. Global Sensor Networks (GSN) [24] is a
middleware which supports sensor deployments and offers
a ﬂexible, zero-programming deployment and integration
infrastructure for IoT. These approaches strengthen our
vision towards sensing as a service.

Extended Service Providers Layer: This

layer
consists of extended service providers (ESP). This layer
can be considered as the most intelligent among all the
four layers which embed the intelligence to the entire
service model. The services provided by ESPs can be
varied widely from one provider to another. However,
there are some fundamental characteristics of ESPs. To
become an ESP, they have to provide value added services
[25] to the sensor data consumers. However, in some
instances a single business entity can perform both sensor
publisher and extended service provider roles. Each SP
has access (only) to the sensors which are registered with
it. When a sensor data consumer needs sensor data from
multiple sensors where each sensor has been registered
with different SPs, ESPs can be used to acquire data easily.
ESPs communicate with multiple SPs regarding sensor
data acquisition on behalf of the sensor data consumer.
The ESPs depend on the payments (e.g. commission)

Figure 4. Sensor classiﬁcation scheme based on ownership

The same process will occur when physical properties
(e.g. land, building) are sold from one party to another.
This category would be the second largest sensor owner
after the personal and household category.

• The public organizations and places category is similar
to the private organizations and places category we
discussed above. However, this category also includes
public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, parks,
etc. All the sensors deployed by the government will
be published in the cloud depending on government
policies.

• Commercial sensor data providers are business entities
who deploy and manage sensors by themselves by
keeping ownership. They earn by publishing the sensors
and sensor data they own through sensor publishers.
They may deploy sensors across all places such
as households, private and public owned properties
depending on demand and strategic value by also
complying with legal terms. Mostly, they will focus
on public and private places. They will also make a
payment to the property owner as an exchange for
giving permissions for sensor deployment. For example,
commercial sensor data provider may deploy sensors
in a children’s park owned by state government (under
government permission) to detect motion and measure
the micro climate (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
speed, wind direction). Such monitoring allows to
detect and predict potential crowd movements. The
sensor data that can be used to predict such movements
can be sold to sensor data consumers such as mobile
stall businesses and children’s product retailers who
may be located in nearby areas.

A sensor owner makes the ﬁnal decision on whether
to publish the sensors he owns in the cloud or not. If the
owner decides not to publish, no sensor publisher would
be able to get access to those sensors which signiﬁcantly
protect the security and privacy of the sensor owner. If the
sensor owner decides to publish the sensors he owns, he
needs to register himself with a sensor publisher. Sensor
owners can deﬁne restrictions and conditions such as who
can request permission and the expected return (offer). It
is important to note that each sensor may send data to
a different SP in the cloud (similar as we use Internet
service providers). However, a single sensor only sends
data to a single SP (in order to save energy). Data will be

Figure 5. A futuristic scenario that explains the interactions in sensing as a service model

similar to SPs. ESPs receive payments for the value
added service they provided to their customers (i.e. sensor
data consumers). An example value added service can be
selecting sensors based on customer’s requirements [26].
Customers will provide their requirements in high-level
(e.g. measure environmental pollution in Canberra) instead
of selecting the sensors by themselves. In return, ESP
will select the appropriate sensors (e.g. pH, temperature,
humidity, CO2, etc.) located in Canberra. Pinto et al. [27]
have proposed an architectural approach for telecoms to
take advantage of machine-to-machine markets in the IoT
domain. It explains the opportunities business can address
by providing services related to connectivity management,
data management, and service provisioning.

Sensor Data Consumers Layer: This layer consists
of sensor data consumers. All the sensor data consumers
need to register themselves and obtain a valid digital
certiﬁcate from an authority in order
to consume
sensor data. Some of the major sensor data consumers
would be governments, business organizations, academic
institutions, and scientiﬁc research communities. Sensor
data consumers do not directly communicate with sensors
or sensor owners. All the communication and transactions
need to be done through either SPs or ESPs. If a sensor
consumer has the required technical capability, they can
directly acquire data from sensor publishers. However,
this could be very challenging. For example, selecting
which sensors to use out of billions of sensors available
could be an overwhelming task [28]. Further, sensor data
consumers may need to communicate with multiple sensor
publishers to acquire the required data. However, the cost
of sensor data acquisition would be lower as they are not
required to pay for ESPs’ value added services. Scientiﬁc
research communities may be interested in such methods.
The sensor consumers with less technical capabilities
and expertise can acquire required sensor data through
ESPs where most of the difﬁcult tasks such as combining
sensor data from multiple sensor publishers and selecting
appropriate sensors based on the consumer requirements
are handled. Further, sensor consumers can register their

Trans. Emerging Tel. Tech. 2014; 00:1–12 c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/ett

interests with both SPs, and ESPs. For example, they can
express their interest by using a number of constraints.
A coffee manufacture who expects to starts its business
in Canberra may be interested to access the sensor data
produced by coffee machines located in Canberra for a
fee. Depending on the expression of interest, ESPs/SPs
will notify the coffee manufacturer when a matching deal
is available. In simple terms, sensor owners deﬁne what
they are expecting as return for the sensor data from one
end of the Sensing as a service model. On the other end,
sensor consumers deﬁne what kind of sensor data they
want and how much are they willing to pay (offer). SPs and
ESPs are platforms that enable these transactions (deals) to
take place. The sensing as a service model shares common
characteristics of an auction [29].

4. THE FUTURE: A SCENARIO

A futuristic scenario can be used to explain the sensing
as a service model. The scenario illustrated in Figure 5 is
based on smart home domain which also plays a signiﬁcant
role in the Smart Cities. Our intention is to highlight the
interactions between different parties explained earlier in
high-level.

Mike bought a new refrigerator for his new home.
He brought it home and plugged it to the power. The
fridge automatically identiﬁes the availability of Wi-Fi in
the house as shown in step (1). Further, the refrigerator
communicates with a sensor publisher and informs about
its presence by providing information such as the available
sensors (e.g. RFID reader, temperature, door sensors) as
shown in step (2). Next, in step (3), the SP communicates
with Mike to check whether he likes to publish the sensors
attached to the refrigerator in the cloud (step 3). We
assume that Mike has already registered with the SP in
a previous transaction. Mike is allowed to deﬁne which
sensors to publish, what kind of consumers are allowed
to bid, and what kind of return (fee or any other offer) is

ice cream manufacturer, with an offer as shown in step
(4). DairyIceCream is interested to have access to the
RFID reader and the door sensor attached to the freezer in
Mike’s refrigerator. As a return, DairyIceCream is willing
to offer either 3% discount on every product purchased
from DairyIceCream or a monthly fee of $2. As Mike likes
DairyIceCream products, he agrees to the 3% discount
offer instead of the monthly fee as shown in step (5).
A week later, Mike receives an email from a company
called ProductiveAnalytics which has been sent on behalf
of the GoldenCheese company, a cheese manufacturer,
with an similar offer. This request also comes through
EasySensing. However, the offer is either 4% discount on
every product purchase by GoldenCheese or a monthly fee
of $1. As Mike does not like GoldenCheese products, he
decides to accept the monthly fee option.

represent

Scenario from model perspective: In Section 3, we
explained the sensing as a service model in a generic
perspective and now we describe it from the above
mentioned scenario perspective. In the scenario, Mike
is the sensor owner. Therefore, he and his sensors
represent the sensors and sensor owners layer. Further,
in ownership categorization, Mike represents the Personal
and households scheme. Both the DairyIceCream and
GoldenCheese companies
the sensor data
consumers layer. EasySensing is a SP who enables the
communication and transactions between Mike and the
DairyIceCream. EasySensing is responsible for matching
the sensor owners expectations with the requirements of
sensor data consumers. DairyIceCream retrieves the data
from EasySensing directly and conducts the data analysis
with the help of in-house experts. ProductiveAnalytics
is an ESP who works on behalf of GoldenCheese.
GoldenCheese has hired ProductiveAnalytics to perform
the data analysis as they do not have the required technical
skills within the company. ProductiveAnalytics collects the
data by handling all the deals and transaction with the
sensor owners though their partner SPs.

5. SENSING AS A SERVICE IN ACTION

In the previous section, we discussed a scenario related to
the smart home domain in sensing as a service perspective.
This section presents three different use case scenarios
that explain different aspects of the sensing as a service
model: (1) waste management, (2) smart agriculture, and
(3) environmental management. All three scenarios share
common a sets of characteristics as well as few unique
characteristics. Waste management has a direct impact on
cities. Environmental management has direct, indirect, and
long term impact on the entire human life-cycle both in
urban and rural living. Further, smart agriculture makes
indirect impact on sustainability towards the smart cities.

5.1. Waste Management

Waste management is one of the toughest challenge that
modern cities have to deal with. Waste management
consists of different processes such as collection, transport,
processing, disposal, managing, and monitoring of waste
materials. These processes cost signiﬁcant amount of
money, time, and labour. Optimizing waste management
processes help to save money that can be used to address
other challenges that smart cities need to deal with. In
Figure 6, we illustrate how the sensing as a service model
works in the waste management domain. In a modern
smart city, there are several parties who are interested in
waste management (e.g. city council, recycling companies,
manufacturing plants, and authorities related to health
and safety). Instead of deploying sensors and collecting
information independently, the sensing as a service model
allows all the interest groups to share the infrastructure
and bare the related costs collectively. The most important
aspect of such a collaboration is the cost reduction
that individual groups need to spend otherwise. All the
interested parties can retrieve and process sensor data in
real time in order to achieve their own objective. The cost
depends on the data requirement of the interest group.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

For example, a city council may use sensor data to
develop optimized garbage collection strategies, so they
can save fuel cost related to garbage trucks. Additionally,
recycling companies can use sensor data to predict and
track the amount of waste coming into their plants to be
processed so they can optimize their internal processes.
Further, health and safety authorities can monitor and
supervise the waste management process without spending
substantial amount of money for manual monitoring
inspections. The phenomenon of sharing sensor data using
a sensing as a service model creates a synergy effect (i.e.
interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce
an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects).
The sensing as a service model ensures the long term
sustainability of the IoT infrastructure.

the sensing as a service model

Let us discuss how this technology can be used to
support
in ﬁnancially
viable manner. In order to perform waste management,
different types of sensors need to be deployed in different
places such as garbage cans and trucks. These sensors
need to detect information such as the amount of garbage,
types of garbage, and so on. As we have depicted in
Figure 6, direct and indirect communication strategies
can be used to collect and communicate sensor data to
the cloud. Sensors with energy harvesting capabilities
are important
in this domain [30]. As represented in
step (1) in Figure 6, low powered [31] and low capable
sensors can be used to sense and data can be uploaded
to the cloud with the help of nearby infrastructure (e.g.
through communication devices attached to street lights
or similar infrastructure that have access to rich energy
sources and communication capabilities). Additionally,
when long range communication is not available, data can
be uploaded to the cloud with the help of auto-mobiles, as
depicted in step (2) in Figure 6, such as garbage trucks,
city council vehicles, buses that operate in the areas and
so on. Furthermore, both active and passive sensors can be
used to sense the environment [32]. Direct communication
can be done via technologies such as 3G which makes this
approach less dependant on third parties (as depicted in (3)
in Figure 6).

5.2. Smart Agriculture

Currently, the authors are actively involved in designing
and developing open platforms for sensor data collection,
processing and sharing in the domain of agriculture
through two projects: Phenonet [33] and OpenIoT [23].
In this scenario, the general public is not directly involved
as in the smart home domain. In Figure 7, we illustrate
how the sensing as a service model works in the smart
agriculture domain. Agriculture is an importation part of
smart cities as it contributes to the food supply-chain that
facilitates a large number of communities concentrated
into cities.

The sensing as a service model allows to conduct
scientiﬁc research and exploration more efﬁciently
and efﬁciently. Further, it opens up different research

Figure 7. Efﬁcient and effective collaborative research sup-

opportunities which are unlikely to occurr in a traditional
research model. Let us explain the Phenonet project in
details and the applicability of the sensing as a service
model towards agricultural research. Phenonet describes
the network of sensors collecting information over a
ﬁeld of experimental crops. Researchers at
the High
Resolution Plant Phenomics Centre are testing a network
of smart sensor nodes able to monitor plant growth and
performance information and climate conditions. Even
though the main research goal of deploying sensors
and collecting data is to understand plant growth under
different climate conditions,
the same set of sensors
can be utilized to perform a verity of different research
activities in different domains. The data can be shared
among different research organizations and institutions
located around the world. Due to limited funding, most
of these research institutions may not be able to maintain
large scale sensor deployments (e.g. academic institutions,
specially in developing countries). However, the sensing
as a service model allows all these interest groups, who
are unable to set-up their own sensor deployments, to
perform research using actual data with signiﬁcantly less
costs. Further, the sensing as a service model creates

opportunities across different domains. For example, the
above mentioned sensor data can be used to understand
pest control and related phenomenon. Additionally they
can be used to understand soil conditions where bio-
scientist may be interested. More importantly, the sensing
as a service model allows researchers to share resources
across borders and understand phenomenon which are not
available in their own countries.

5.3. Environmental Management

This domain has the unique ability of utilizing existing
sensors that are deployed for different reasons. Most
of the sensors used in environmental monitoring are
commonly used in other domains such as climate, wild
ﬁre detection, and structural health monitoring. Using
the sensing as a service model,
interest groups can
acquire relevant sensor data without deploying sensors by
themselves. Further, environmental management is a large
domain where a single organization cannot deal with (e.g.
wild ﬁre). A model like sensing as a service stimulates
innovative solutions that use the same data but produce
different results using different processing and analysing
techniques (e.g. prediction, visualization, simulation). As
we discussed in Section 3, ESPs can help the sensor data
consumers to orchestrate existing services into different
data processing [34] and analysis work-ﬂows [35].

6. ADVANTAGES AND BENEFITS

Some of the major advantages and beneﬁts in the sensing
as a service model are discussed below:
• Built-in cloud computing: It is modelled around cloud
computing. Therefore, it inherits all the beneﬁts of
the fundamental cloud computing models such as
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Scalable and widely accessible
processing and storage resources are available to
facilitate sensing as a service software platforms (SPs
and ESPs). Sensor data consumers only need to pay for
the data they use. Therefore, the cost of data acquisition
reduces signiﬁcantly due to sharing, participatory /
crowd sourcing, and reusing nature (i.e. sense once and
use by many).

• Participatory sensing: The workload is distributed
among different players in the model. This enables
rapid deployment of sensors across wider geographical
locations that capture various phenomena.

• Sharing and reusing: In traditional methods, each party
(group or person) who wants to collect sensor data
needs to visit the ﬁeld and deploy the sensors manually
by themselves. Further, there is no easy way to share
sensor data collected by one party with others. Sensing
as a service is a model that stimulates by concept
of sharing. In simple terms, if someone has already
deployed the sensors, others can have access to them

8

by paying a fee to the sensor owner. One of the
major arguments that could arise regarding sensing as a
service model is that “How to convince a manufacturer
to embed sensors and communication capabilities into
devices we use in everyday life (e.g refrigerator in the
use-case presented in Section 4)”. This question can be
answered in two different perspectives.
First, IoT envisions to have sensor embedded into
objects around us. The goal of IoT is to allow devices
to communicate with each other. Naturally, such a goal
forces next generation devices to be embedded with rich
sensing and communication capabilities. Therefore,
the motivation is given to the manufacturers not by
the sensing as a service model but
the vision of
IoT. The sensing as a service model is designed to
provide incentives to users which motivate them to
purchase next generation devices that supports both
IoT envisioned interactions as well as the sensing as a
service model. The additional cost that contributes to
increase the prices of the devices (due to embedding
rich sensing and communication capabilities) can be
easily covered by participating in the sensing as a
service model
itself. Even today, state of the art
devices such as refrigerators and televisions comprise
communication and sensing capabilities.

• Reduction of data acquisition cost: Due to the shared
and collaborative nature, data acquisition cost will
be reduced signiﬁcantly. Such a sustainable business
model stimulates more and more sensor deployments.
Further, technological advances and higher demands
allow to produce sensors in mass volumes using cheap
materials by reducing the cost per unit. Further, this
helps to collect data from sensors which was impossible
previously.

• Collect data previously unavailable: This model allows
to collect sensor data which is impossible to collect
using traditional non-collaborative methods. This
business model promotes and stimulates the sensor
deployments by companies at commercial level. As
we explained earlier in Section 3, dedicated business
entities will deploy sensors in public places such
as parks and bridges so government authorities can
have access to those sensors by paying only for
the data they need in real-time or archived. Today
business entities spend substantial amount of money
to conduct market analyses and consumer surveys.
A sample of 1,000 respondents, which would give a
statistical accuracy of +/-3.1% costs around $8,000
[36]. Recently, different third party companies started
offering consumer surveys on behalf of businesses.
One such solution is Google Consumer Surveys
(www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys). Google
Consumer Surveys allows businesses to target user
groups with speciﬁc criteria and conduct the survey.
Currently, one user response cost around $0.10, 1/10th
of the cost of similar quality research conduct using
traditional methods.

Perera et al.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

Even though such approaches have reduced the cost
of surveys, they still have deﬁciencies such as latency,
inaccuracies, and so on. In the sensing as a service
model, all the data is directly coming from the sensor
without user intervention. This also helps to reduce the
cost of data acquisition. Due to privacy concerns it is
important to anonymise the sensor data collected. We
discuss privacy matters later. In the smart home scenario
we discussed in Section 4, we explained how a single
sensor attached to a refrigerator, and cheap passive
RFID tags attached to consumer products, produce
valuable information of consumer behaviour that can be
used by thousand of companies. This drastically reduces
the consumer survey cost as well as pay off the cost of
attaching sensors to the products.

• Innovations: Due to a reduction in sensor data acquisition
cost, larger number of interest groups will be able
to access to them. Further, the availability of sensor
data which was not available previously can also
signiﬁcantly stimulate innovation . Sensing as a service
model itself provides space for innovation in the ESP
layer. The cloud-based value added services provided
in the ESP layer allows the sensor data consumers
to achieve their objective easily and faster in many
different application domains.

• Applications: Easily accessible sensor data allows
government authorities, academia, research institutions,
and businesses to address different challenges in
Smart Cities such as trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
and unemployment, health, and crime management.
For example, accurate data on energy consumption
in a city allows managing electric grids efﬁciently
by analysing and predicting energy consumption
behaviours, patterns, future trends, and needs.

• Real-time data for decision making and policy making:
This model enables collecting sensor data in real-
time, from a variety of different domains, which
facilitates the decision making processes. Such data is
expensive to collect and usually unavailable for decision
making in traditional sensor deploying environments.
For example, data collected from sensors deployed in
vehicles and roads allow the authorities to monitor
and manage trafﬁc in real-time. Further, sensor data
collected over a period of time (archived) can be used
to make policy decisions. For example, trafﬁc data over
a period on a speciﬁc city will help a city governance
to make long term strategic decisions such as whether
to invest on a tram service across the city or not. In
addition to the points discussed above, there are many
other direct and indirect beneﬁts in the sensing as a
service model.

• Direct and indirect beneﬁts: The sensing as a service
model creates a win-win situation for all the parties
involved. Based on the scenario we presented in Section
4, Mike (sensor owners’ perspective) is getting a
return (a valuable offer). In DairyIceCream perspective,

Trans. Emerging Tel. Tech. 2014; 00:1–12 c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/ett
Prepared using ettauth.cls

now they have real-time data about product consumer
behaviour (e.g. when Mike eats ice cream, how frequent,
whether Mike use substitutions and so on). Therefore,
DairyIceCream is no longer required to conduct manual
surveys and market analyses.

• Privacy preservation: Finally and more importantly,
this model provide complete control of the privacy of
sensor owners in their own hands. The ﬁnal decision
of whether to publish their sensors or not is taken
by the sensor owners. It allows the sensor owners
to control and protect their privacy. Additionally, the
sensing as a service model needs to be supported by
anonymization techniques. For example, lets consider
security and privacy challenges [37] related to the smart
home scenario we presented in Section 4. During the
conﬁguration process, it is important to identify the
information and preferences related to Mike. In order
to protect
the privacy of the users, SPs and ESPs
should not provide personal information to the sensor
data consumers. Such approach helps to preserve user
privacy. Additionally, once the deal between the sensor
owner, sensor consumer and the sensor provider is
done, data retrieves from Mike’s sensors should be
explicitly anonymized. It is important to develop new
algorithms and security devices that can anonymize
sensitive information (such as exact location).

7. OPEN CHALLENGES

The sensing as a service model can contribute signiﬁcantly
to address the challenges in the IoT and SC. There are
many open challenges and issues that need to be tackled.
We identify some of the major challenges in the sensing
as a service model under three categories in Table I:
technological, economical, and social, where some can
be discussed under multiple categories. Each of these
challenges shows research directions for future work in the
sensing as a service domain.

8. CONCLUSIONS

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
sensing as a service model and its applicability towards
Smart Cities in the Internet of Things paradigm. Our
vision is backed up by a number of projects initiated
around the globe, including FP7 ICT project OpenIoT [23].
We discussed the model from three different perspectives
including technological, economical, and social. We
examined how the sensing as a service can be a sustainable,
scalable, and powerful model. The sensing as a service
model allows utilizing resources efﬁciently so limited
resource can be used to accommodate large numbers of
consumers. Further, it also creates a win-win situation for
all the parties involved. We identiﬁed a number of major

ABSTRACT

The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world’s population
thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of
resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efﬁcient city management
has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to ﬁnd
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained signiﬁcant attention over the
past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efﬁcient and effective
resource management in Smart Cities. Today infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it ﬁts with the Internet of
Things. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical, and social
perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues. Copyright c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Smart Cities (SC) [2]
are recent phenomena that have attracted the attention from
both academia and industry. While both ideas consolidate
similar ideology, they have different origins. Both IoT
and SC do not have clear and concise deﬁnitions due to
their short history and broadness. Examining the origins of
both ideas in brief allows us to understand their potentials.
Even though the term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined
in 1999 [3], the technologies that enable IoT such as
sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
we brieﬂy review the trend of everything as service in
Section 2. In Section 3, the sensing as a service model
is presented. Subsequently, we explain the sensing as a
service model using a futuristic scenario in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss several use case scenarios that
highlight the different aspects of the sensing as a service
model. Advantages in sensing as a service model are
discussed in Section 6. Later, in Section 7, we highlight

Smart City initiatives have become another

process inefﬁcient. In XaaS, online retail applications are
hosted in servers facilitated by cloud service provider
where the business is only required to pay for the resource
it consumes. This model works similar to the utility
services such as electricity. Further, cloud computing
service models provide many other beneﬁts such as
business agility, scalability and elasticity, reliability, green
initiatives, less maintenance work including backup and
disaster recovery. Ultimately, XaaS allows businesses to
focus more on core competency and innovation instead of
ICT [14]. Further explanation on characteristics, features
and beneﬁts of cloud computing are presented in [12, 15].
trend
during the past decade. Various city councils, business
organizations, research and academic institutions, and the
governments have invested signiﬁcantly in projects to
study, design, and build solutions to address the problems
in urban cities using ICT. IBM Smart Planet and Smart
Cities, Oracle iGovernment, Amsterdam Smart City, Dubai
SmartCity, EuropeanSmartCities, and Smart Cities Future
are some of the leading Smart City projects [16, 17]. The
following statistics show the magnitude of both trends.
Global cloud computing and XaaS market is expected to
grow from $37.8 billion in 2010 to $121.1 billion by 2015,
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
26.2% from 2010 to 2015 [14]. Similarly, the global Smart
City market is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2016,
growing at a CAGR of 14.2% [18].

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in
detail. As depicted in Figure 3, the sensing as a service
model consists of four conceptual layers: 1) sensors and
sensor owners, 2) sensor publishers, 3) extended service
providers, and 4) sensor data consumers. In this section,
we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic
conceptual form. In Section 4, we present a real world
scenario based on this model. At the end of Section 4, we
map the real world scenario into the conceptual model in
order to provide a practical understanding.

Sensors and Sensor Owners Layer: This layer
consists of sensors and sensor owners. A sensor is a device
that detects, measures or sense a physical phenomenon
such as humidity, temperature, etc. [19]. Multiple sensors
can be attached to an object or device. For example,
microwaves or coffee machines may have sensors that
can be used to detect events (e.g. the number of times
it is used per day and related context information). Such

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

information can be used to understand user behaviour and
user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

shared between SPs if necessary depending on consumer
requirements. Even though all four categories perfom the
same task (i.e. sensor deployment and publication), the
decision making processes can be quite different especially
in term of objectives, ﬁnancial goals, approval processes,
privacy and policy concerns.

Sensor Publishers Layer: This layer consists of sensor
publishers (SP). The main responsibility of a sensor
publisher is to detect available sensors, communicate
with the sensor owners, and get permission to publish
the sensors in the cloud. Sensor publishers are separate
business entities. When a sensor owner
registers a
speciﬁc sensor, SP collects information about the sensor
availability, owner preferences and restriction, expected
return, etc. All this information needs to be published in
the cloud. Once the registration is done, a SP waits until
a sensor consumer makes a request. When a SP receives
such a request, it forwards all the details including the offer
to the corresponding sensor owner(s) to accept or reject.
If the sensor owner accepts the offer, the corresponding
sensor data consumer will be able to acquire data from
that sensor through the SP during the period mentioned
in the agreement (offer). The same interaction explained
above can take place between SPs and ESPs. SPs entirely
depend on the payments (e.g. commission) receives from
sensor owners, sensor data consumers or both. Xively
[22] is a public cloud for the IoT that simpliﬁes and
accelerates the creation, deployment, and management,
of sensors in scalable manner. Further, it allows sharing
sensor data with each other though it is far away from being
qualiﬁed as a SP we envisioned in the sensing as a service
model. The OpenIoT project [23] focuses on providing an
open source middleware framework enabling the dynamic
formulation of self-managed cloud environments for IoT
applications. Global Sensor Networks (GSN) [24] is a
middleware which supports sensor deployments and offers
a ﬂexible, zero-programming deployment and integration
infrastructure for IoT. These approaches strengthen our
vision towards sensing as a service.

Extended Service Providers Layer: This

layer
consists of extended service providers (ESP). This layer
can be considered as the most intelligent among all the
four layers which embed the intelligence to the entire
service model. The services provided by ESPs can be
varied widely from one provider to another. However,
there are some fundamental characteristics of ESPs. To
become an ESP, they have to provide value added services
[25] to the sensor data consumers. However, in some
instances a single business entity can perform both sensor
publisher and extended service provider roles. Each SP
has access (only) to the sensors which are registered with
it. When a sensor data consumer needs sensor data from
multiple sensors where each sensor has been registered
with different SPs, ESPs can be used to acquire data easily.
ESPs communicate with multiple SPs regarding sensor
data acquisition on behalf of the sensor data consumer.
The ESPs depend on the payments (e.g. commission)

Figure 4. Sensor classiﬁcation scheme based on ownership

The same process will occur when physical properties
(e.g. land, building) are sold from one party to another.
This category would be the second largest sensor owner
after the personal and household category.

• The public organizations and places category is similar
to the private organizations and places category we
discussed above. However, this category also includes
public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, parks,
etc. All the sensors deployed by the government will
be published in the cloud depending on government
policies.

• Commercial sensor data providers are business entities
who deploy and manage sensors by themselves by
keeping ownership. They earn by publishing the sensors
and sensor data they own through sensor publishers.
They may deploy sensors across all places such
as households, private and public owned properties
depending on demand and strategic value by also
complying with legal terms. Mostly, they will focus
on public and private places. They will also make a
payment to the property owner as an exchange for
giving permissions for sensor deployment. For example,
commercial sensor data provider may deploy sensors
in a children’s park owned by state government (under
government permission) to detect motion and measure
the micro climate (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
speed, wind direction). Such monitoring allows to
detect and predict potential crowd movements. The
sensor data that can be used to predict such movements
can be sold to sensor data consumers such as mobile
stall businesses and children’s product retailers who
may be located in nearby areas.

A sensor owner makes the ﬁnal decision on whether
to publish the sensors he owns in the cloud or not. If the
owner decides not to publish, no sensor publisher would
be able to get access to those sensors which signiﬁcantly
protect the security and privacy of the sensor owner. If the
sensor owner decides to publish the sensors he owns, he
needs to register himself with a sensor publisher. Sensor
owners can deﬁne restrictions and conditions such as who
can request permission and the expected return (offer). It
is important to note that each sensor may send data to
a different SP in the cloud (similar as we use Internet
service providers). However, a single sensor only sends
data to a single SP (in order to save energy). Data will be

Figure 5. A futuristic scenario that explains the interactions in sensing as a service model

similar to SPs. ESPs receive payments for the value
added service they provided to their customers (i.e. sensor
data consumers). An example value added service can be
selecting sensors based on customer’s requirements [26].
Customers will provide their requirements in high-level
(e.g. measure environmental pollution in Canberra) instead
of selecting the sensors by themselves. In return, ESP
will select the appropriate sensors (e.g. pH, temperature,
humidity, CO2, etc.) located in Canberra. Pinto et al. [27]
have proposed an architectural approach for telecoms to
take advantage of machine-to-machine markets in the IoT
domain. It explains the opportunities business can address
by providing services related to connectivity management,
data management, and service provisioning.

Sensor Data Consumers Layer: This layer consists
of sensor data consumers. All the sensor data consumers
need to register themselves and obtain a valid digital
certiﬁcate from an authority in order
to consume
sensor data. Some of the major sensor data consumers
would be governments, business organizations, academic
institutions, and scientiﬁc research communities. Sensor
data consumers do not directly communicate with sensors
or sensor owners. All the communication and transactions
need to be done through either SPs or ESPs. If a sensor
consumer has the required technical capability, they can
directly acquire data from sensor publishers. However,
this could be very challenging. For example, selecting
which sensors to use out of billions of sensors available
could be an overwhelming task [28]. Further, sensor data
consumers may need to communicate with multiple sensor
publishers to acquire the required data. However, the cost
of sensor data acquisition would be lower as they are not
required to pay for ESPs’ value added services. Scientiﬁc
research communities may be interested in such methods.
The sensor consumers with less technical capabilities
and expertise can acquire required sensor data through
ESPs where most of the difﬁcult tasks such as combining
sensor data from multiple sensor publishers and selecting
appropriate sensors based on the consumer requirements
are handled. Further, sensor consumers can register their

interests with both SPs, and ESPs. For example, they can
express their interest by using a number of constraints.
A coffee manufacture who expects to starts its business
in Canberra may be interested to access the sensor data
produced by coffee machines located in Canberra for a
fee. Depending on the expression of interest, ESPs/SPs
will notify the coffee manufacturer when a matching deal
is available. In simple terms, sensor owners deﬁne what
they are expecting as return for the sensor data from one
end of the Sensing as a service model. On the other end,
sensor consumers deﬁne what kind of sensor data they
want and how much are they willing to pay (offer). SPs and
ESPs are platforms that enable these transactions (deals) to
take place. The sensing as a service model shares common
characteristics of an auction [29].

4. THE FUTURE: A SCENARIO

A futuristic scenario can be used to explain the sensing
as a service model. The scenario illustrated in Figure 5 is
based on smart home domain which also plays a signiﬁcant
role in the Smart Cities. Our intention is to highlight the
interactions between different parties explained earlier in
high-level.

Mike bought a new refrigerator for his new home.
He brought it home and plugged it to the power. The
fridge automatically identiﬁes the availability of Wi-Fi in
the house as shown in step (1). Further, the refrigerator
communicates with a sensor publisher and informs about
its presence by providing information such as the available
sensors (e.g. RFID reader, temperature, door sensors) as
shown in step (2). Next, in step (3), the SP communicates
with Mike to check whether he likes to publish the sensors
attached to the refrigerator in the cloud (step 3). We
assume that Mike has already registered with the SP in
a previous transaction. Mike is allowed to deﬁne which
sensors to publish, what kind of consumers are allowed
to bid, and what kind of return (fee or any other offer) is
expected. Later, Mike receives an email from a company

ice cream manufacturer, with an offer as shown in step
(4). DairyIceCream is interested to have access to the
RFID reader and the door sensor attached to the freezer in
Mike’s refrigerator. As a return, DairyIceCream is willing
to offer either 3% discount on every product purchased
from DairyIceCream or a monthly fee of $2. As Mike likes
DairyIceCream products, he agrees to the 3% discount
offer instead of the monthly fee as shown in step (5).
A week later, Mike receives an email from a company
called ProductiveAnalytics which has been sent on behalf
of the GoldenCheese company, a cheese manufacturer,
with an similar offer. This request also comes through
EasySensing. However, the offer is either 4% discount on
every product purchase by GoldenCheese or a monthly fee
of $1. As Mike does not like GoldenCheese products, he
decides to accept the monthly fee option.

represent

Scenario from model perspective: In Section 3, we
explained the sensing as a service model in a generic
perspective and now we describe it from the above
mentioned scenario perspective. In the scenario, Mike
is the sensor owner. Therefore, he and his sensors
represent the sensors and sensor owners layer. Further,
in ownership categorization, Mike represents the Personal
and households scheme. Both the DairyIceCream and
GoldenCheese companies
the sensor data
consumers layer. EasySensing is a SP who enables the
communication and transactions between Mike and the
DairyIceCream. EasySensing is responsible for matching
the sensor owners expectations with the requirements of
sensor data consumers. DairyIceCream retrieves the data
from EasySensing directly and conducts the data analysis
with the help of in-house experts. ProductiveAnalytics
is an ESP who works on behalf of GoldenCheese.
GoldenCheese has hired ProductiveAnalytics to perform
the data analysis as they do not have the required technical
skills within the company. ProductiveAnalytics collects the
data by handling all the deals and transaction with the
sensor owners though their partner SPs.

5. SENSING AS A SERVICE IN ACTION

In the previous section, we discussed a scenario related to
the smart home domain in sensing as a service perspective.
This section presents three different use case scenarios
that explain different aspects of the sensing as a service
model: (1) waste management, (2) smart agriculture, and
(3) environmental management. All three scenarios share
common a sets of characteristics as well as few unique
characteristics. Waste management has a direct impact on
cities. Environmental management has direct, indirect, and
long term impact on the entire human life-cycle both in
urban and rural living. Further, smart agriculture makes
indirect impact on sustainability towards the smart cities.

5.1. Waste Management

Waste management is one of the toughest challenge that
modern cities have to deal with. Waste management
consists of different processes such as collection, transport,
processing, disposal, managing, and monitoring of waste
materials. These processes cost signiﬁcant amount of
money, time, and labour. Optimizing waste management
processes help to save money that can be used to address
other challenges that smart cities need to deal with. In
Figure 6, we illustrate how the sensing as a service model
works in the waste management domain. In a modern
smart city, there are several parties who are interested in
waste management (e.g. city council, recycling companies,
manufacturing plants, and authorities related to health
and safety). Instead of deploying sensors and collecting
information independently, the sensing as a service model
allows all the interest groups to share the infrastructure
and bare the related costs collectively. The most important
aspect of such a collaboration is the cost reduction
that individual groups need to spend otherwise. All the
interested parties can retrieve and process sensor data in
real time in order to achieve their own objective. The cost
depends on the data requirement of the interest group.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

For example, a city council may use sensor data to
develop optimized garbage collection strategies, so they
can save fuel cost related to garbage trucks. Additionally,
recycling companies can use sensor data to predict and
track the amount of waste coming into their plants to be
processed so they can optimize their internal processes.
Further, health and safety authorities can monitor and
supervise the waste management process without spending
substantial amount of money for manual monitoring
inspections. The phenomenon of sharing sensor data using
a sensing as a service model creates a synergy effect (i.e.
interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce
an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects).
The sensing as a service model ensures the long term
sustainability of the IoT infrastructure.

the sensing as a service model

Let us discuss how this technology can be used to
support
in ﬁnancially
viable manner. In order to perform waste management,
different types of sensors need to be deployed in different
places such as garbage cans and trucks. These sensors
need to detect information such as the amount of garbage,
types of garbage, and so on. As we have depicted in
Figure 6, direct and indirect communication strategies
can be used to collect and communicate sensor data to
the cloud. Sensors with energy harvesting capabilities
are important
in this domain [30]. As represented in
step (1) in Figure 6, low powered [31] and low capable
sensors can be used to sense and data can be uploaded
to the cloud with the help of nearby infrastructure (e.g.
through communication devices attached to street lights
or similar infrastructure that have access to rich energy
sources and communication capabilities). Additionally,
when long range communication is not available, data can
be uploaded to the cloud with the help of auto-mobiles, as
depicted in step (2) in Figure 6, such as garbage trucks,
city council vehicles, buses that operate in the areas and
so on. Furthermore, both active and passive sensors can be
used to sense the environment [32]. Direct communication
can be done via technologies such as 3G which makes this
approach less dependant on third parties (as depicted in (3)
in Figure 6).

5.2. Smart Agriculture

Currently, the authors are actively involved in designing
and developing open platforms for sensor data collection,
processing and sharing in the domain of agriculture
through two projects: Phenonet [33] and OpenIoT [23].
In this scenario, the general public is not directly involved
as in the smart home domain. In Figure 7, we illustrate
how the sensing as a service model works in the smart
agriculture domain. Agriculture is an importation part of
smart cities as it contributes to the food supply-chain that
facilitates a large number of communities concentrated
into cities.

The sensing as a service model allows to conduct
scientiﬁc research and exploration more efﬁciently
and efﬁciently. Further, it opens up different research

Figure 7. Efﬁcient and effective collaborative research sup-

ported by sensing as a service model

opportunities which are unlikely to occurr in a traditional
research model. Let us explain the Phenonet project in
details and the applicability of the sensing as a service
model towards agricultural research. Phenonet describes
the network of sensors collecting information over a
ﬁeld of experimental crops. Researchers at
the High
Resolution Plant Phenomics Centre are testing a network
of smart sensor nodes able to monitor plant growth and
performance information and climate conditions. Even
though the main research goal of deploying sensors
and collecting data is to understand plant growth under
different climate conditions,
the same set of sensors
can be utilized to perform a verity of different research
activities in different domains. The data can be shared
among different research organizations and institutions
located around the world. Due to limited funding, most
of these research institutions may not be able to maintain
large scale sensor deployments (e.g. academic institutions,
specially in developing countries). However, the sensing
as a service model allows all these interest groups, who
are unable to set-up their own sensor deployments, to
perform research using actual data with signiﬁcantly less
costs. Further, the sensing as a service model creates

opportunities across different domains. For example, the
above mentioned sensor data can be used to understand
pest control and related phenomenon. Additionally they
can be used to understand soil conditions where bio-
scientist may be interested. More importantly, the sensing
as a service model allows researchers to share resources
across borders and understand phenomenon which are not
available in their own countries.

5.3. Environmental Management

This domain has the unique ability of utilizing existing
sensors that are deployed for different reasons. Most
of the sensors used in environmental monitoring are
commonly used in other domains such as climate, wild
ﬁre detection, and structural health monitoring. Using
the sensing as a service model,
interest groups can
acquire relevant sensor data without deploying sensors by
themselves. Further, environmental management is a large
domain where a single organization cannot deal with (e.g.
wild ﬁre). A model like sensing as a service stimulates
innovative solutions that use the same data but produce
different results using different processing and analysing
techniques (e.g. prediction, visualization, simulation). As
we discussed in Section 3, ESPs can help the sensor data
consumers to orchestrate existing services into different
data processing [34] and analysis work-ﬂows [35].

6. ADVANTAGES AND BENEFITS

Some of the major advantages and beneﬁts in the sensing
as a service model are discussed below:
• Built-in cloud computing: It is modelled around cloud
computing. Therefore, it inherits all the beneﬁts of
the fundamental cloud computing models such as
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Scalable and widely accessible
processing and storage resources are available to
facilitate sensing as a service software platforms (SPs
and ESPs). Sensor data consumers only need to pay for
the data they use. Therefore, the cost of data acquisition
reduces signiﬁcantly due to sharing, participatory /
crowd sourcing, and reusing nature (i.e. sense once and
use by many).

• Participatory sensing: The workload is distributed
among different players in the model. This enables
rapid deployment of sensors across wider geographical
locations that capture various phenomena.

• Sharing and reusing: In traditional methods, each party
(group or person) who wants to collect sensor data
needs to visit the ﬁeld and deploy the sensors manually
by themselves. Further, there is no easy way to share
sensor data collected by one party with others. Sensing
as a service is a model that stimulates by concept
of sharing. In simple terms, if someone has already
deployed the sensors, others can have access to them

8

by paying a fee to the sensor owner. One of the
major arguments that could arise regarding sensing as a
service model is that “How to convince a manufacturer
to embed sensors and communication capabilities into
devices we use in everyday life (e.g refrigerator in the
use-case presented in Section 4)”. This question can be
answered in two different perspectives.
First, IoT envisions to have sensor embedded into
objects around us. The goal of IoT is to allow devices
to communicate with each other. Naturally, such a goal
forces next generation devices to be embedded with rich
sensing and communication capabilities. Therefore,
the motivation is given to the manufacturers not by
the sensing as a service model but
the vision of
IoT. The sensing as a service model is designed to
provide incentives to users which motivate them to
purchase next generation devices that supports both
IoT envisioned interactions as well as the sensing as a
service model. The additional cost that contributes to
increase the prices of the devices (due to embedding
rich sensing and communication capabilities) can be
easily covered by participating in the sensing as a
service model
itself. Even today, state of the art
devices such as refrigerators and televisions comprise
communication and sensing capabilities.

• Reduction of data acquisition cost: Due to the shared
and collaborative nature, data acquisition cost will
be reduced signiﬁcantly. Such a sustainable business
model stimulates more and more sensor deployments.
Further, technological advances and higher demands
allow to produce sensors in mass volumes using cheap
materials by reducing the cost per unit. Further, this
helps to collect data from sensors which was impossible
previously.

• Collect data previously unavailable: This model allows
to collect sensor data which is impossible to collect
using traditional non-collaborative methods. This
business model promotes and stimulates the sensor
deployments by companies at commercial level. As
we explained earlier in Section 3, dedicated business
entities will deploy sensors in public places such
as parks and bridges so government authorities can
have access to those sensors by paying only for
the data they need in real-time or archived. Today
business entities spend substantial amount of money
to conduct market analyses and consumer surveys.
A sample of 1,000 respondents, which would give a
statistical accuracy of +/-3.1% costs around $8,000
[36]. Recently, different third party companies started
offering consumer surveys on behalf of businesses.
One such solution is Google Consumer Surveys
(www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys). Google
Consumer Surveys allows businesses to target user
groups with speciﬁc criteria and conduct the survey.
Currently, one user response cost around $0.10, 1/10th
of the cost of similar quality research conduct using
traditional methods.

Perera et al.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

Even though such approaches have reduced the cost
of surveys, they still have deﬁciencies such as latency,
inaccuracies, and so on. In the sensing as a service
model, all the data is directly coming from the sensor
without user intervention. This also helps to reduce the
cost of data acquisition. Due to privacy concerns it is
important to anonymise the sensor data collected. We
discuss privacy matters later. In the smart home scenario
we discussed in Section 4, we explained how a single
sensor attached to a refrigerator, and cheap passive
RFID tags attached to consumer products, produce
valuable information of consumer behaviour that can be
used by thousand of companies. This drastically reduces
the consumer survey cost as well as pay off the cost of
attaching sensors to the products.

• Innovations: Due to a reduction in sensor data acquisition
cost, larger number of interest groups will be able
to access to them. Further, the availability of sensor
data which was not available previously can also
signiﬁcantly stimulate innovation . Sensing as a service
model itself provides space for innovation in the ESP
layer. The cloud-based value added services provided
in the ESP layer allows the sensor data consumers
to achieve their objective easily and faster in many
different application domains.

• Applications: Easily accessible sensor data allows
government authorities, academia, research institutions,
and businesses to address different challenges in
Smart Cities such as trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
and unemployment, health, and crime management.
For example, accurate data on energy consumption
in a city allows managing electric grids efﬁciently
by analysing and predicting energy consumption
behaviours, patterns, future trends, and needs.

• Real-time data for decision making and policy making:
This model enables collecting sensor data in real-
time, from a variety of different domains, which
facilitates the decision making processes. Such data is
expensive to collect and usually unavailable for decision
making in traditional sensor deploying environments.
For example, data collected from sensors deployed in
vehicles and roads allow the authorities to monitor
and manage trafﬁc in real-time. Further, sensor data
collected over a period of time (archived) can be used
to make policy decisions. For example, trafﬁc data over
a period on a speciﬁc city will help a city governance
to make long term strategic decisions such as whether
to invest on a tram service across the city or not. In
addition to the points discussed above, there are many
other direct and indirect beneﬁts in the sensing as a
service model.

• Direct and indirect beneﬁts: The sensing as a service
model creates a win-win situation for all the parties
involved. Based on the scenario we presented in Section
4, Mike (sensor owners’ perspective) is getting a
return (a valuable offer). In DairyIceCream perspective,

Trans. Emerging Tel. Tech. 2014; 00:1–12 c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/ett
Prepared using ettauth.cls

now they have real-time data about product consumer
behaviour (e.g. when Mike eats ice cream, how frequent,
whether Mike use substitutions and so on). Therefore,
DairyIceCream is no longer required to conduct manual
surveys and market analyses.

• Privacy preservation: Finally and more importantly,
this model provide complete control of the privacy of
sensor owners in their own hands. The ﬁnal decision
of whether to publish their sensors or not is taken
by the sensor owners. It allows the sensor owners
to control and protect their privacy. Additionally, the
sensing as a service model needs to be supported by
anonymization techniques. For example, lets consider
security and privacy challenges [37] related to the smart
home scenario we presented in Section 4. During the
conﬁguration process, it is important to identify the
information and preferences related to Mike. In order
to protect
the privacy of the users, SPs and ESPs
should not provide personal information to the sensor
data consumers. Such approach helps to preserve user
privacy. Additionally, once the deal between the sensor
owner, sensor consumer and the sensor provider is
done, data retrieves from Mike’s sensors should be
explicitly anonymized. It is important to develop new
algorithms and security devices that can anonymize
sensitive information (such as exact location).

7. OPEN CHALLENGES

The sensing as a service model can contribute signiﬁcantly
to address the challenges in the IoT and SC. There are
many open challenges and issues that need to be tackled.
We identify some of the major challenges in the sensing
as a service model under three categories in Table I:
technological, economical, and social, where some can
be discussed under multiple categories. Each of these
challenges shows research directions for future work in the
sensing as a service domain.

8. CONCLUSIONS

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
sensing as a service model and its applicability towards
Smart Cities in the Internet of Things paradigm. Our
vision is backed up by a number of projects initiated
around the globe, including FP7 ICT project OpenIoT [23].
We discussed the model from three different perspectives
including technological, economical, and social. We
examined how the sensing as a service can be a sustainable,
scalable, and powerful model. The sensing as a service
model allows utilizing resources efﬁciently so limited
resource can be used to accommodate large numbers of
consumers. Further, it also creates a win-win situation for
all the parties involved. We identiﬁed a number of major

Description, signiﬁcance, and research directions to address the challenges

• Technology plays the most important role in enabling the sensing as a service model. This model uses the same
infrastructure that IoT envisions. Therefore, most of the technological solutions that are developed to facilitate
sensing as a service can be used to realize the vision of IoT. The sensing as a service model is expected to
facilitate billions of sensors and parallel sensor data streams. A major challenge is to develop middleware
solutions that allow to handle such demand [23]. Similarly, this model needs signiﬁcant improvements in data
communication bandwidth [38] over the existing infrastructure (e.g. ﬁber). Another major challenge is the
sensor conﬁguration. The term ‘sensor conﬁguration’ encapsulates different aspects of conﬁguration that needs
to be done: sensor embedded software, intermediate devices, and cloud (middleware) software. In reference to
the scenario we presented in Section 4, sensors in Mike’s new refrigerator need to be conﬁgured autonomously
so they can communicate with the SP. Such an approach needs to deal with challenges such as heterogeneity:
sensor types (e.g. RFID, temperature), protocols and communications technologies (e.g. Wi-Fi, Zigbee). In
addition, once a deal is done, sensor behaviour need to be conﬁgured according to the agreement between the
sensor consumer and the sensor owner (e.g. sampling rate, data communication frequency and so on). Further,
SPs and ESPs may need to conﬁgure their cloud software accordingly. The sensing as a service model is a
distributed system. It is critical to utilise computational devices with different capabilities and capacities (e.g.
sensors, mobile phones, Raspberry Pi, laptops, servers) [39]. Another challenge is to ensure the interoperability
among different sensor hardware and cloud solutions. Complying with common standards in key areas in
the architecture (such as communication interfaces and data formats) is critical. Energy conservation is also
a challenge that needs to be addressed across all the entities in the model due to the large scale and the resource
restricted nature of the sensors. Other than the sensor data, it is important to capture context information (e.g.
battery level of the sensors, redundant sensors, access to energy sources, accuracy, reliability) as well [21].
Context information allows to design optimized sensing schedules and strategies that ensure the sustainability
of the IoT infrastructure.

• Standardization is the key to interoperability. We have experienced the value of interoperability in service
computing and many other occasions throughout the history of computing. Standardization efforts need to
be carried out as early as possible to avoid signiﬁcant frustrations and costs that may occur at later stages.
Technology needs ensure the accuracy of the data up to an acceptable level as it is one of the main motivations
behind the Sensing as a service model. It is important to anonymize the sensor data collected. Sensitive
information such as location need to be implicitly altered to protect the sensor owner privacy. This should
be done in both the hardware and software levels. For the hardware level, we need to develop next generation
security appliance that can be used to anonymize data at the ground level (i.e. physically close to the sensor
owners). Techniques similar to privacy preserving data sharing ad matching [40] need to be developed in order
to combine sensor data to anonymize entities / proﬁles (excluding sensitive data) later at the server level.

• The sensing as a service model will collect enormous amount of data that need to be processed and understood.
It will open up opportunities for thousands of new businesses. The entry barriers need to be kept at a minimum
to stimulate new start-ups to be established to provide more value added services (e.g. search sensors based
on context information [26] and user requirements [28]). The opportunities are ranging from the point where
data is collected and to the point data is delivered. As we argued earlier, most of the users who may consume
sensor data will not have technical expertise. Therefore, understanding data and extract valuable information
from sensor data, by data fusing and reasoning, can also provide value added services.

• The sensing as a service model promotes a healthy competition among parties involved as it helps both the sensor
data owners and sensor data consumers. Sustainability needs to be ensured by having a fair and transparent
ﬁnancial model which motivates all the parties to be retained in the business. Sensor data and knowledge
produced using them need to be accurate and credible so consumers can make important and potentially costly
strategic decisions based on them.

• Trust and social acceptance in vital towards the adaptation of the sensing as a service model. If sensor owners
do not trust the sensing as a service, the entire model will fail. In order to win the trust, a long term change
management process is required. It needs to be supported by increasing the awareness about inner-workings
and beneﬁts of the model. New privacy protection and security protocols [41] need to be introduced in order to
make the model sustainable by winning the trust of all parties involved.

• Security and privacy is a must [42]. It needs to be implemented in number of levels. First, at the technology level,
secondly, in government and business policy level and ﬁnally, through strict legal terms and conditions. Policies
need to be set in order to keep the accessibility fairly open to the sensor data consumers while validating and
monitoring all the parties involved in the model. Maximum usability at both ends (the sensor owner and sensor
data consumer end) helps the model to be adopted by the wider community. Automated sensor conﬁguration
plays a signiﬁcant role in usability because most of the sensor owner will be non-technical.

ABSTRACT

The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world’s population
thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of
resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efﬁcient city management
has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to ﬁnd
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained signiﬁcant attention over the
past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efﬁcient and effective
resource management in Smart Cities. Today infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it ﬁts with the Internet of
Things. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical, and social
perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues. Copyright c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Smart Cities (SC) [2]
are recent phenomena that have attracted the attention from
both academia and industry. While both ideas consolidate
similar ideology, they have different origins. Both IoT
and SC do not have clear and concise deﬁnitions due to
their short history and broadness. Examining the origins of
both ideas in brief allows us to understand their potentials.
Even though the term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined
in 1999 [3], the technologies that enable IoT such as
sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
we brieﬂy review the trend of everything as service in
Section 2. In Section 3, the sensing as a service model
is presented. Subsequently, we explain the sensing as a
service model using a futuristic scenario in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss several use case scenarios that
highlight the different aspects of the sensing as a service
model. Advantages in sensing as a service model are
discussed in Section 6. Later, in Section 7, we highlight

process inefﬁcient. In XaaS, online retail applications are
hosted in servers facilitated by cloud service provider
where the business is only required to pay for the resource
it consumes. This model works similar to the utility
services such as electricity. Further, cloud computing
service models provide many other beneﬁts such as
business agility, scalability and elasticity, reliability, green
initiatives, less maintenance work including backup and
disaster recovery. Ultimately, XaaS allows businesses to
focus more on core competency and innovation instead of
ICT [14]. Further explanation on characteristics, features
and beneﬁts of cloud computing are presented in [12, 15].
trend
during the past decade. Various city councils, business
organizations, research and academic institutions, and the
governments have invested signiﬁcantly in projects to
study, design, and build solutions to address the problems
in urban cities using ICT. IBM Smart Planet and Smart
Cities, Oracle iGovernment, Amsterdam Smart City, Dubai
SmartCity, EuropeanSmartCities, and Smart Cities Future
are some of the leading Smart City projects [16, 17]. The
following statistics show the magnitude of both trends.
Global cloud computing and XaaS market is expected to
grow from $37.8 billion in 2010 to $121.1 billion by 2015,
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
26.2% from 2010 to 2015 [14]. Similarly, the global Smart
City market is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2016,
growing at a CAGR of 14.2% [18].

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in
detail. As depicted in Figure 3, the sensing as a service
model consists of four conceptual layers: 1) sensors and
sensor owners, 2) sensor publishers, 3) extended service
providers, and 4) sensor data consumers. In this section,
we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic
conceptual form. In Section 4, we present a real world
scenario based on this model. At the end of Section 4, we
map the real world scenario into the conceptual model in
order to provide a practical understanding.

Sensors and Sensor Owners Layer: This layer
consists of sensors and sensor owners. A sensor is a device
that detects, measures or sense a physical phenomenon
such as humidity, temperature, etc. [19]. Multiple sensors
can be attached to an object or device. For example,
microwaves or coffee machines may have sensors that
can be used to detect events (e.g. the number of times
it is used per day and related context information). Such

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

information can be used to understand user behaviour and
user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

shared between SPs if necessary depending on consumer
requirements. Even though all four categories perfom the
same task (i.e. sensor deployment and publication), the
decision making processes can be quite different especially
in term of objectives, ﬁnancial goals, approval processes,
privacy and policy concerns.

Sensor Publishers Layer: This layer consists of sensor
publishers (SP). The main responsibility of a sensor
publisher is to detect available sensors, communicate
with the sensor owners, and get permission to publish
the sensors in the cloud. Sensor publishers are separate
business entities. When a sensor owner
registers a
speciﬁc sensor, SP collects information about the sensor
availability, owner preferences and restriction, expected
return, etc. All this information needs to be published in
the cloud. Once the registration is done, a SP waits until
a sensor consumer makes a request. When a SP receives
such a request, it forwards all the details including the offer
to the corresponding sensor owner(s) to accept or reject.
If the sensor owner accepts the offer, the corresponding
sensor data consumer will be able to acquire data from
that sensor through the SP during the period mentioned
in the agreement (offer). The same interaction explained
above can take place between SPs and ESPs. SPs entirely
depend on the payments (e.g. commission) receives from
sensor owners, sensor data consumers or both. Xively
[22] is a public cloud for the IoT that simpliﬁes and
accelerates the creation, deployment, and management,
of sensors in scalable manner. Further, it allows sharing
sensor data with each other though it is far away from being
qualiﬁed as a SP we envisioned in the sensing as a service
model. The OpenIoT project [23] focuses on providing an
open source middleware framework enabling the dynamic
formulation of self-managed cloud environments for IoT
applications. Global Sensor Networks (GSN) [24] is a
middleware which supports sensor deployments and offers
a ﬂexible, zero-programming deployment and integration
infrastructure for IoT. These approaches strengthen our
vision towards sensing as a service.

Extended Service Providers Layer: This

layer
consists of extended service providers (ESP). This layer
can be considered as the most intelligent among all the
four layers which embed the intelligence to the entire
service model. The services provided by ESPs can be
varied widely from one provider to another. However,
there are some fundamental characteristics of ESPs. To
become an ESP, they have to provide value added services
[25] to the sensor data consumers. However, in some
instances a single business entity can perform both sensor
publisher and extended service provider roles. Each SP
has access (only) to the sensors which are registered with
it. When a sensor data consumer needs sensor data from
multiple sensors where each sensor has been registered
with different SPs, ESPs can be used to acquire data easily.
ESPs communicate with multiple SPs regarding sensor
data acquisition on behalf of the sensor data consumer.
The ESPs depend on the payments (e.g. commission)

Figure 4. Sensor classiﬁcation scheme based on ownership

The same process will occur when physical properties
(e.g. land, building) are sold from one party to another.
This category would be the second largest sensor owner
after the personal and household category.

• The public organizations and places category is similar
to the private organizations and places category we
discussed above. However, this category also includes
public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, parks,
etc. All the sensors deployed by the government will
be published in the cloud depending on government
policies.

• Commercial sensor data providers are business entities
who deploy and manage sensors by themselves by
keeping ownership. They earn by publishing the sensors
and sensor data they own through sensor publishers.
They may deploy sensors across all places such
as households, private and public owned properties
depending on demand and strategic value by also
complying with legal terms. Mostly, they will focus
on public and private places. They will also make a
payment to the property owner as an exchange for
giving permissions for sensor deployment. For example,
commercial sensor data provider may deploy sensors
in a children’s park owned by state government (under
government permission) to detect motion and measure
the micro climate (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
speed, wind direction). Such monitoring allows to
detect and predict potential crowd movements. The
sensor data that can be used to predict such movements
can be sold to sensor data consumers such as mobile
stall businesses and children’s product retailers who
may be located in nearby areas.

A sensor owner makes the ﬁnal decision on whether
to publish the sensors he owns in the cloud or not. If the
owner decides not to publish, no sensor publisher would
be able to get access to those sensors which signiﬁcantly
protect the security and privacy of the sensor owner. If the
sensor owner decides to publish the sensors he owns, he
needs to register himself with a sensor publisher. Sensor
owners can deﬁne restrictions and conditions such as who
can request permission and the expected return (offer). It
is important to note that each sensor may send data to
a different SP in the cloud (similar as we use Internet
service providers). However, a single sensor only sends
data to a single SP (in order to save energy). Data will be

Figure 5. A futuristic scenario that explains the interactions in sensing as a service model

similar to SPs. ESPs receive payments for the value
added service they provided to their customers (i.e. sensor
data consumers). An example value added service can be
selecting sensors based on customer’s requirements [26].
Customers will provide their requirements in high-level
(e.g. measure environmental pollution in Canberra) instead
of selecting the sensors by themselves. In return, ESP
will select the appropriate sensors (e.g. pH, temperature,
humidity, CO2, etc.) located in Canberra. Pinto et al. [27]
have proposed an architectural approach for telecoms to
take advantage of machine-to-machine markets in the IoT
domain. It explains the opportunities business can address
by providing services related to connectivity management,
data management, and service provisioning.

Sensor Data Consumers Layer: This layer consists
of sensor data consumers. All the sensor data consumers
need to register themselves and obtain a valid digital
certiﬁcate from an authority in order
to consume
sensor data. Some of the major sensor data consumers
would be governments, business organizations, academic
institutions, and scientiﬁc research communities. Sensor
data consumers do not directly communicate with sensors
or sensor owners. All the communication and transactions
need to be done through either SPs or ESPs. If a sensor
consumer has the required technical capability, they can
directly acquire data from sensor publishers. However,
this could be very challenging. For example, selecting
which sensors to use out of billions of sensors available
could be an overwhelming task [28]. Further, sensor data
consumers may need to communicate with multiple sensor
publishers to acquire the required data. However, the cost
of sensor data acquisition would be lower as they are not
required to pay for ESPs’ value added services. Scientiﬁc
research communities may be interested in such methods.
The sensor consumers with less technical capabilities
and expertise can acquire required sensor data through
ESPs where most of the difﬁcult tasks such as combining
sensor data from multiple sensor publishers and selecting
appropriate sensors based on the consumer requirements
are handled. Further, sensor consumers can register their

Trans. Emerging Tel. Tech. 2014; 00:1–12 c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/ett

interests with both SPs, and ESPs. For example, they can
express their interest by using a number of constraints.
A coffee manufacture who expects to starts its business
in Canberra may be interested to access the sensor data
produced by coffee machines located in Canberra for a
fee. Depending on the expression of interest, ESPs/SPs
will notify the coffee manufacturer when a matching deal
is available. In simple terms, sensor owners deﬁne what
they are expecting as return for the sensor data from one
end of the Sensing as a service model. On the other end,
sensor consumers deﬁne what kind of sensor data they
want and how much are they willing to pay (offer). SPs and
ESPs are platforms that enable these transactions (deals) to
take place. The sensing as a service model shares common
characteristics of an auction [29].

4. THE FUTURE: A SCENARIO

A futuristic scenario can be used to explain the sensing
as a service model. The scenario illustrated in Figure 5 is
based on smart home domain which also plays a signiﬁcant
role in the Smart Cities. Our intention is to highlight the
interactions between different parties explained earlier in
high-level.

Mike bought a new refrigerator for his new home.
He brought it home and plugged it to the power. The
fridge automatically identiﬁes the availability of Wi-Fi in
the house as shown in step (1). Further, the refrigerator
communicates with a sensor publisher and informs about
its presence by providing information such as the available
sensors (e.g. RFID reader, temperature, door sensors) as
shown in step (2). Next, in step (3), the SP communicates
with Mike to check whether he likes to publish the sensors
attached to the refrigerator in the cloud (step 3). We
assume that Mike has already registered with the SP in
a previous transaction. Mike is allowed to deﬁne which
sensors to publish, what kind of consumers are allowed
to bid, and what kind of return (fee or any other offer) is
expected. Later, Mike receives an email from a company

ice cream manufacturer, with an offer as shown in step
(4). DairyIceCream is interested to have access to the
RFID reader and the door sensor attached to the freezer in
Mike’s refrigerator. As a return, DairyIceCream is willing
to offer either 3% discount on every product purchased
from DairyIceCream or a monthly fee of $2. As Mike likes
DairyIceCream products, he agrees to the 3% discount
offer instead of the monthly fee as shown in step (5).
A week later, Mike receives an email from a company
called ProductiveAnalytics which has been sent on behalf
of the GoldenCheese company, a cheese manufacturer,
with an similar offer. This request also comes through
EasySensing. However, the offer is either 4% discount on
every product purchase by GoldenCheese or a monthly fee
of $1. As Mike does not like GoldenCheese products, he
decides to accept the monthly fee option.

represent

Scenario from model perspective: In Section 3, we
explained the sensing as a service model in a generic
perspective and now we describe it from the above
mentioned scenario perspective. In the scenario, Mike
is the sensor owner. Therefore, he and his sensors
represent the sensors and sensor owners layer. Further,
in ownership categorization, Mike represents the Personal
and households scheme. Both the DairyIceCream and
GoldenCheese companies
the sensor data
consumers layer. EasySensing is a SP who enables the
communication and transactions between Mike and the
DairyIceCream. EasySensing is responsible for matching
the sensor owners expectations with the requirements of
sensor data consumers. DairyIceCream retrieves the data
from EasySensing directly and conducts the data analysis
with the help of in-house experts. ProductiveAnalytics
is an ESP who works on behalf of GoldenCheese.
GoldenCheese has hired ProductiveAnalytics to perform
the data analysis as they do not have the required technical
skills within the company. ProductiveAnalytics collects the
data by handling all the deals and transaction with the
sensor owners though their partner SPs.

5. SENSING AS A SERVICE IN ACTION

In the previous section, we discussed a scenario related to
the smart home domain in sensing as a service perspective.
This section presents three different use case scenarios
that explain different aspects of the sensing as a service
model: (1) waste management, (2) smart agriculture, and
(3) environmental management. All three scenarios share
common a sets of characteristics as well as few unique
characteristics. Waste management has a direct impact on
cities. Environmental management has direct, indirect, and
long term impact on the entire human life-cycle both in
urban and rural living. Further, smart agriculture makes
indirect impact on sustainability towards the smart cities.

5.1. Waste Management

Waste management is one of the toughest challenge that
modern cities have to deal with. Waste management
consists of different processes such as collection, transport,
processing, disposal, managing, and monitoring of waste
materials. These processes cost signiﬁcant amount of
money, time, and labour. Optimizing waste management
processes help to save money that can be used to address
other challenges that smart cities need to deal with. In
Figure 6, we illustrate how the sensing as a service model
works in the waste management domain. In a modern
smart city, there are several parties who are interested in
waste management (e.g. city council, recycling companies,
manufacturing plants, and authorities related to health
and safety). Instead of deploying sensors and collecting
information independently, the sensing as a service model
allows all the interest groups to share the infrastructure
and bare the related costs collectively. The most important
aspect of such a collaboration is the cost reduction
that individual groups need to spend otherwise. All the
interested parties can retrieve and process sensor data in
real time in order to achieve their own objective. The cost
depends on the data requirement of the interest group.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

For example, a city council may use sensor data to
develop optimized garbage collection strategies, so they
can save fuel cost related to garbage trucks. Additionally,
recycling companies can use sensor data to predict and
track the amount of waste coming into their plants to be
processed so they can optimize their internal processes.
Further, health and safety authorities can monitor and
supervise the waste management process without spending
substantial amount of money for manual monitoring
inspections. The phenomenon of sharing sensor data using
a sensing as a service model creates a synergy effect (i.e.
interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce
an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects).
The sensing as a service model ensures the long term
sustainability of the IoT infrastructure.

the sensing as a service model

Let us discuss how this technology can be used to
support
in ﬁnancially
viable manner. In order to perform waste management,
different types of sensors need to be deployed in different
places such as garbage cans and trucks. These sensors
need to detect information such as the amount of garbage,
types of garbage, and so on. As we have depicted in
Figure 6, direct and indirect communication strategies
can be used to collect and communicate sensor data to
the cloud. Sensors with energy harvesting capabilities
are important
in this domain [30]. As represented in
step (1) in Figure 6, low powered [31] and low capable
sensors can be used to sense and data can be uploaded
to the cloud with the help of nearby infrastructure (e.g.
through communication devices attached to street lights
or similar infrastructure that have access to rich energy
sources and communication capabilities). Additionally,
when long range communication is not available, data can
be uploaded to the cloud with the help of auto-mobiles, as
depicted in step (2) in Figure 6, such as garbage trucks,
city council vehicles, buses that operate in the areas and
so on. Furthermore, both active and passive sensors can be
used to sense the environment [32]. Direct communication
can be done via technologies such as 3G which makes this
approach less dependant on third parties (as depicted in (3)
in Figure 6).

5.2. Smart Agriculture

Currently, the authors are actively involved in designing
and developing open platforms for sensor data collection,
processing and sharing in the domain of agriculture
through two projects: Phenonet [33] and OpenIoT [23].
In this scenario, the general public is not directly involved
as in the smart home domain. In Figure 7, we illustrate
how the sensing as a service model works in the smart
agriculture domain. Agriculture is an importation part of
smart cities as it contributes to the food supply-chain that
facilitates a large number of communities concentrated
into cities.

The sensing as a service model allows to conduct
scientiﬁc research and exploration more efﬁciently
and efﬁciently. Further, it opens up different research

Figure 7. Efﬁcient and effective collaborative research sup-

ported by sensing as a service model

opportunities which are unlikely to occurr in a traditional
research model. Let us explain the Phenonet project in
details and the applicability of the sensing as a service
model towards agricultural research. Phenonet describes
the network of sensors collecting information over a
ﬁeld of experimental crops. Researchers at
the High
Resolution Plant Phenomics Centre are testing a network
of smart sensor nodes able to monitor plant growth and
performance information and climate conditions. Even
though the main research goal of deploying sensors
and collecting data is to understand plant growth under
different climate conditions,
the same set of sensors
can be utilized to perform a verity of different research
activities in different domains. The data can be shared
among different research organizations and institutions
located around the world. Due to limited funding, most
of these research institutions may not be able to maintain
large scale sensor deployments (e.g. academic institutions,
specially in developing countries). However, the sensing
as a service model allows all these interest groups, who
are unable to set-up their own sensor deployments, to
perform research using actual data with signiﬁcantly less
costs. Further, the sensing as a service model creates

opportunities across different domains. For example, the
above mentioned sensor data can be used to understand
pest control and related phenomenon. Additionally they
can be used to understand soil conditions where bio-
scientist may be interested. More importantly, the sensing
as a service model allows researchers to share resources
across borders and understand phenomenon which are not
available in their own countries.

5.3. Environmental Management

This domain has the unique ability of utilizing existing
sensors that are deployed for different reasons. Most
of the sensors used in environmental monitoring are
commonly used in other domains such as climate, wild
ﬁre detection, and structural health monitoring. Using
the sensing as a service model,
interest groups can
acquire relevant sensor data without deploying sensors by
themselves. Further, environmental management is a large
domain where a single organization cannot deal with (e.g.
wild ﬁre). A model like sensing as a service stimulates
innovative solutions that use the same data but produce
different results using different processing and analysing
techniques (e.g. prediction, visualization, simulation). As
we discussed in Section 3, ESPs can help the sensor data
consumers to orchestrate existing services into different
data processing [34] and analysis work-ﬂows [35].

6. ADVANTAGES AND BENEFITS

Some of the major advantages and beneﬁts in the sensing
as a service model are discussed below:
• Built-in cloud computing: It is modelled around cloud
computing. Therefore, it inherits all the beneﬁts of
the fundamental cloud computing models such as
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Scalable and widely accessible
processing and storage resources are available to
facilitate sensing as a service software platforms (SPs
and ESPs). Sensor data consumers only need to pay for
the data they use. Therefore, the cost of data acquisition
reduces signiﬁcantly due to sharing, participatory /
crowd sourcing, and reusing nature (i.e. sense once and
use by many).

• Participatory sensing: The workload is distributed
among different players in the model. This enables
rapid deployment of sensors across wider geographical
locations that capture various phenomena.

• Sharing and reusing: In traditional methods, each party
(group or person) who wants to collect sensor data
needs to visit the ﬁeld and deploy the sensors manually
by themselves. Further, there is no easy way to share
sensor data collected by one party with others. Sensing
as a service is a model that stimulates by concept
of sharing. In simple terms, if someone has already
deployed the sensors, others can have access to them

8

by paying a fee to the sensor owner. One of the
major arguments that could arise regarding sensing as a
service model is that “How to convince a manufacturer
to embed sensors and communication capabilities into
devices we use in everyday life (e.g refrigerator in the
use-case presented in Section 4)”. This question can be
answered in two different perspectives.
First, IoT envisions to have sensor embedded into
objects around us. The goal of IoT is to allow devices
to communicate with each other. Naturally, such a goal
forces next generation devices to be embedded with rich
sensing and communication capabilities. Therefore,
the motivation is given to the manufacturers not by
the sensing as a service model but
the vision of
IoT. The sensing as a service model is designed to
provide incentives to users which motivate them to
purchase next generation devices that supports both
IoT envisioned interactions as well as the sensing as a
service model. The additional cost that contributes to
increase the prices of the devices (due to embedding
rich sensing and communication capabilities) can be
easily covered by participating in the sensing as a
service model
itself. Even today, state of the art
devices such as refrigerators and televisions comprise
communication and sensing capabilities.

• Reduction of data acquisition cost: Due to the shared
and collaborative nature, data acquisition cost will
be reduced signiﬁcantly. Such a sustainable business
model stimulates more and more sensor deployments.
Further, technological advances and higher demands
allow to produce sensors in mass volumes using cheap
materials by reducing the cost per unit. Further, this
helps to collect data from sensors which was impossible
previously.

• Collect data previously unavailable: This model allows
to collect sensor data which is impossible to collect
using traditional non-collaborative methods. This
business model promotes and stimulates the sensor
deployments by companies at commercial level. As
we explained earlier in Section 3, dedicated business
entities will deploy sensors in public places such
as parks and bridges so government authorities can
have access to those sensors by paying only for
the data they need in real-time or archived. Today
business entities spend substantial amount of money
to conduct market analyses and consumer surveys.
A sample of 1,000 respondents, which would give a
statistical accuracy of +/-3.1% costs around $8,000
[36]. Recently, different third party companies started
offering consumer surveys on behalf of businesses.
One such solution is Google Consumer Surveys
(www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys). Google
Consumer Surveys allows businesses to target user
groups with speciﬁc criteria and conduct the survey.
Currently, one user response cost around $0.10, 1/10th
of the cost of similar quality research conduct using
traditional methods.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

Even though such approaches have reduced the cost
of surveys, they still have deﬁciencies such as latency,
inaccuracies, and so on. In the sensing as a service
model, all the data is directly coming from the sensor
without user intervention. This also helps to reduce the
cost of data acquisition. Due to privacy concerns it is
important to anonymise the sensor data collected. We
discuss privacy matters later. In the smart home scenario
we discussed in Section 4, we explained how a single
sensor attached to a refrigerator, and cheap passive
RFID tags attached to consumer products, produce
valuable information of consumer behaviour that can be
used by thousand of companies. This drastically reduces
the consumer survey cost as well as pay off the cost of
attaching sensors to the products.

• Innovations: Due to a reduction in sensor data acquisition
cost, larger number of interest groups will be able
to access to them. Further, the availability of sensor
data which was not available previously can also
signiﬁcantly stimulate innovation . Sensing as a service
model itself provides space for innovation in the ESP
layer. The cloud-based value added services provided
in the ESP layer allows the sensor data consumers
to achieve their objective easily and faster in many
different application domains.

• Applications: Easily accessible sensor data allows
government authorities, academia, research institutions,
and businesses to address different challenges in
Smart Cities such as trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
and unemployment, health, and crime management.
For example, accurate data on energy consumption
in a city allows managing electric grids efﬁciently
by analysing and predicting energy consumption
behaviours, patterns, future trends, and needs.

• Real-time data for decision making and policy making:
This model enables collecting sensor data in real-
time, from a variety of different domains, which
facilitates the decision making processes. Such data is
expensive to collect and usually unavailable for decision
making in traditional sensor deploying environments.
For example, data collected from sensors deployed in
vehicles and roads allow the authorities to monitor
and manage trafﬁc in real-time. Further, sensor data
collected over a period of time (archived) can be used
to make policy decisions. For example, trafﬁc data over
a period on a speciﬁc city will help a city governance
to make long term strategic decisions such as whether
to invest on a tram service across the city or not. In
addition to the points discussed above, there are many
other direct and indirect beneﬁts in the sensing as a
service model.

• Direct and indirect beneﬁts: The sensing as a service
model creates a win-win situation for all the parties
involved. Based on the scenario we presented in Section
4, Mike (sensor owners’ perspective) is getting a
return (a valuable offer). In DairyIceCream perspective,

Trans. Emerging Tel. Tech. 2014; 00:1–12 c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/ett
Prepared using ettauth.cls

now they have real-time data about product consumer
behaviour (e.g. when Mike eats ice cream, how frequent,
whether Mike use substitutions and so on). Therefore,
DairyIceCream is no longer required to conduct manual
surveys and market analyses.

• Privacy preservation: Finally and more importantly,
this model provide complete control of the privacy of
sensor owners in their own hands. The ﬁnal decision
of whether to publish their sensors or not is taken
by the sensor owners. It allows the sensor owners
to control and protect their privacy. Additionally, the
sensing as a service model needs to be supported by
anonymization techniques. For example, lets consider
security and privacy challenges [37] related to the smart
home scenario we presented in Section 4. During the
conﬁguration process, it is important to identify the
information and preferences related to Mike. In order
to protect
the privacy of the users, SPs and ESPs
should not provide personal information to the sensor
data consumers. Such approach helps to preserve user
privacy. Additionally, once the deal between the sensor
owner, sensor consumer and the sensor provider is
done, data retrieves from Mike’s sensors should be
explicitly anonymized. It is important to develop new
algorithms and security devices that can anonymize
sensitive information (such as exact location).

7. OPEN CHALLENGES

The sensing as a service model can contribute signiﬁcantly
to address the challenges in the IoT and SC. There are
many open challenges and issues that need to be tackled.
We identify some of the major challenges in the sensing
as a service model under three categories in Table I:
technological, economical, and social, where some can
be discussed under multiple categories. Each of these
challenges shows research directions for future work in the
sensing as a service domain.

8. CONCLUSIONS

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
sensing as a service model and its applicability towards
Smart Cities in the Internet of Things paradigm. Our
vision is backed up by a number of projects initiated
around the globe, including FP7 ICT project OpenIoT [23].
We discussed the model from three different perspectives
including technological, economical, and social. We
examined how the sensing as a service can be a sustainable,
scalable, and powerful model. The sensing as a service
model allows utilizing resources efﬁciently so limited
resource can be used to accommodate large numbers of
consumers. Further, it also creates a win-win situation for
all the parties involved. We identiﬁed a number of major

and issues

Description, signiﬁcance, and research directions to address the challenges

• Technology plays the most important role in enabling the sensing as a service model. This model uses the same
infrastructure that IoT envisions. Therefore, most of the technological solutions that are developed to facilitate
sensing as a service can be used to realize the vision of IoT. The sensing as a service model is expected to
facilitate billions of sensors and parallel sensor data streams. A major challenge is to develop middleware
solutions that allow to handle such demand [23]. Similarly, this model needs signiﬁcant improvements in data
communication bandwidth [38] over the existing infrastructure (e.g. ﬁber). Another major challenge is the
sensor conﬁguration. The term ‘sensor conﬁguration’ encapsulates different aspects of conﬁguration that needs
to be done: sensor embedded software, intermediate devices, and cloud (middleware) software. In reference to
the scenario we presented in Section 4, sensors in Mike’s new refrigerator need to be conﬁgured autonomously
so they can communicate with the SP. Such an approach needs to deal with challenges such as heterogeneity:
sensor types (e.g. RFID, temperature), protocols and communications technologies (e.g. Wi-Fi, Zigbee). In
addition, once a deal is done, sensor behaviour need to be conﬁgured according to the agreement between the
sensor consumer and the sensor owner (e.g. sampling rate, data communication frequency and so on). Further,
SPs and ESPs may need to conﬁgure their cloud software accordingly. The sensing as a service model is a
distributed system. It is critical to utilise computational devices with different capabilities and capacities (e.g.
sensors, mobile phones, Raspberry Pi, laptops, servers) [39]. Another challenge is to ensure the interoperability
among different sensor hardware and cloud solutions. Complying with common standards in key areas in
the architecture (such as communication interfaces and data formats) is critical. Energy conservation is also
a challenge that needs to be addressed across all the entities in the model due to the large scale and the resource
restricted nature of the sensors. Other than the sensor data, it is important to capture context information (e.g.
battery level of the sensors, redundant sensors, access to energy sources, accuracy, reliability) as well [21].
Context information allows to design optimized sensing schedules and strategies that ensure the sustainability
of the IoT infrastructure.

• Standardization is the key to interoperability. We have experienced the value of interoperability in service
computing and many other occasions throughout the history of computing. Standardization efforts need to
be carried out as early as possible to avoid signiﬁcant frustrations and costs that may occur at later stages.
Technology needs ensure the accuracy of the data up to an acceptable level as it is one of the main motivations
behind the Sensing as a service model. It is important to anonymize the sensor data collected. Sensitive
information such as location need to be implicitly altered to protect the sensor owner privacy. This should
be done in both the hardware and software levels. For the hardware level, we need to develop next generation
security appliance that can be used to anonymize data at the ground level (i.e. physically close to the sensor
owners). Techniques similar to privacy preserving data sharing ad matching [40] need to be developed in order
to combine sensor data to anonymize entities / proﬁles (excluding sensitive data) later at the server level.

• The sensing as a service model will collect enormous amount of data that need to be processed and understood.
It will open up opportunities for thousands of new businesses. The entry barriers need to be kept at a minimum
to stimulate new start-ups to be established to provide more value added services (e.g. search sensors based
on context information [26] and user requirements [28]). The opportunities are ranging from the point where
data is collected and to the point data is delivered. As we argued earlier, most of the users who may consume
sensor data will not have technical expertise. Therefore, understanding data and extract valuable information
from sensor data, by data fusing and reasoning, can also provide value added services.

• The sensing as a service model promotes a healthy competition among parties involved as it helps both the sensor
data owners and sensor data consumers. Sustainability needs to be ensured by having a fair and transparent
ﬁnancial model which motivates all the parties to be retained in the business. Sensor data and knowledge
produced using them need to be accurate and credible so consumers can make important and potentially costly
strategic decisions based on them.

• Trust and social acceptance in vital towards the adaptation of the sensing as a service model. If sensor owners
do not trust the sensing as a service, the entire model will fail. In order to win the trust, a long term change
management process is required. It needs to be supported by increasing the awareness about inner-workings
and beneﬁts of the model. New privacy protection and security protocols [41] need to be introduced in order to
make the model sustainable by winning the trust of all parties involved.

• Security and privacy is a must [42]. It needs to be implemented in number of levels. First, at the technology level,
secondly, in government and business policy level and ﬁnally, through strict legal terms and conditions. Policies
need to be set in order to keep the accessibility fairly open to the sensor data consumers while validating and
monitoring all the parties involved in the model. Maximum usability at both ends (the sensor owner and sensor
data consumer end) helps the model to be adopted by the wider community. Automated sensor conﬁguration
plays a signiﬁcant role in usability because most of the sensor owner will be non-technical.

ABSTRACT

The world population is growing at a rapid pace. Towns and cities are accommodating half of the world’s population
thereby creating tremendous pressure on every aspect of urban living. Cities are known to have large concentration of
resources and facilities. Such environments attract people from rural areas. However, unprecedented attraction has now
become an overwhelming issue for city governance and politics. The enormous pressure towards efﬁcient city management
has triggered various Smart City initiatives by both government and private sector businesses to invest in ICT to ﬁnd
sustainable solutions to the growing issues. The Internet of Things (IoT) has also gained signiﬁcant attention over the
past decade. IoT envisions to connect billions of sensors to the Internet and expects to use them for efﬁcient and effective
resource management in Smart Cities. Today infrastructure, platforms, and software applications are offered as services
using cloud technologies. In this paper, we explore the concept of sensing as a service and how it ﬁts with the Internet of
Things. Our objective is to investigate the concept of sensing as a service model in technological, economical, and social
perspectives and identify the major open challenges and issues. Copyright c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] and Smart Cities (SC) [2]
are recent phenomena that have attracted the attention from
both academia and industry. While both ideas consolidate
similar ideology, they have different origins. Both IoT
and SC do not have clear and concise deﬁnitions due to
their short history and broadness. Examining the origins of
both ideas in brief allows us to understand their potentials.
Even though the term ‘Internet of Things’ was coined
in 1999 [3], the technologies that enable IoT such as
sensor networks existed since the 1990s. Due to the
advances in sensor and cloud technology, processing and
storage capability, and decreased sensor production cost,
the growth of sensor deployments has increased over
the last ﬁve years [4]. The European Commission has
predicted that by 2020, there will be 50 to 100 billion
devices connected to the Internet [5]. According to Figure
1, the number of things connected to the Internet exceeded
the number of people on earth in 2008.

By deﬁnition, IoT allows people and things to be
connected anytime, anyplace, with anything and anyone,
ideally using any path/network and any service [6]. As
we can observe, IoT is primarily driven by technological
advances, not by the applications or user needs. In

contrast, SC [7] originated to solve the problems in
modern cities. As a result of rural migration and suburban
concentration towards cities, the urban living has become
a signiﬁcant challenge to both citizens and to the
city governance. Waste, trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
unemployment, health, and crime management are some
of the critical issues [8]. SC are expected to address these
challenges efﬁciently and effectively using information
and communication technologies (ICT). By deﬁnition,
Smart Cities have six characteristics: smart economy,
smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart
environment and smart living [9]. As illustrated in Figure
2, SC and IoT, which have different origins, are moving
towards each other to achieve a common goal. We believe
that the sensing as a service model resides in between these
two with many other technological and business models.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
we brieﬂy review the trend of everything as service in
Section 2. In Section 3, the sensing as a service model
is presented. Subsequently, we explain the sensing as a
service model using a futuristic scenario in Section 4.
In Section 5, we discuss several use case scenarios that
highlight the different aspects of the sensing as a service
model. Advantages in sensing as a service model are
discussed in Section 6. Later, in Section 7, we highlight

process inefﬁcient. In XaaS, online retail applications are
hosted in servers facilitated by cloud service provider
where the business is only required to pay for the resource
it consumes. This model works similar to the utility
services such as electricity. Further, cloud computing
service models provide many other beneﬁts such as
business agility, scalability and elasticity, reliability, green
initiatives, less maintenance work including backup and
disaster recovery. Ultimately, XaaS allows businesses to
focus more on core competency and innovation instead of
ICT [14]. Further explanation on characteristics, features
and beneﬁts of cloud computing are presented in [12, 15].
trend
during the past decade. Various city councils, business
organizations, research and academic institutions, and the
governments have invested signiﬁcantly in projects to
study, design, and build solutions to address the problems
in urban cities using ICT. IBM Smart Planet and Smart
Cities, Oracle iGovernment, Amsterdam Smart City, Dubai
SmartCity, EuropeanSmartCities, and Smart Cities Future
are some of the leading Smart City projects [16, 17]. The
following statistics show the magnitude of both trends.
Global cloud computing and XaaS market is expected to
grow from $37.8 billion in 2010 to $121.1 billion by 2015,
growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of
26.2% from 2010 to 2015 [14]. Similarly, the global Smart
City market is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2016,
growing at a CAGR of 14.2% [18].

3. SENSING AS A SERVICE MODEL

Previously, we introduced the sensing as a service model as
a solution based on IoT infrastructure. It has the capability
to address the challenges in Smart Cities. As a result of
getting 50 billion things connected to the Internet by 2020,
there will be many sensors available that can be used. Even
today, many everyday objects are embedded with sensors
though the usage is restricted to the object itself. Let us
discuss the sensing as a service model and architecture in
detail. As depicted in Figure 3, the sensing as a service
model consists of four conceptual layers: 1) sensors and
sensor owners, 2) sensor publishers, 3) extended service
providers, and 4) sensor data consumers. In this section,
we explain the sensing as a service model in a generic
conceptual form. In Section 4, we present a real world
scenario based on this model. At the end of Section 4, we
map the real world scenario into the conceptual model in
order to provide a practical understanding.

Sensors and Sensor Owners Layer: This layer
consists of sensors and sensor owners. A sensor is a device
that detects, measures or sense a physical phenomenon
such as humidity, temperature, etc. [19]. Multiple sensors
can be attached to an object or device. For example,
microwaves or coffee machines may have sensors that
can be used to detect events (e.g. the number of times
it is used per day and related context information). Such

some of the major open challenges and issues related to
sensing as a service model. Open challenges are identiﬁed
under three main categories: technological, economical,
and social. Finally, we present the concluding remarks in
Section 8.

2. THE TRENDS: EVERYTHING AS A

SERVICE

Everything as a service (XaaS) [11] is a category of
models introduced with cloud computing [12]. Similar to
IoT, cloud computing also has a short history. It became
popular with a number of industry initiatives such as
Salesforce.com (1999) and Amazon Web Service (2002).
The basic idea behind cloud computing is to concentrate
resources such as hardware and software into few physical
locations and offer those resources as services to a large
number of consumers who are located in many different
geographical locations around the globe over the Internet
in an efﬁcient manner. There are three major service
models that are closely bound to cloud computing from its
initial stage: infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-
as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS). The
commonality among these models is that they all provide
resources as a service. With the popularity of these models,
several similar type models are also proposed. The service
models offered in cloud computing are discussed in [13]
with popular industry based examples.

Let us brieﬂy discuss the reasons behind the success
of everything as a service model in the cloud paradigm.
One major reason is the cost effectiveness. XaaS model
promotes the ‘pay as you go’ method or in other terms
‘pay only for what you use’. This allows the consumers to
consume a service from a service provider by paying only
for the amount of resources they use. This is an efﬁcient
way compared to the traditional methods of consuming
resources where consumers need to buy resources in
predeﬁned discreet quantities with higher expenses. For
example, consider a retail online business which has peak
and off-peak seasons. In traditional method, the business
has to buy signiﬁcant amount of compute servers (and
other resources) to facilitate the customer needs during
the peak season. However, these resources become idle
during the off-peak season which makes the business

information can be used to understand user behaviour and
user preferences more accurately. A road may have sensors
that can detect the weather and trafﬁc conditions. Today,
large varieties of different sensors are available. They
are capable of measuring a broad range of phenomena
[20]. Further, they have the capability to send sensor
data to the cloud. On the other hand, a sensor owner
has the ownership of a speciﬁc sensor at a given time.
Ownership may change over time. We classify sensors
into four categories based on ownership as depicted in
Figure 4: personal and household, private organizations
/ places, public organizations / places, and commercial
sensor data providers. In addition to sensor data, related
context information also has a signiﬁcant value [21].

• All personal

items, such as mobile phones, wrist
watches, spectacles, laptops, soft drinks, food items
and household items, such as televisions, cameras,
microwaves, washing machines belong to the personal
and household category. In simple terms, all items
(and also all sensors) not own by private or public

organizations belong to this category. We expect that all
of these items (also called things, objects, and devices)
would be equipped with sensors in the future.

• The private organizations and places category consists
of all items own by private organizations. The same
items we listed under personal and household category
can be listed under here as well depending on the
ownership. If a private company owns a coffee machine
and a microwave which cannot be attributed to a
single person, then those items can be listed under this
category. Therefore, the private business organization
has the right to take the decision whether to publish
the sensors attached to those items to the cloud or not.
As another example, if a private business organization
owns a sport complex or a hospital, all the sensors
deployed in those properties are also owned by them.
When a company manufactures and sells a product
that comprises sensors, the ownership get transferred
to that customer. As a result, a customer will decide
whether to publish those sensors in the cloud or not.

shared between SPs if necessary depending on consumer
requirements. Even though all four categories perfom the
same task (i.e. sensor deployment and publication), the
decision making processes can be quite different especially
in term of objectives, ﬁnancial goals, approval processes,
privacy and policy concerns.

Sensor Publishers Layer: This layer consists of sensor
publishers (SP). The main responsibility of a sensor
publisher is to detect available sensors, communicate
with the sensor owners, and get permission to publish
the sensors in the cloud. Sensor publishers are separate
business entities. When a sensor owner
registers a
speciﬁc sensor, SP collects information about the sensor
availability, owner preferences and restriction, expected
return, etc. All this information needs to be published in
the cloud. Once the registration is done, a SP waits until
a sensor consumer makes a request. When a SP receives
such a request, it forwards all the details including the offer
to the corresponding sensor owner(s) to accept or reject.
If the sensor owner accepts the offer, the corresponding
sensor data consumer will be able to acquire data from
that sensor through the SP during the period mentioned
in the agreement (offer). The same interaction explained
above can take place between SPs and ESPs. SPs entirely
depend on the payments (e.g. commission) receives from
sensor owners, sensor data consumers or both. Xively
[22] is a public cloud for the IoT that simpliﬁes and
accelerates the creation, deployment, and management,
of sensors in scalable manner. Further, it allows sharing
sensor data with each other though it is far away from being
qualiﬁed as a SP we envisioned in the sensing as a service
model. The OpenIoT project [23] focuses on providing an
open source middleware framework enabling the dynamic
formulation of self-managed cloud environments for IoT
applications. Global Sensor Networks (GSN) [24] is a
middleware which supports sensor deployments and offers
a ﬂexible, zero-programming deployment and integration
infrastructure for IoT. These approaches strengthen our
vision towards sensing as a service.

Extended Service Providers Layer: This

layer
consists of extended service providers (ESP). This layer
can be considered as the most intelligent among all the
four layers which embed the intelligence to the entire
service model. The services provided by ESPs can be
varied widely from one provider to another. However,
there are some fundamental characteristics of ESPs. To
become an ESP, they have to provide value added services
[25] to the sensor data consumers. However, in some
instances a single business entity can perform both sensor
publisher and extended service provider roles. Each SP
has access (only) to the sensors which are registered with
it. When a sensor data consumer needs sensor data from
multiple sensors where each sensor has been registered
with different SPs, ESPs can be used to acquire data easily.
ESPs communicate with multiple SPs regarding sensor
data acquisition on behalf of the sensor data consumer.
The ESPs depend on the payments (e.g. commission)

Figure 4. Sensor classiﬁcation scheme based on ownership

The same process will occur when physical properties
(e.g. land, building) are sold from one party to another.
This category would be the second largest sensor owner
after the personal and household category.

• The public organizations and places category is similar
to the private organizations and places category we
discussed above. However, this category also includes
public infrastructure such as bridges, roads, parks,
etc. All the sensors deployed by the government will
be published in the cloud depending on government
policies.

• Commercial sensor data providers are business entities
who deploy and manage sensors by themselves by
keeping ownership. They earn by publishing the sensors
and sensor data they own through sensor publishers.
They may deploy sensors across all places such
as households, private and public owned properties
depending on demand and strategic value by also
complying with legal terms. Mostly, they will focus
on public and private places. They will also make a
payment to the property owner as an exchange for
giving permissions for sensor deployment. For example,
commercial sensor data provider may deploy sensors
in a children’s park owned by state government (under
government permission) to detect motion and measure
the micro climate (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
speed, wind direction). Such monitoring allows to
detect and predict potential crowd movements. The
sensor data that can be used to predict such movements
can be sold to sensor data consumers such as mobile
stall businesses and children’s product retailers who
may be located in nearby areas.

A sensor owner makes the ﬁnal decision on whether
to publish the sensors he owns in the cloud or not. If the
owner decides not to publish, no sensor publisher would
be able to get access to those sensors which signiﬁcantly
protect the security and privacy of the sensor owner. If the
sensor owner decides to publish the sensors he owns, he
needs to register himself with a sensor publisher. Sensor
owners can deﬁne restrictions and conditions such as who
can request permission and the expected return (offer). It
is important to note that each sensor may send data to
a different SP in the cloud (similar as we use Internet
service providers). However, a single sensor only sends
data to a single SP (in order to save energy). Data will be

Figure 5. A futuristic scenario that explains the interactions in sensing as a service model

similar to SPs. ESPs receive payments for the value
added service they provided to their customers (i.e. sensor
data consumers). An example value added service can be
selecting sensors based on customer’s requirements [26].
Customers will provide their requirements in high-level
(e.g. measure environmental pollution in Canberra) instead
of selecting the sensors by themselves. In return, ESP
will select the appropriate sensors (e.g. pH, temperature,
humidity, CO2, etc.) located in Canberra. Pinto et al. [27]
have proposed an architectural approach for telecoms to
take advantage of machine-to-machine markets in the IoT
domain. It explains the opportunities business can address
by providing services related to connectivity management,
data management, and service provisioning.

Sensor Data Consumers Layer: This layer consists
of sensor data consumers. All the sensor data consumers
need to register themselves and obtain a valid digital
certiﬁcate from an authority in order
to consume
sensor data. Some of the major sensor data consumers
would be governments, business organizations, academic
institutions, and scientiﬁc research communities. Sensor
data consumers do not directly communicate with sensors
or sensor owners. All the communication and transactions
need to be done through either SPs or ESPs. If a sensor
consumer has the required technical capability, they can
directly acquire data from sensor publishers. However,
this could be very challenging. For example, selecting
which sensors to use out of billions of sensors available
could be an overwhelming task [28]. Further, sensor data
consumers may need to communicate with multiple sensor
publishers to acquire the required data. However, the cost
of sensor data acquisition would be lower as they are not
required to pay for ESPs’ value added services. Scientiﬁc
research communities may be interested in such methods.
The sensor consumers with less technical capabilities
and expertise can acquire required sensor data through
ESPs where most of the difﬁcult tasks such as combining
sensor data from multiple sensor publishers and selecting
appropriate sensors based on the consumer requirements
are handled. Further, sensor consumers can register their

DOI: 10.1002/ett
Prepared using ettauth.cls

interests with both SPs, and ESPs. For example, they can
express their interest by using a number of constraints.
A coffee manufacture who expects to starts its business
in Canberra may be interested to access the sensor data
produced by coffee machines located in Canberra for a
fee. Depending on the expression of interest, ESPs/SPs
will notify the coffee manufacturer when a matching deal
is available. In simple terms, sensor owners deﬁne what
they are expecting as return for the sensor data from one
end of the Sensing as a service model. On the other end,
sensor consumers deﬁne what kind of sensor data they
want and how much are they willing to pay (offer). SPs and
ESPs are platforms that enable these transactions (deals) to
take place. The sensing as a service model shares common
characteristics of an auction [29].

4. THE FUTURE: A SCENARIO

A futuristic scenario can be used to explain the sensing
as a service model. The scenario illustrated in Figure 5 is
based on smart home domain which also plays a signiﬁcant
role in the Smart Cities. Our intention is to highlight the
interactions between different parties explained earlier in
high-level.

Mike bought a new refrigerator for his new home.
He brought it home and plugged it to the power. The
fridge automatically identiﬁes the availability of Wi-Fi in
the house as shown in step (1). Further, the refrigerator
communicates with a sensor publisher and informs about
its presence by providing information such as the available
sensors (e.g. RFID reader, temperature, door sensors) as
shown in step (2). Next, in step (3), the SP communicates
with Mike to check whether he likes to publish the sensors
attached to the refrigerator in the cloud (step 3). We
assume that Mike has already registered with the SP in
a previous transaction. Mike is allowed to deﬁne which
sensors to publish, what kind of consumers are allowed
to bid, and what kind of return (fee or any other offer) is
expected. Later, Mike receives an email from a company

(4). DairyIceCream is interested to have access to the
RFID reader and the door sensor attached to the freezer in
Mike’s refrigerator. As a return, DairyIceCream is willing
to offer either 3% discount on every product purchased
from DairyIceCream or a monthly fee of $2. As Mike likes
DairyIceCream products, he agrees to the 3% discount
offer instead of the monthly fee as shown in step (5).
A week later, Mike receives an email from a company
called ProductiveAnalytics which has been sent on behalf
of the GoldenCheese company, a cheese manufacturer,
with an similar offer. This request also comes through
EasySensing. However, the offer is either 4% discount on
every product purchase by GoldenCheese or a monthly fee
of $1. As Mike does not like GoldenCheese products, he
decides to accept the monthly fee option.

Scenario from model perspective: In Section 3, we
explained the sensing as a service model in a generic
perspective and now we describe it from the above
mentioned scenario perspective. In the scenario, Mike
is the sensor owner. Therefore, he and his sensors

in ownership categorization, Mike represents the Personal
and households scheme. Both the DairyIceCream and
GoldenCheese companies
the sensor data
consumers layer. EasySensing is a SP who enables the
communication and transactions between Mike and the
DairyIceCream. EasySensing is responsible for matching
the sensor owners expectations with the requirements of
sensor data consumers. DairyIceCream retrieves the data
from EasySensing directly and conducts the data analysis
with the help of in-house experts. ProductiveAnalytics
is an ESP who works on behalf of GoldenCheese.
GoldenCheese has hired ProductiveAnalytics to perform
the data analysis as they do not have the required technical
skills within the company. ProductiveAnalytics collects the
data by handling all the deals and transaction with the
sensor owners though their partner SPs.

5. SENSING AS A SERVICE IN ACTION

In the previous section, we discussed a scenario related to
the smart home domain in sensing as a service perspective.
This section presents three different use case scenarios
that explain different aspects of the sensing as a service
model: (1) waste management, (2) smart agriculture, and
(3) environmental management. All three scenarios share
common a sets of characteristics as well as few unique
characteristics. Waste management has a direct impact on
cities. Environmental management has direct, indirect, and
long term impact on the entire human life-cycle both in
urban and rural living. Further, smart agriculture makes
indirect impact on sustainability towards the smart cities.

5.1. Waste Management

Waste management is one of the toughest challenge that
modern cities have to deal with. Waste management
consists of different processes such as collection, transport,
processing, disposal, managing, and monitoring of waste
materials. These processes cost signiﬁcant amount of
money, time, and labour. Optimizing waste management
processes help to save money that can be used to address
other challenges that smart cities need to deal with. In
Figure 6, we illustrate how the sensing as a service model
works in the waste management domain. In a modern
smart city, there are several parties who are interested in
waste management (e.g. city council, recycling companies,
manufacturing plants, and authorities related to health
and safety). Instead of deploying sensors and collecting
information independently, the sensing as a service model
allows all the interest groups to share the infrastructure
and bare the related costs collectively. The most important
aspect of such a collaboration is the cost reduction
that individual groups need to spend otherwise. All the
interested parties can retrieve and process sensor data in
real time in order to achieve their own objective. The cost
depends on the data requirement of the interest group.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

For example, a city council may use sensor data to
develop optimized garbage collection strategies, so they
can save fuel cost related to garbage trucks. Additionally,
recycling companies can use sensor data to predict and
track the amount of waste coming into their plants to be
processed so they can optimize their internal processes.
Further, health and safety authorities can monitor and
supervise the waste management process without spending
substantial amount of money for manual monitoring
inspections. The phenomenon of sharing sensor data using
a sensing as a service model creates a synergy effect (i.e.
interaction of multiple elements in a system to produce
an effect greater than the sum of their individual effects).
The sensing as a service model ensures the long term
sustainability of the IoT infrastructure.

the sensing as a service model

Let us discuss how this technology can be used to
support
in ﬁnancially
viable manner. In order to perform waste management,
different types of sensors need to be deployed in different
places such as garbage cans and trucks. These sensors
need to detect information such as the amount of garbage,
types of garbage, and so on. As we have depicted in
Figure 6, direct and indirect communication strategies
can be used to collect and communicate sensor data to
the cloud. Sensors with energy harvesting capabilities
are important
in this domain [30]. As represented in
step (1) in Figure 6, low powered [31] and low capable
sensors can be used to sense and data can be uploaded
to the cloud with the help of nearby infrastructure (e.g.
through communication devices attached to street lights
or similar infrastructure that have access to rich energy
sources and communication capabilities). Additionally,
when long range communication is not available, data can
be uploaded to the cloud with the help of auto-mobiles, as
depicted in step (2) in Figure 6, such as garbage trucks,
city council vehicles, buses that operate in the areas and
so on. Furthermore, both active and passive sensors can be
used to sense the environment [32]. Direct communication
can be done via technologies such as 3G which makes this
approach less dependant on third parties (as depicted in (3)
in Figure 6).

5.2. Smart Agriculture

Currently, the authors are actively involved in designing
and developing open platforms for sensor data collection,
processing and sharing in the domain of agriculture
through two projects: Phenonet [33] and OpenIoT [23].
In this scenario, the general public is not directly involved
as in the smart home domain. In Figure 7, we illustrate
how the sensing as a service model works in the smart
agriculture domain. Agriculture is an importation part of
smart cities as it contributes to the food supply-chain that
facilitates a large number of communities concentrated
into cities.

The sensing as a service model allows to conduct
scientiﬁc research and exploration more efﬁciently
and efﬁciently. Further, it opens up different research

Figure 7. Efﬁcient and effective collaborative research sup-

ported by sensing as a service model

opportunities which are unlikely to occurr in a traditional
research model. Let us explain the Phenonet project in
details and the applicability of the sensing as a service
model towards agricultural research. Phenonet describes
the network of sensors collecting information over a
ﬁeld of experimental crops. Researchers at
the High
Resolution Plant Phenomics Centre are testing a network
of smart sensor nodes able to monitor plant growth and
performance information and climate conditions. Even
though the main research goal of deploying sensors
and collecting data is to understand plant growth under
different climate conditions,
the same set of sensors
can be utilized to perform a verity of different research
activities in different domains. The data can be shared
among different research organizations and institutions
located around the world. Due to limited funding, most
of these research institutions may not be able to maintain
large scale sensor deployments (e.g. academic institutions,
specially in developing countries). However, the sensing
as a service model allows all these interest groups, who
are unable to set-up their own sensor deployments, to
perform research using actual data with signiﬁcantly less
costs. Further, the sensing as a service model creates

opportunities across different domains. For example, the
above mentioned sensor data can be used to understand
pest control and related phenomenon. Additionally they
can be used to understand soil conditions where bio-
scientist may be interested. More importantly, the sensing
as a service model allows researchers to share resources
across borders and understand phenomenon which are not
available in their own countries.

5.3. Environmental Management

This domain has the unique ability of utilizing existing
sensors that are deployed for different reasons. Most
of the sensors used in environmental monitoring are
commonly used in other domains such as climate, wild
ﬁre detection, and structural health monitoring. Using
the sensing as a service model,
interest groups can
acquire relevant sensor data without deploying sensors by
themselves. Further, environmental management is a large
domain where a single organization cannot deal with (e.g.
wild ﬁre). A model like sensing as a service stimulates
innovative solutions that use the same data but produce
different results using different processing and analysing
techniques (e.g. prediction, visualization, simulation). As
we discussed in Section 3, ESPs can help the sensor data
consumers to orchestrate existing services into different
data processing [34] and analysis work-ﬂows [35].

6. ADVANTAGES AND BENEFITS

Some of the major advantages and beneﬁts in the sensing
as a service model are discussed below:
• Built-in cloud computing: It is modelled around cloud
computing. Therefore, it inherits all the beneﬁts of
the fundamental cloud computing models such as
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Scalable and widely accessible
processing and storage resources are available to
facilitate sensing as a service software platforms (SPs
and ESPs). Sensor data consumers only need to pay for
the data they use. Therefore, the cost of data acquisition
reduces signiﬁcantly due to sharing, participatory /
crowd sourcing, and reusing nature (i.e. sense once and
use by many).

• Participatory sensing: The workload is distributed
among different players in the model. This enables
rapid deployment of sensors across wider geographical
locations that capture various phenomena.

• Sharing and reusing: In traditional methods, each party
(group or person) who wants to collect sensor data
needs to visit the ﬁeld and deploy the sensors manually
by themselves. Further, there is no easy way to share
sensor data collected by one party with others. Sensing
as a service is a model that stimulates by concept
of sharing. In simple terms, if someone has already
deployed the sensors, others can have access to them

8

by paying a fee to the sensor owner. One of the
major arguments that could arise regarding sensing as a
service model is that “How to convince a manufacturer
to embed sensors and communication capabilities into
devices we use in everyday life (e.g refrigerator in the
use-case presented in Section 4)”. This question can be
answered in two different perspectives.
First, IoT envisions to have sensor embedded into
objects around us. The goal of IoT is to allow devices
to communicate with each other. Naturally, such a goal
forces next generation devices to be embedded with rich
sensing and communication capabilities. Therefore,
the motivation is given to the manufacturers not by
the sensing as a service model but
the vision of
IoT. The sensing as a service model is designed to
provide incentives to users which motivate them to
purchase next generation devices that supports both
IoT envisioned interactions as well as the sensing as a
service model. The additional cost that contributes to
increase the prices of the devices (due to embedding
rich sensing and communication capabilities) can be
easily covered by participating in the sensing as a
service model
itself. Even today, state of the art
devices such as refrigerators and televisions comprise
communication and sensing capabilities.

• Reduction of data acquisition cost: Due to the shared
and collaborative nature, data acquisition cost will
be reduced signiﬁcantly. Such a sustainable business
model stimulates more and more sensor deployments.
Further, technological advances and higher demands
allow to produce sensors in mass volumes using cheap
materials by reducing the cost per unit. Further, this
helps to collect data from sensors which was impossible
previously.

• Collect data previously unavailable: This model allows
to collect sensor data which is impossible to collect
using traditional non-collaborative methods. This
business model promotes and stimulates the sensor
deployments by companies at commercial level. As
we explained earlier in Section 3, dedicated business
entities will deploy sensors in public places such
as parks and bridges so government authorities can
have access to those sensors by paying only for
the data they need in real-time or archived. Today
business entities spend substantial amount of money
to conduct market analyses and consumer surveys.
A sample of 1,000 respondents, which would give a
statistical accuracy of +/-3.1% costs around $8,000
[36]. Recently, different third party companies started
offering consumer surveys on behalf of businesses.
One such solution is Google Consumer Surveys
(www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys). Google
Consumer Surveys allows businesses to target user
groups with speciﬁc criteria and conduct the survey.
Currently, one user response cost around $0.10, 1/10th
of the cost of similar quality research conduct using
traditional methods.

Sensing as a Service Model for Smart Cities Supported by Internet of Things

Even though such approaches have reduced the cost
of surveys, they still have deﬁciencies such as latency,
inaccuracies, and so on. In the sensing as a service
model, all the data is directly coming from the sensor
without user intervention. This also helps to reduce the
cost of data acquisition. Due to privacy concerns it is
important to anonymise the sensor data collected. We
discuss privacy matters later. In the smart home scenario
we discussed in Section 4, we explained how a single
sensor attached to a refrigerator, and cheap passive
RFID tags attached to consumer products, produce
valuable information of consumer behaviour that can be
used by thousand of companies. This drastically reduces
the consumer survey cost as well as pay off the cost of
attaching sensors to the products.

• Innovations: Due to a reduction in sensor data acquisition
cost, larger number of interest groups will be able
to access to them. Further, the availability of sensor
data which was not available previously can also
signiﬁcantly stimulate innovation . Sensing as a service
model itself provides space for innovation in the ESP
layer. The cloud-based value added services provided
in the ESP layer allows the sensor data consumers
to achieve their objective easily and faster in many
different application domains.

• Applications: Easily accessible sensor data allows
government authorities, academia, research institutions,
and businesses to address different challenges in
Smart Cities such as trafﬁc, energy, water, education,
and unemployment, health, and crime management.
For example, accurate data on energy consumption
in a city allows managing electric grids efﬁciently
by analysing and predicting energy consumption
behaviours, patterns, future trends, and needs.

• Real-time data for decision making and policy making:
This model enables collecting sensor data in real-
time, from a variety of different domains, which
facilitates the decision making processes. Such data is
expensive to collect and usually unavailable for decision
making in traditional sensor deploying environments.
For example, data collected from sensors deployed in
vehicles and roads allow the authorities to monitor
and manage trafﬁc in real-time. Further, sensor data
collected over a period of time (archived) can be used
to make policy decisions. For example, trafﬁc data over
a period on a speciﬁc city will help a city governance
to make long term strategic decisions such as whether
to invest on a tram service across the city or not. In
addition to the points discussed above, there are many
other direct and indirect beneﬁts in the sensing as a
service model.

• Direct and indirect beneﬁts: The sensing as a service
model creates a win-win situation for all the parties
involved. Based on the scenario we presented in Section
4, Mike (sensor owners’ perspective) is getting a
return (a valuable offer). In DairyIceCream perspective,

Trans. Emerging Tel. Tech. 2014; 00:1–12 c(cid:13) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
DOI: 10.1002/ett
Prepared using ettauth.cls

now they have real-time data about product consumer
behaviour (e.g. when Mike eats ice cream, how frequent,
whether Mike use substitutions and so on). Therefore,
DairyIceCream is no longer required to conduct manual
surveys and market analyses.

• Privacy preservation: Finally and more importantly,
this model provide complete control of the privacy of
sensor owners in their own hands. The ﬁnal decision
of whether to publish their sensors or not is taken
by the sensor owners. It allows the sensor owners
to control and protect their privacy. Additionally, the
sensing as a service model needs to be supported by
anonymization techniques. For example, lets consider
security and privacy challenges [37] related to the smart
home scenario we presented in Section 4. During the
conﬁguration process, it is important to identify the
information and preferences related to Mike. In order
to protect
the privacy of the users, SPs and ESPs
should not provide personal information to the sensor
data consumers. Such approach helps to preserve user
privacy. Additionally, once the deal between the sensor
owner, sensor consumer and the sensor provider is
done, data retrieves from Mike’s sensors should be
explicitly anonymized. It is important to develop new
algorithms and security devices that can anonymize
sensitive information (such as exact location).

7. OPEN CHALLENGES

The sensing as a service model can contribute signiﬁcantly
to address the challenges in the IoT and SC. There are
many open challenges and issues that need to be tackled.
We identify some of the major challenges in the sensing
as a service model under three categories in Table I:
technological, economical, and social, where some can
be discussed under multiple categories. Each of these
challenges shows research directions for future work in the
sensing as a service domain.

8. CONCLUSIONS

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
sensing as a service model and its applicability towards
Smart Cities in the Internet of Things paradigm. Our
vision is backed up by a number of projects initiated
around the globe, including FP7 ICT project OpenIoT [23].
We discussed the model from three different perspectives
including technological, economical, and social. We
examined how the sensing as a service can be a sustainable,
scalable, and powerful model. The sensing as a service
model allows utilizing resources efﬁciently so limited
resource can be used to accommodate large numbers of
consumers. Further, it also creates a win-win situation for
all the parties involved. We identiﬁed a number of major

and issues

Description, signiﬁcance, and research directions to address the challenges

• Technology plays the most important role in enabling the sensing as a service model. This model uses the same
infrastructure that IoT envisions. Therefore, most of the technological solutions that are developed to facilitate
sensing as a service can be used to realize the vision of IoT. The sensing as a service model is expected to
facilitate billions of sensors and parallel sensor data streams. A major challenge is to develop middleware
solutions that allow to handle such demand [23]. Similarly, this model needs signiﬁcant improvements in data
communication bandwidth [38] over the existing infrastructure (e.g. ﬁber). Another major challenge is the
sensor conﬁguration. The term ‘sensor conﬁguration’ encapsulates different aspects of conﬁguration that needs
to be done: sensor embedded software, intermediate devices, and cloud (middleware) software. In reference to
the scenario we presented in Section 4, sensors in Mike’s new refrigerator need to be conﬁgured autonomously
so they can communicate with the SP. Such an approach needs to deal with challenges such as heterogeneity:
sensor types (e.g. RFID, temperature), protocols and communications technologies (e.g. Wi-Fi, Zigbee). In
addition, once a deal is done, sensor behaviour need to be conﬁgured according to the agreement between the
sensor consumer and the sensor owner (e.g. sampling rate, data communication frequency and so on). Further,
SPs and ESPs may need to conﬁgure their cloud software accordingly. The sensing as a service model is a
distributed system. It is critical to utilise computational devices with different capabilities and capacities (e.g.
sensors, mobile phones, Raspberry Pi, laptops, servers) [39]. Another challenge is to ensure the interoperability
among different sensor hardware and cloud solutions. Complying with common standards in key areas in
the architecture (such as communication interfaces and data formats) is critical. Energy conservation is also
a challenge that needs to be addressed across all the entities in the model due to the large scale and the resource
restricted nature of the sensors. Other than the sensor data, it is important to capture context information (e.g.
battery level of the sensors, redundant sensors, access to energy sources, accuracy, reliability) as well [21].
Context information allows to design optimized sensing schedules and strategies that ensure the sustainability
of the IoT infrastructure.

• Standardization is the key to interoperability. We have experienced the value of interoperability in service
computing and many other occasions throughout the history of computing. Standardization efforts need to
be carried out as early as possible to avoid signiﬁcant frustrations and costs that may occur at later stages.
Technology needs ensure the accuracy of the data up to an acceptable level as it is one of the main motivations
behind the Sensing as a service model. It is important to anonymize the sensor data collected. Sensitive
information such as location need to be implicitly altered to protect the sensor owner privacy. This should
be done in both the hardware and software levels. For the hardware level, we need to develop next generation
security appliance that can be used to anonymize data at the ground level (i.e. physically close to the sensor
owners). Techniques similar to privacy preserving data sharing ad matching [40] need to be developed in order
to combine sensor data to anonymize entities / proﬁles (excluding sensitive data) later at the server level.

• The sensing as a service model will collect enormous amount of data that need to be processed and understood.
It will open up opportunities for thousands of new businesses. The entry barriers need to be kept at a minimum
to stimulate new start-ups to be established to provide more value added services (e.g. search sensors based
on context information [26] and user requirements [28]). The opportunities are ranging from the point where
data is collected and to the point data is delivered. As we argued earlier, most of the users who may consume
sensor data will not have technical expertise. Therefore, understanding data and extract valuable information
from sensor data, by data fusing and reasoning, can also provide value added services.

• The sensing as a service model promotes a healthy competition among parties involved as it helps both the sensor
data owners and sensor data consumers. Sustainability needs to be ensured by having a fair and transparent
ﬁnancial model which motivates all the parties to be retained in the business. Sensor data and knowledge
produced using them need to be accurate and credible so consumers can make important and potentially costly
strategic decisions based on them.

• Trust and social acceptance in vital towards the adaptation of the sensing as a service model. If sensor owners
do not trust the sensing as a service, the entire model will fail. In order to win the trust, a long term change
management process is required. It needs to be supported by increasing the awareness about inner-workings
and beneﬁts of the model. New privacy protection and security protocols [41] need to be introduced in order to
make the model sustainable by winning the trust of all parties involved.

• Security and privacy is a must [42]. It needs to be implemented in number of levels. First, at the technology level,
secondly, in government and business policy level and ﬁnally, through strict legal terms and conditions. Policies
need to be set in order to keep the accessibility fairly open to the sensor data consumers while validating and
monitoring all the parties involved in the model. Maximum usability at both ends (the sensor owner and sensor
data consumer end) helps the model to be adopted by the wider community. Automated sensor conﬁguration
plays a signiﬁcant role in usability because most of the sensor owner will be non-technical.
