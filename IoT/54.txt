Abstract:  The Internet of Things (IOT) means connecting people, things, and devices in order to create an omnipresent 
computing world. One of the most important challenges in convincing users to adopt this kind of all-around network is the 
protection  of  security  and  privacy  in  different  applications.  This  paper  presents  the  results  of  interviews  conducted  in  a 
Finnish study during 8/2012-2/2013. In this research, 11 Finnish people working with different aspects of IOT development 
and 11 ordinary Finnish people were interviewed. The goal was to investigate their feelings on the IOT and its applications, 
as well as personal opinions on security and individual privacy in the IOT. Most of the answerers in this study believed that 
we are heading towards the IOT in the future and many IOT applications were seen tempting. However, security and priva-
cy issues, the lack of control, and the actual need for versatile IOT applications were questioned. The people working with 
the IOT were found to be more critical towards the IOT than the ordinary people. An introduction of the IOT, examples of 
potential applications, the conducted interviews and collected answers, as well as highlights of the collected free comments 
are presented in this paper.

1. Introduction 

The  Internet  of  Things  (IOT)  is  a  conceptual  vision  to 
connect  things  (everyday  things  from  school  buildings  to 
coffee  cups)  and  devices  (from  laptops  to  ovens),  in  order 
to  create  a  ubiquitous  computing  world.  Things  will  ex-
change data and information  about the environment,  while 
reacting  autonomously  to  different  events,  influencing  the 
environment,  and  creating  services.  This  all  can  happen 
with  or  without  human  intervention.  The  IOT  is  thus  the 
extension of the Internet to the next level, i.e., bringing the 
Internet  to  the  real  physical  world  of  things.  Potential  ex-
amples  of  the  versatile  applications  of  the  IOT  are  pre-
sented next. 

Given  that  a  growing  number  of  people  have  chronic 
diseases  and  inconveniences,  health-related  applications  of 
the  IOT  are  gathering  more  and  more  attention.  Potential 
applications include e.g. assistance and monitoring of con-
ditions  of  patients  inside  hospitals  and  at  home,  and  acci-
dent victim’s  medical journals that are automatically  made 
available to the caregivers to ensure that optimal treatment 
can  be  provided.  Electronic  tags  can  be  used  in  drugs  and 
drug  boxes  can  carry  information  on  adverse  effects  and 
optimal  dosage,  monitor  the  use,  inform  the  pharmacist 

 

when new supply is needed, know incompatible drugs, and 
prevent  overdoses.  The  IOT  also  offers  many  applications 
to  home-environment,  for  example  automatic  energy  and 
water  supply  consumption,  control  of  temperature  gauges, 
remotely  armed  home  security  system,  switching  ap-
pliances on and off, etc. Possible retail applications include 
e.g.  payment  processing  based  on  location  or  duration  and 
allowing  customers  to  pay  in  department  stores  only  by 
walking out  with the products. Customers can also receive 
advices  in  the  point  of  sale  according  to  customer  habits, 
preferences,  presence  of  allergic  components,  or  expiring 
dates. Also smart cities are examples of the potential future 
IOT applications; for example, the citizens can monitor the 
pollution  concentration  and  can  receive  automatic  alarms 
when  the  radiation  level  reaches  too  high  level,  rubbish 
bins can send an alarm  to garbage collector  when they are 
close  to  being  full,  etc.  The  IOT  also  has  many  potential 
applications  in  catastrophic  prevention,  for  example  detec-
tion and  warning of forest fires and earthquake, and moni-
toring  of  vibrations  and  material  conditions  in  buildings 
and bridges [1-6]. 

A  number  of  countries  or  districts  have  realized  the  im-
portance  of  the  IOT  in  the  recovery  of  economic  growth 
and sustainability. Amongst them the European Union (EU), 
the United States, and China are prominent examples. Thus,

Johanna Virkki: Finnish perspectives for the IOT 

companies,  universities,  and  research  institutions  currently 
take an active part in IOT development worldwide [7]. 

  One of the most important challenges in convincing us-
ers  to  adopt  this  kind  of  all-around  network  is  the  protec-
tion of security. And it is not only security, but privacy too. 
Concerns  over  security  and  privacy  can  spread  wide,  par-
ticularly  as  wireless  systems  can  track  users’  personal  in-
formation,  actions,  behaviour  and  ongoing  preferences. 
Invisible  and  constant  data  exchange  between  things  and 
people,  and  between  things  and  other  things,  will  occur 
unknown  to  the  owners  and  originators  of  such  data.  The 
huge volumes of data that the IOT generates will have to be 
routed,  captured,  analysed,  and  acted  upon  in  timely  rele-
vant ways. Working out how to do this will be no easy task. 
One  important  issue  related  to  these  different  applications 
is the data aggregation (combining seemingly non-sensitive 
separate  small  bits  of  information  may  reveal  additional, 
possibly sensitive information) [8]. Similar effect can occur 
when the data collected for one purpose is used for a differ-
ent purpose, and this is done without the person's approval. 
As the devices and things within the IOT collect seemingly 
inconsequential  fragments  of  data  for  their  service,  it 
should  also  be  considered  what  happens  when  all  that  in-
formation  is  brought  together,  correlated,  and  reviewed. 
The  sheer  scale  and  capacity  of  the  new  technologies  will 
magnify  this  problem  and  source  suspect.  Thus,  security 
and  privacy  of  the  IOT  are  currently  active  and  important 
research topics [2-7, 9-14]. 

Interesting point of view are the differences and similari-
ties  in  personal  thoughts  of  people  who  work  with  the  de-
velopment of the IOT and of those people, who are not yet 
so familiar  with the concept, but are potential end users of 
the  IOT  (henceforth  referred  to  as  “ordinary  people”).  In 
this research, 22 people were interviewed in Finland during 
a period of 7 months, 8/2012-2/2013, in order to investigate 
their  thoughts  and  feelings  on  the  Internet  and  individual 
privacy, as well as their opinions on the IOT and its appli-
cations. 

This paper is organized as follows: The introduction sec-
tion introduces the concept of the IOT and gives examples 
of  potential  applications.  Section  2  presents  the  performed 
interviews, including the information on the answerers and 
presented  questions.  The  collected  answers  and  examples 
from free comments are presented and discussed in section 
3. The last section summarizes the results and presents the 
conclusions of this paper. 

2. Interviews 

For  this  research,  11  people  working  with  different  as-
pects  of  the  IOT,  e.g.  radiofrequency  identification,  wire-
less  networks,  and  wireless  communication  were  inter-
viewed. These answerers were chosen from different organ-
izations  (from  researchers  of  different  universities  in  Fin-
land and from workers of companies on the field). Also, 11 
ordinary  people,  working  in  very  different  areas,  were  in-
terviewed.  The  idea  of  this  research  study  is  not  only  to 

compare the answers from these two different groups but to 
gather  more versatile answers by interviewing people  with 
different  backgrounds.  Thus,  people  of  different  age  and 
people of both gender were chosen (the genders and ages of 
the  answerers  can  be  seen  in  Table  1).  The  personal  inter-
views were conducted by an associate of the researcher, and 
they  took  place  either  at  the  answerers  working  facility, 
home, or at a neutral, public place. Some of the interviews 
were  done  by  private  e-mails  between  the  researcher  and 
the answerer. All these interviews thus had more flexibility 
than  only  a  paper  survey,  as  both  the  researcher  and  the 
answerer were able to ask for clarification. This survey had 
5 questions and a possibility for free comments. Questions 
are listed next.

3. Results and Discussion 

This  section  introduces  and  discusses  the  collected  an-
swers. All the examples of the achieved free comments are 
presented as direct quotes and their text is italicized. 

3.1. Question 1 

Social  media  refers  to  the  means  of  interactions  among 
people in  which they create,  share, and exchange informa-
tion in virtual communities and networks. It allows users to 
share  their  lives  in  many  different  ways,  via  updates,  im-
ages, voice, etc. Social media is more and more becoming a 
platform  for  the  public  to  voice  their  opinion  and  present 
them to a huge audience in the Internet. Many people have 
chosen to make their life, at least partly, public. In Question 
1,  it  was  asked  if  the  answerers  are  currently  using  social 
media  and/or  share  pictures  or  personal  information  of 
themselves  in  the  Internet.  The  answers  to  this  question 
(shown  in  Fig.  1)  show  that  73  %  of  all  the  answers  were 
“many times a week” or “sometimes”, and 27 % of all the 
answers  were  “no”.  There  were  significantly  more  “no” 
answers among the people that work with the IOT: 91 % of 
the  ordinary  people  answered  “many  times  a  week”  or 
“sometimes”,  whereas among the people  working  with  the 
IOT, 55 % answered “many times a week” or “sometimes”. 
Also, in their free comments, people working with the IOT 
were more critical towards the use of social media. 

vidual privacy in the Internet (results can be seen in Fig. 2 
and  Fig.  3,  respectively).  According  to  these  answers, 
people believe that the possibility of moving from the tradi-
tional  Internet  towards  the  IOT  during  the  following  10 
years  will not significantly affect how  much they can con-
trol their individual privacy in the Internet. However, some 
answerers  from  both  groups  do  believe  for  a  negative 
change,  which  can  be  seen  from  the  differences  between 
Fig  2  and  Fig  3.  The  average  value  of  all  the  answers  to 
Question  2  was  2,64  and  the  average  value  of  all  the  an-
swers  to  Question  5  was  3,18.  Thus,  according  to  these 
results,  people  already  feel  that  there  is  a  lack  of  control 
related  to  the  individual  privacy  in  the  Internet.  This  was 
also  pointed  out  in  the  free  comments.  A  lot  of  work  is 
currently  done  to  maintain  and  improve  the  security  and 
privacy in the Internet, which was also mentioned.

they succeed..”

or applications that mean I may lose my privacy. I will not

things anyone promises.”

Abstract:  The Internet of Things (IOT) means connecting people, things, and devices in order to create an omnipresent 
computing world. One of the most important challenges in convincing users to adopt this kind of all-around network is the 
protection  of  security  and  privacy  in  different  applications.  This  paper  presents  the  results  of  interviews  conducted  in  a 
Finnish study during 8/2012-2/2013. In this research, 11 Finnish people working with different aspects of IOT development 
and 11 ordinary Finnish people were interviewed. The goal was to investigate their feelings on the IOT and its applications, 
as well as personal opinions on security and individual privacy in the IOT. Most of the answerers in this study believed that 
we are heading towards the IOT in the future and many IOT applications were seen tempting. However, security and priva-
cy issues, the lack of control, and the actual need for versatile IOT applications were questioned. The people working with 
the IOT were found to be more critical towards the IOT than the ordinary people. An introduction of the IOT, examples of 
potential applications, the conducted interviews and collected answers, as well as highlights of the collected free comments 
are presented in this paper.

1. Introduction 

The  Internet  of  Things  (IOT)  is  a  conceptual  vision  to 
connect  things  (everyday  things  from  school  buildings  to 
coffee  cups)  and  devices  (from  laptops  to  ovens),  in  order 
to  create  a  ubiquitous  computing  world.  Things  will  ex-
change data and information  about the environment,  while 
reacting  autonomously  to  different  events,  influencing  the 
environment,  and  creating  services.  This  all  can  happen 
with  or  without  human  intervention.  The  IOT  is  thus  the 
extension of the Internet to the next level, i.e., bringing the 
Internet  to  the  real  physical  world  of  things.  Potential  ex-
amples  of  the  versatile  applications  of  the  IOT  are  pre-
sented next. 

Given  that  a  growing  number  of  people  have  chronic 
diseases  and  inconveniences,  health-related  applications  of 
the  IOT  are  gathering  more  and  more  attention.  Potential 
applications include e.g. assistance and monitoring of con-
ditions  of  patients  inside  hospitals  and  at  home,  and  acci-
dent victim’s  medical journals that are automatically  made 
available to the caregivers to ensure that optimal treatment 
can  be  provided.  Electronic  tags  can  be  used  in  drugs  and 
drug  boxes  can  carry  information  on  adverse  effects  and 
optimal  dosage,  monitor  the  use,  inform  the  pharmacist 

 

when new supply is needed, know incompatible drugs, and 
prevent  overdoses.  The  IOT  also  offers  many  applications 
to  home-environment,  for  example  automatic  energy  and 
water  supply  consumption,  control  of  temperature  gauges, 
remotely  armed  home  security  system,  switching  ap-
pliances on and off, etc. Possible retail applications include 
e.g.  payment  processing  based  on  location  or  duration  and 
allowing  customers  to  pay  in  department  stores  only  by 
walking out  with the products. Customers can also receive 
advices  in  the  point  of  sale  according  to  customer  habits, 
preferences,  presence  of  allergic  components,  or  expiring 
dates. Also smart cities are examples of the potential future 
IOT applications; for example, the citizens can monitor the 
pollution  concentration  and  can  receive  automatic  alarms 
when  the  radiation  level  reaches  too  high  level,  rubbish 
bins can send an alarm  to garbage collector  when they are 
close  to  being  full,  etc.  The  IOT  also  has  many  potential 
applications  in  catastrophic  prevention,  for  example  detec-
tion and  warning of forest fires and earthquake, and moni-
toring  of  vibrations  and  material  conditions  in  buildings 
and bridges [1-6]. 

A  number  of  countries  or  districts  have  realized  the  im-
portance  of  the  IOT  in  the  recovery  of  economic  growth 
and sustainability. Amongst them the European Union (EU), 
the United States, and China are prominent examples. Thus, 

24 
 

Johanna Virkki: Finnish perspectives for the IOT 

companies,  universities,  and  research  institutions  currently 
take an active part in IOT development worldwide [7]. 

  One of the most important challenges in convincing us-
ers  to  adopt  this  kind  of  all-around  network  is  the  protec-
tion of security. And it is not only security, but privacy too. 
Concerns  over  security  and  privacy  can  spread  wide,  par-
ticularly  as  wireless  systems  can  track  users’  personal  in-
formation,  actions,  behaviour  and  ongoing  preferences. 
Invisible  and  constant  data  exchange  between  things  and 
people,  and  between  things  and  other  things,  will  occur 
unknown  to  the  owners  and  originators  of  such  data.  The 
huge volumes of data that the IOT generates will have to be 
routed,  captured,  analysed,  and  acted  upon  in  timely  rele-
vant ways. Working out how to do this will be no easy task. 
One  important  issue  related  to  these  different  applications 
is the data aggregation (combining seemingly non-sensitive 
separate  small  bits  of  information  may  reveal  additional, 
possibly sensitive information) [8]. Similar effect can occur 
when the data collected for one purpose is used for a differ-
ent purpose, and this is done without the person's approval. 
As the devices and things within the IOT collect seemingly 
inconsequential  fragments  of  data  for  their  service,  it 
should  also  be  considered  what  happens  when  all  that  in-
formation  is  brought  together,  correlated,  and  reviewed. 
The  sheer  scale  and  capacity  of  the  new  technologies  will 
magnify  this  problem  and  source  suspect.  Thus,  security 
and  privacy  of  the  IOT  are  currently  active  and  important 
research topics [2-7, 9-14]. 

Interesting point of view are the differences and similari-
ties  in  personal  thoughts  of  people  who  work  with  the  de-
velopment of the IOT and of those people, who are not yet 
so familiar  with the concept, but are potential end users of 
the  IOT  (henceforth  referred  to  as  “ordinary  people”).  In 
this research, 22 people were interviewed in Finland during 
a period of 7 months, 8/2012-2/2013, in order to investigate 
their  thoughts  and  feelings  on  the  Internet  and  individual 
privacy, as well as their opinions on the IOT and its appli-
cations. 

This paper is organized as follows: The introduction sec-
tion introduces the concept of the IOT and gives examples 
of  potential  applications.  Section  2  presents  the  performed 
interviews, including the information on the answerers and 
presented  questions.  The  collected  answers  and  examples 
from free comments are presented and discussed in section 
3. The last section summarizes the results and presents the 
conclusions of this paper. 

2. Interviews 

For  this  research,  11  people  working  with  different  as-
pects  of  the  IOT,  e.g.  radiofrequency  identification,  wire-
less  networks,  and  wireless  communication  were  inter-
viewed. These answerers were chosen from different organ-
izations  (from  researchers  of  different  universities  in  Fin-
land and from workers of companies on the field). Also, 11 
ordinary  people,  working  in  very  different  areas,  were  in-
terviewed.  The  idea  of  this  research  study  is  not  only  to 

compare the answers from these two different groups but to 
gather  more versatile answers by interviewing people  with 
different  backgrounds.  Thus,  people  of  different  age  and 
people of both gender were chosen (the genders and ages of 
the  answerers  can  be  seen  in  Table  1).  The  personal  inter-
views were conducted by an associate of the researcher, and 
they  took  place  either  at  the  answerers  working  facility, 
home, or at a neutral, public place. Some of the interviews 
were  done  by  private  e-mails  between  the  researcher  and 
the answerer. All these interviews thus had more flexibility 
than  only  a  paper  survey,  as  both  the  researcher  and  the 
answerer were able to ask for clarification. This survey had 
5 questions and a possibility for free comments. Questions 
are listed next.

3. Results and Discussion 

This  section  introduces  and  discusses  the  collected  an-
swers. All the examples of the achieved free comments are 
presented as direct quotes and their text is italicized. 

3.1. Question 1 

Social  media  refers  to  the  means  of  interactions  among 
people in  which they create,  share, and exchange informa-
tion in virtual communities and networks. It allows users to 
share  their  lives  in  many  different  ways,  via  updates,  im-
ages, voice, etc. Social media is more and more becoming a 
platform  for  the  public  to  voice  their  opinion  and  present 
them to a huge audience in the Internet. Many people have 
chosen to make their life, at least partly, public. In Question 
1,  it  was  asked  if  the  answerers  are  currently  using  social 
media  and/or  share  pictures  or  personal  information  of 
themselves  in  the  Internet.  The  answers  to  this  question 
(shown  in  Fig.  1)  show  that  73  %  of  all  the  answers  were 
“many times a week” or “sometimes”, and 27 % of all the 
answers  were  “no”.  There  were  significantly  more  “no” 
answers among the people that work with the IOT: 91 % of 
the  ordinary  people  answered  “many  times  a  week”  or 
“sometimes”,  whereas among the people  working  with  the 
IOT, 55 % answered “many times a week” or “sometimes”. 
Also, in their free comments, people working with the IOT 
were more critical towards the use of social media. 

vidual privacy in the Internet (results can be seen in Fig. 2 
and  Fig.  3,  respectively).  According  to  these  answers, 
people believe that the possibility of moving from the tradi-
tional  Internet  towards  the  IOT  during  the  following  10 
years  will not significantly affect how  much they can con-
trol their individual privacy in the Internet. However, some 
answerers  from  both  groups  do  believe  for  a  negative 
change,  which  can  be  seen  from  the  differences  between 
Fig  2  and  Fig  3.  The  average  value  of  all  the  answers  to 
Question  2  was  2,64  and  the  average  value  of  all  the  an-
swers  to  Question  5  was  3,18.  Thus,  according  to  these 
results,  people  already  feel  that  there  is  a  lack  of  control 
related  to  the  individual  privacy  in  the  Internet.  This  was 
also  pointed  out  in  the  free  comments.  A  lot  of  work  is 
currently  done  to  maintain  and  improve  the  security  and 
privacy in the Internet, which was also mentioned.

es, while there are benefits also. In these cases I see privacy

benefits.” 

“There  really  is  no  information  available  about  what 
kinds  of  security  methods  they’re  using  in  many  of  the 
social  media  applications.  Why  would  I  want  to  use  (with 
my  own  personal  information!)  something  that  I  have  no 
idea of?”

people  can  currently/after  10  years  affect  their  own  indi-

“Nowadays there are a lot of problems with the security. 
I know that they are working to improve it. I just hope that 
they succeed..” 

“I do not want to use applications that have security risks 
or applications that mean I may lose my privacy. I will not 
want  to  use  them  in  the  future  either,  no  matter  how  great 
things anyone promises.” 

 

26 
 

3.3. Question 3 

As  was  described  in  the  first  section  of  this  paper,  the 
range  and  diversity  of  IOT  applications  permeates  practi-
cally  through  all  aspects  of  the  everyday  life.  Question  3 
was  about  the  IOT  applications  that  the  answerers  see  po-
tential in their own life in the future, and those they would 
not  want  into  their  life.  The  most  wanted  applications 
among  these  answerers  seem  to  be  those  related  to  health-
care,  e.g.  automatic  health-monitoring.  This  seems  reason-
able,  since  the  adjustment  of  the  healthcare  systems  to  the 
increasing  number  of  elderly  and  patients  with  chronic 
diseases is one of the biggest challenges to the EU, includ-
ing  Finland,  and  the  future  of  the  public  healthcare  is  cur-
rently a hot topic in the Finnish media. 

“Monitoring  of  my  own  health  and  the  health  of  those 

close to me”  

“From  personal  and  professional  point  of  view,  elderly 
people  more  often  benefit  of  staying  at  their  own  home  as 
long  as  possible,  where  this  kind  of  monitoring  can  be 
useful.” 

Also, versatile applications to be used at home were seen 
tempting.  These  applications  also  probably  are  the  ones 
most  commonly  mentioned  with  the  IOT.  Thus,  they  may 
be  the  applications  that  the  people  are  the  most  familiar 
with.  In  general,  very  different  kinds  of  applications  were 
mentioned to be considered helpful in everyday life.  

“Energy  and  water  supplies  consumption  monitoring.  It 

helps to save money.” 

“Cloud  storage  of  media  so  that  it  can  be  accessed  and 

used anytime and anywhere” 

“Remote control of home applications” 
“IOT  brings  lot  of  new  possibilities  for  social  life  and 

business.” 

The  lack  of  control  was  seen  as  the  main  reason  why 
some  applications  were  not  considered  desirable.  It  was 
also  questioned  if  the  cost  of  using  different  applications 
will  be  suitable.  Again,  negative  perspectives  and  feelings 
were  mentioned  more  often  in  the  answers  collected  from 
the people that work with the IOT. 

“Those  that  will  help,  but  not  cause  substantial  privacy 
concerns or other risks. This  is a  matter of balance,  mean-
ing  that  if  benefits  are  substantial  then  more  risks  can  be 
accepted.  E.g.  I  am  using  sometimes  navigation  applica-
tions  on  the  phone  while  knowing  that  the  data  can  be 
tracked.” 

“Controlling  things,  like  photo  based  recognition,  or 

something what will happen without my knowledge.” 

”Systems that I cannot control or modify myself” 
“I also do not want that the systems carry permanent in-

dividual information without a possibility to erase.” 

“I  would  not  feel  comfortable  with  a  home  alarm  or 
smart  home  system  connected  or  controllable  through  the 
Internet. Such case is especially if the authentication is not 
strong, e.g. based just on password and user name. Also the 
potential damage is essential. For example, if you can turn 
the heating completely off during the  winter time, I  would 

Johanna Virkki: Finnish perspectives for the IOT 

not use such application. Also you should be able to bypass 
locally  the  Internet  application  in  case  of  misuse  or  other 
problems.” 

3.4. Question 4 

In Question 4, it was inquired what people think will be 
the  possible  schedule  for  the  current  Internet  to  grow  into 
the IOT and this kind of all-around network to come to use, 
if it  will come to use. The answers to this question can be 
seen in Fig. 4. According to these results, 18 % of the ans-
werers  felt  that  this  will  happen  during  the  following  10 
years, 18 % during the following 20 years, and 14 % of the 
answerers felt that it will take longer than 20 years. In addi-
tion, two of the answerers (both working with the IOT) felt 
that this growing into the IOT will never happen. There was 
also  one  answerer  from  the  group  of  ordinary  people  who 
felt that this will happen in the near future. 

 

Figure 4. Results from Question 3; Opinions on the possible schedule for 
current Internet to grow into IOT and this kind of all-around network to 
come to use. 

“It is quite hard to know the schedule. There already are 
applications  that  I  think  are  part  of  the  IOT.  On  the  other 
hand,  it  seems  something  that  will  happen  in  the  far  away 
future. For example, now everybody has a computer and a 
cellular  phone  in  Finland.  This  was  not  the  case  25  years 
ago. I do not think they would have predicted this” 

In  the  free  comments,  the  IOT  was  seen  tempting,  in 
principle, but the necessity of the versatile applications was 
also questioned: 

“All  in  all,  I  expect  much  more  positive  consequences 
than  negative  ones.  Life  becomes  easier  and  IOT  is  conti-
nuously  learning  more  and  more  on  us,  our  habits,  prefe-
rences  and  the  environment  we  live  in.  However,  it  may 
also be bad for individual decision making, since IOT may 
decide options or make the final decision. We may trust too 
much  on  the  guidance  of  IOT.  Therefore  strict  personal 
profiles  for  the  applications  of  IOT  are  needed. Therefore, 
we must be active users not lazy followers.” 

“Nowadays people believe that they  need loads of stuff. 

In reality we could survive with a lot less.” 

In  addition,  it  was  questioned  (both  by  the  ordinary 
people and the people working with the IOT) if people are 
aware of the potential problems that may occur. 

“It’s scary how few people are preparing for the IOT.”

reacting  autonomously  to  different  events,  influencing  the 
environment,  and  creating  services.  This  all  can  happen 
with  or  without  human  intervention.  The  IOT  is  thus  the 
extension of the Internet to the next level, i.e., bringing the 
Internet  to  the  real  physical  world  of  things.  Potential  ex-
amples  of  the  versatile  applications  of  the  IOT  are  pre-
sented next. 

Given  that  a  growing  number  of  people  have  chronic 
diseases  and  inconveniences,  health-related  applications  of 
the  IOT  are  gathering  more  and  more  attention.  Potential 
applications include e.g. assistance and monitoring of con-
ditions  of  patients  inside  hospitals  and  at  home,  and  acci-
dent victim’s  medical journals that are automatically  made 
available to the caregivers to ensure that optimal treatment 
can  be  provided.  Electronic  tags  can  be  used  in  drugs  and 
drug  boxes  can  carry  information  on  adverse  effects  and 
optimal  dosage,  monitor  the  use,  inform  the  pharmacist 

 

when new supply is needed, know incompatible drugs, and 
prevent  overdoses.  The  IOT  also  offers  many  applications 
to  home-environment,  for  example  automatic  energy  and 
water  supply  consumption,  control  of  temperature  gauges, 
remotely  armed  home  security  system,  switching  ap-
pliances on and off, etc. Possible retail applications include 
e.g.  payment  processing  based  on  location  or  duration  and 
allowing  customers  to  pay  in  department  stores  only  by 
walking out  with the products. Customers can also receive 
advices  in  the  point  of  sale  according  to  customer  habits, 
preferences,  presence  of  allergic  components,  or  expiring 
dates. Also smart cities are examples of the potential future 
IOT applications; for example, the citizens can monitor the 
pollution  concentration  and  can  receive  automatic  alarms 
when  the  radiation  level  reaches  too  high  level,  rubbish 
bins can send an alarm  to garbage collector  when they are 
close  to  being  full,  etc.  The  IOT  also  has  many  potential 
applications  in  catastrophic  prevention,  for  example  detec-
tion and  warning of forest fires and earthquake, and moni-
toring  of  vibrations  and  material  conditions  in  buildings 
and bridges [1-6]. 

A  number  of  countries  or  districts  have  realized  the  im-
portance  of  the  IOT  in  the  recovery  of  economic  growth 
and sustainability. Amongst them the European Union (EU), 
the United States, and China are prominent examples. Thus,

Johanna Virkki: Finnish perspectives for the IOT 

companies,  universities,  and  research  institutions  currently 
take an active part in IOT development worldwide [7]. 

  One of the most important challenges in convincing us-
ers  to  adopt  this  kind  of  all-around  network  is  the  protec-
tion of security. And it is not only security, but privacy too. 
Concerns  over  security  and  privacy  can  spread  wide,  par-
ticularly  as  wireless  systems  can  track  users’  personal  in-
formation,  actions,  behaviour  and  ongoing  preferences. 
Invisible  and  constant  data  exchange  between  things  and 
people,  and  between  things  and  other  things,  will  occur 
unknown  to  the  owners  and  originators  of  such  data.  The 
huge volumes of data that the IOT generates will have to be 
routed,  captured,  analysed,  and  acted  upon  in  timely  rele-
vant ways. Working out how to do this will be no easy task. 
One  important  issue  related  to  these  different  applications 
is the data aggregation (combining seemingly non-sensitive 
separate  small  bits  of  information  may  reveal  additional, 
possibly sensitive information) [8]. Similar effect can occur 
when the data collected for one purpose is used for a differ-
ent purpose, and this is done without the person's approval. 
As the devices and things within the IOT collect seemingly 
inconsequential  fragments  of  data  for  their  service,  it 
should  also  be  considered  what  happens  when  all  that  in-
formation  is  brought  together,  correlated,  and  reviewed. 
The  sheer  scale  and  capacity  of  the  new  technologies  will 
magnify  this  problem  and  source  suspect.  Thus,  security 
and  privacy  of  the  IOT  are  currently  active  and  important 
research topics [2-7, 9-14]. 

Interesting point of view are the differences and similari-
ties  in  personal  thoughts  of  people  who  work  with  the  de-
velopment of the IOT and of those people, who are not yet 
so familiar  with the concept, but are potential end users of 
the  IOT  (henceforth  referred  to  as  “ordinary  people”).  In 
this research, 22 people were interviewed in Finland during 
a period of 7 months, 8/2012-2/2013, in order to investigate 
their  thoughts  and  feelings  on  the  Internet  and  individual 
privacy, as well as their opinions on the IOT and its appli-
cations. 

This paper is organized as follows: The introduction sec-
tion introduces the concept of the IOT and gives examples 
of  potential  applications.  Section  2  presents  the  performed 
interviews, including the information on the answerers and 
presented  questions.  The  collected  answers  and  examples 
from free comments are presented and discussed in section 
3. The last section summarizes the results and presents the 
conclusions of this paper. 

2. Interviews 

For  this  research,  11  people  working  with  different  as-
pects  of  the  IOT,  e.g.  radiofrequency  identification,  wire-
less  networks,  and  wireless  communication  were  inter-
viewed. These answerers were chosen from different organ-
izations  (from  researchers  of  different  universities  in  Fin-
land and from workers of companies on the field). Also, 11 
ordinary  people,  working  in  very  different  areas,  were  in-
terviewed.  The  idea  of  this  research  study  is  not  only  to 

compare the answers from these two different groups but to 
gather  more versatile answers by interviewing people  with 
different  backgrounds.  Thus,  people  of  different  age  and 
people of both gender were chosen (the genders and ages of 
the  answerers  can  be  seen  in  Table  1).  The  personal  inter-
views were conducted by an associate of the researcher, and 
they  took  place  either  at  the  answerers  working  facility, 
home, or at a neutral, public place. Some of the interviews 
were  done  by  private  e-mails  between  the  researcher  and 
the answerer. All these interviews thus had more flexibility 
than  only  a  paper  survey,  as  both  the  researcher  and  the 
answerer were able to ask for clarification. This survey had 
5 questions and a possibility for free comments. Questions 
are listed next.

3. Results and Discussion 

This  section  introduces  and  discusses  the  collected  an-
swers. All the examples of the achieved free comments are 
presented as direct quotes and their text is italicized. 

3.1. Question 1 

Social  media  refers  to  the  means  of  interactions  among 
people in  which they create,  share, and exchange informa-
tion in virtual communities and networks. It allows users to 
share  their  lives  in  many  different  ways,  via  updates,  im-
ages, voice, etc. Social media is more and more becoming a 
platform  for  the  public  to  voice  their  opinion  and  present 
them to a huge audience in the Internet. Many people have 
chosen to make their life, at least partly, public. In Question 
1,  it  was  asked  if  the  answerers  are  currently  using  social 
media  and/or  share  pictures  or  personal  information  of 
themselves  in  the  Internet.  The  answers  to  this  question 
(shown  in  Fig.  1)  show  that  73  %  of  all  the  answers  were 
“many times a week” or “sometimes”, and 27 % of all the 
answers  were  “no”.  There  were  significantly  more  “no” 
answers among the people that work with the IOT: 91 % of 
the  ordinary  people  answered  “many  times  a  week”  or 
“sometimes”,  whereas among the people  working  with  the 
IOT, 55 % answered “many times a week” or “sometimes”. 
Also, in their free comments, people working with the IOT 
were more critical towards the use of social media. 

vidual privacy in the Internet (results can be seen in Fig. 2 
and  Fig.  3,  respectively).  According  to  these  answers, 
people believe that the possibility of moving from the tradi-
tional  Internet  towards  the  IOT  during  the  following  10 
years  will not significantly affect how  much they can con-
trol their individual privacy in the Internet. However, some 
answerers  from  both  groups  do  believe  for  a  negative 
change,  which  can  be  seen  from  the  differences  between 
Fig  2  and  Fig  3.  The  average  value  of  all  the  answers  to 
Question  2  was  2,64  and  the  average  value  of  all  the  an-
swers  to  Question  5  was  3,18.  Thus,  according  to  these 
results,  people  already  feel  that  there  is  a  lack  of  control 
related  to  the  individual  privacy  in  the  Internet.  This  was 
also  pointed  out  in  the  free  comments.  A  lot  of  work  is 
currently  done  to  maintain  and  improve  the  security  and 
privacy in the Internet, which was also mentioned.

Figure 1. Results from Question 1; Are you currently using social media 
and/or do you share pictures or personal information on yourself in the 
Internet? 

“I  have  not  opened  a  Facebook  or  Google  account,  nei-
ther I am using any online photo storages or backup servic-
es, while there are benefits also. In these cases I see privacy 
concerns  and  legal  complications  more  substantial  than 
benefits.” 

“There  really  is  no  information  available  about  what 
kinds  of  security  methods  they’re  using  in  many  of  the 
social  media  applications.  Why  would  I  want  to  use  (with 
my  own  personal  information!)  something  that  I  have  no 
idea of?” 

3.2. Questions 2 and 5 

Questions  2  and  5  dealt  with  the  feelings  on  how  much 
people  can  currently/after  10  years  affect  their  own  indi-

 

Figure 3. Results from Question 5; How much do you think a person can 
affect his/her own individual privacy in the Internet after 10 years? 

“Everything  you  share  can  come  public  information  but 

that is the case with old fashion communication also.“ 

“I  find  the  individuals  privacy  quite  poor  and  therefore 
wish  a  lot  higher  security  before  IOT  is  everywhere  more 
than it already is.” 

“Nowadays there are a lot of problems with the security. 
I know that they are working to improve it. I just hope that 
they succeed..” 

“I do not want to use applications that have security risks 
or applications that mean I may lose my privacy. I will not 
want  to  use  them  in  the  future  either,  no  matter  how  great 
things anyone promises.” 

 

26 
 

3.3. Question 3 

As  was  described  in  the  first  section  of  this  paper,  the 
range  and  diversity  of  IOT  applications  permeates  practi-
cally  through  all  aspects  of  the  everyday  life.  Question  3 
was  about  the  IOT  applications  that  the  answerers  see  po-
tential in their own life in the future, and those they would 
not  want  into  their  life.  The  most  wanted  applications 
among  these  answerers  seem  to  be  those  related  to  health-
care,  e.g.  automatic  health-monitoring.  This  seems  reason-
able,  since  the  adjustment  of  the  healthcare  systems  to  the 
increasing  number  of  elderly  and  patients  with  chronic 
diseases is one of the biggest challenges to the EU, includ-
ing  Finland,  and  the  future  of  the  public  healthcare  is  cur-
rently a hot topic in the Finnish media. 

“Monitoring  of  my  own  health  and  the  health  of  those 

close to me”  

“From  personal  and  professional  point  of  view,  elderly 
people  more  often  benefit  of  staying  at  their  own  home  as 
long  as  possible,  where  this  kind  of  monitoring  can  be 
useful.” 

Also, versatile applications to be used at home were seen 
tempting.  These  applications  also  probably  are  the  ones 
most  commonly  mentioned  with  the  IOT.  Thus,  they  may 
be  the  applications  that  the  people  are  the  most  familiar 
with.  In  general,  very  different  kinds  of  applications  were 
mentioned to be considered helpful in everyday life.  

“Energy  and  water  supplies  consumption  monitoring.  It 

helps to save money.” 

“Cloud  storage  of  media  so  that  it  can  be  accessed  and 

used anytime and anywhere” 

“Remote control of home applications” 
“IOT  brings  lot  of  new  possibilities  for  social  life  and 

business.” 

The  lack  of  control  was  seen  as  the  main  reason  why 
some  applications  were  not  considered  desirable.  It  was 
also  questioned  if  the  cost  of  using  different  applications 
will  be  suitable.  Again,  negative  perspectives  and  feelings 
were  mentioned  more  often  in  the  answers  collected  from 
the people that work with the IOT. 

“Those  that  will  help,  but  not  cause  substantial  privacy 
concerns or other risks. This  is a  matter of balance,  mean-
ing  that  if  benefits  are  substantial  then  more  risks  can  be 
accepted.  E.g.  I  am  using  sometimes  navigation  applica-
tions  on  the  phone  while  knowing  that  the  data  can  be 
tracked.” 

“Controlling  things,  like  photo  based  recognition,  or 

something what will happen without my knowledge.” 

”Systems that I cannot control or modify myself” 
“I also do not want that the systems carry permanent in-

dividual information without a possibility to erase.” 

“I  would  not  feel  comfortable  with  a  home  alarm  or 
smart  home  system  connected  or  controllable  through  the 
Internet. Such case is especially if the authentication is not 
strong, e.g. based just on password and user name. Also the 
potential damage is essential. For example, if you can turn 
the heating completely off during the  winter time, I  would 

Johanna Virkki: Finnish perspectives for the IOT 

not use such application. Also you should be able to bypass 
locally  the  Internet  application  in  case  of  misuse  or  other 
problems.” 

3.4. Question 4 

In Question 4, it was inquired what people think will be 
the  possible  schedule  for  the  current  Internet  to  grow  into 
the IOT and this kind of all-around network to come to use, 
if it  will come to use. The answers to this question can be 
seen in Fig. 4. According to these results, 18 % of the ans-
werers  felt  that  this  will  happen  during  the  following  10 
years, 18 % during the following 20 years, and 14 % of the 
answerers felt that it will take longer than 20 years. In addi-
tion, two of the answerers (both working with the IOT) felt 
that this growing into the IOT will never happen. There was 
also  one  answerer  from  the  group  of  ordinary  people  who 
felt that this will happen in the near future. 

 

Figure 4. Results from Question 3; Opinions on the possible schedule for 
current Internet to grow into IOT and this kind of all-around network to 
come to use. 

“It is quite hard to know the schedule. There already are 
applications  that  I  think  are  part  of  the  IOT.  On  the  other 
hand,  it  seems  something  that  will  happen  in  the  far  away 
future. For example, now everybody has a computer and a 
cellular  phone  in  Finland.  This  was  not  the  case  25  years 
ago. I do not think they would have predicted this” 

In  the  free  comments,  the  IOT  was  seen  tempting,  in 
principle, but the necessity of the versatile applications was 
also questioned: 

“All  in  all,  I  expect  much  more  positive  consequences 
than  negative  ones.  Life  becomes  easier  and  IOT  is  conti-
nuously  learning  more  and  more  on  us,  our  habits,  prefe-
rences  and  the  environment  we  live  in.  However,  it  may 
also be bad for individual decision making, since IOT may 
decide options or make the final decision. We may trust too 
much  on  the  guidance  of  IOT.  Therefore  strict  personal 
profiles  for  the  applications  of  IOT  are  needed. Therefore, 
we must be active users not lazy followers.” 

“Nowadays people believe that they  need loads of stuff. 

In reality we could survive with a lot less.” 

In  addition,  it  was  questioned  (both  by  the  ordinary 
people and the people working with the IOT) if people are 
aware of the potential problems that may occur. 

“It’s scary how few people are preparing for the IOT.” 

 
 

“Orwell's 1984 is here.” 

4. Conclusion 

In  this  research,  22  people  were  interviewed  about  the 
IOT in Finland. Out of the 22 answerers, 11 were working 
with  the  IOT  and  11  were  ordinary  people,  who  were  not 
yet  so  familiar  with  the  concept.  This  paper  presents  the 
collected  answers  to  5  questions  and  highlights  of  the  free 
comments.  Most  of  the  answerers  believed  that  we  are 
heading  towards  the  IOT  in  the  future.  According  to  these 
answers, many future IOT applications were seen tempting, 
but  the  necessity  of  the  huge  amount  of  new  applications 
was  also  questioned.  In  addition,  the  security  risks  and 
losing control your own individual privacy were seen as the 
main  barriers,  as  was  expected.  The  most  desired  applica-
tions  seem  to  be  those  related  to  health-monitoring  and 
applications  used  at  home.  In  general,  the  people  working 
with the IOT were found to be more critical towards it.
