Abstract—We  propose  SCYAMIX,  a  middleware  aimed  at 
facilitating 
experimentation  with 
Sensei/IoT*  standard  proposal  and  physical  processes  for  Smart 
Grid.  Sensei/IoT* represents the first joint effort involving ISO, 
IEC,  and  IEEE  to  provide  a  Semantic  Web  3.0  standard  for 
Sensor Networks, M2M and IoT. The proposed middleware fuses 
together  distributed  Sensei/IoT*-compliant 
communication 
architectures and protocols with real-time software simulators to 
enable  disruptive  cyber  security  experiments.  A  case  study  is 
presented  to  demonstrate  SCYAMIX’s  ability  to  recreate  Smart 
Grid  architectures  involving  complex  physical  processes  and 
cyber security scenarios.

Although the adoption of generic off-the-shelf ICT in Smart 
Grid provisions indisputable advantages and benefits, it raises 
several  issues  concerning  the  reliability  and  security  of 
communications  and  control  systems  –  the  core  infrastructure 
of  Smart  Grid.  The  impact  of  generic  malware  on  the  normal 
functioning of Industrial Control Systems (ICS – part of Smart 
Grid  core)  can  be  devastating  if  we  simply  consider  the 
published attack reports on ICS. Of course, the construction of 
a  comprehensive  list  of  events  and  attacks  is  difficult  to 
achieve  in  the  industrial  setting,  mainly  because  of  non-
disclosure  policies  adopted  by  different 
stakeholders. 
Therefore,  most  reported  events  cannot  be  chronologically 
ordered,  since  the  actual  discovery  date  of  malware  does  not 
coincide with the actual infection time of the system.  

Nevertheless, the year 2010 can be seen as a turning point in 
the  perception  of  security  in  the  industrial  setting.  This  is 
mainly  attributed  to  the  discovery  of  Stuxnet  [1],  the  first 
malware  specifically  designed  to  attack  ICS.  Stuxnet  is  also 
the  world’s  first  (discovered)  malware  capable  to  rewrite  the 
control logic of ICS hardware and to actually hide its presence

by  exploiting  several  zero-day  vulnerabilities.  Unfortunately, 
the discovery of systems infected with Stuxnet malware is not 
limited  to  the  year  2010  and  other  Stuxnet  targets  have  been 
discovered  at  different  power  plants  and  installations  from 
southern  Iran  in  2012  [2].  The  potential  impact  of  cyber 
attacks in the power sector has been highlighted by the Tempe, 
AZ incident [3] from 2007. In this particular case an improper 
configuration  of  load  shedding  programs  caused  the  opening 
of  141  breakers  and  a  loss  of  significant  load,  which 
subsequently  led  to  a  46  min  power  outage  affecting  almost 
100 000 customers. 

In  this  context,  the  deployment  of  effective  protective 
mechanisms  for  future  infrastructures  such  as  Smart  Grid 
requires  novel 
testing  facilities  with  complex  features 
embodying  the  cyber  and  physical  dimension  of  these  critical 
infrastructures.  To  address  this  issue,  a  substantial  number  of 
approaches have been documented in research publications. As 
such, we find a wide range of testbeds and middleware aimed 
at  facilitating  cyber-physical  security  experimentation  with 
Smart  Grid  and  other  industrial  infrastructures  [7-12].  In  the 
particular case of Smart Grid, a commonly addressed problem 
is  the  actual  architecture  and  protocols  which  will  enable  the

integration  of  different  communication  protocols  and 
standards.  The  paper  also  documents  the  successful  adoption 
and  application  of  International  Telecommunication  Union 
(ITU) USN/NGN to Smart Grid architecture. 

SeDAX 

(Secure  Data-centric  Application  eXtensible 
platform)  is  the  platform  proposed  by  Young-Jin  Kim,  et  al. 
[8,  9].  SeDAX  uses  Delaunay  Triangulation  (DT)  graphs  to 
provide and information-centric communication in the grid. Its 
architecture  focuses  on  data  availability  and  communication 
resilience  by  using  a  geographic  hash  forwarding  algorithm 
and  a  DT-based  data  replication  scheme.  The  algorithm  is 
evaluated  and  compared  with  other  geometric-based 
alternatives  based  on  route  tables  size,  message  overhead, 
delivery performance and replication cost. 

Zhou,  et  al.  [10]  introduced  a  new  performance  metric  – 
Accumulated Bandwidth Distance Product (ABDP) to evaluate 
communication  architectures  for  AMI  in  Smart  Grid.  The 
metric,  based  on  greedy  algorithm,  was  tested  on  Distributed 
MDMS (Meter Data Management System) architecture, a fully 
distributed  architecture  and  centralized  communication 
architecture. Results proved that distributed architectures have 
more benefits compared to centralized ones. 

Athreya  and  Tague  [11]  proposed  a  self-organizing  mesh 
hierarchy  to  assure  the  operability  of  AMI  during  outages 
based  on  a  distributed  Time  Division  Multiple  Access 
(TDMA).  The  model’s  performance  was  evaluated  using  a 
wireless  TDMA  modeler,  which  proved  to  assure  consistent 
performance during outages. 

Finally, we mention the work of Siaterlis, et al. [12], where 
a generic testbed was proposed to enable security studies with 
cyber-physical  systems.  The  approach  employed  emulation 
testbeds to recreate ICT hardware and software and the AMICI 
simulation  software  to  recreate  the  behavior  of  physical 
processes. 

Compared  to  the  previously  mentioned  approaches,  the 
novelty  of  the  middleware  proposed  in  this  paper  is  that  it 
enables cyber security experiments with an emerging standard, 
i.e.,  Sensei/IoT*,  ensuring  at  the  same  time  an  accurate

of  the  two  main  components  of  the  proposed  middleware:

A.  Sensei/IoT*: from XMPP to Smart Grid 

The  eXtensible  Messaging  and  Presence  Protocol  (XMPP) 
protocol,  developed  in  1999  by  the  Jabber  open-source 
community was intended for near real-time instant messaging, 
presence information, and contact list maintenance.  

The XMPP is an open eXtensible Markup Language (XML) 
protocol which defines the way of XML content streaming. It 
has  been  used  in  many  applications,  most  importantly  the 
Smart Grid in the case of the Internet of Things applications. 

Since  2002  the  XMPP  working  group  established  by 
Internet  Engineering  Task  Force  (IETF)  has  made  efforts  for 
standardization. Initially, four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 
3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923) were created that lead in 2004 to 
a  Proposed  Standard.  In  2011,  first  specifications  were 
replaced  by  RFC  6120  and  RFC  6121,  and  new  ones  were 
added such as RFC 6122. 

Besides  the  mentioned  core  protocols,  the  XMPP  Standard 
Foundation  takes  part  at  the  new  open  XMPP  extensions 
development  also  known  as  XEP  stanzas.  These  are  not 
singular and therefore joint attempts for global, open standards 
among  global  players  are  noticed.  We  mention  here  the 
ISO/IEC/IEEE  P21451-1-4  XMPP  standard,  outlined  in  the 
following sub-sections. 

1)  ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 XMPP Overview 

ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 XMPP Interface Standard is also 
known  as  Sensei/IoT*  and  represents  the  first  joint  effort 
amongst  ISO,  IEC,  and  IEEE  to  design  a  Semantic  Web  3.0 
Sensor Standard for Sensor Networks, M2M and IoT. 

The main goal of the Sensei/IoT* standard is to demonstrate 
the assured interoperability, scalability, and security  using the 
XMPP  protocol.  The  scope  of  the  standard  concerning  Smart 
Grid  can  be  summarized  in  the  following  main  points:  (i) 
electric power generation by offering access to data sharing on 
energy usage, primary energy cost or greenhouse gas emission; 
(ii) renewable energy based generation and storage systems by 
offering  access  to  data  concerning  the  primary  energy  and 
stored  energy  availability;  (iii)  transmission  system  on  lines 
and  busses  fault  detection;  (iv)  distribution  system  on 
microgrid  integration  and  substation  controls;  (v)  consumer 
side  on  using  smart  metering,  the  management  of  the  local 
generation and storage capabilities.

A.  Sensei/IoT*: from XMPP to Smart Grid 

The  eXtensible  Messaging  and  Presence  Protocol  (XMPP) 
protocol,  developed  in  1999  by  the  Jabber  open-source 
community was intended for near real-time instant messaging, 
presence information, and contact list maintenance.  

The XMPP is an open eXtensible Markup Language (XML) 
protocol which defines the way of XML content streaming. It 
has  been  used  in  many  applications,  most  importantly  the 
Smart Grid in the case of the Internet of Things applications. 

Since  2002  the  XMPP  working  group  established  by 
Internet  Engineering  Task  Force  (IETF)  has  made  efforts  for 
standardization. Initially, four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 
3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923) were created that lead in 2004 to 
a  Proposed  Standard.  In  2011,  first  specifications  were 
replaced  by  RFC  6120  and  RFC  6121,  and  new  ones  were 
added such as RFC 6122. 

Besides  the  mentioned  core  protocols,  the  XMPP  Standard 
Foundation  takes  part  at  the  new  open  XMPP  extensions 
development  also  known  as  XEP  stanzas.  These  are  not 
singular and therefore joint attempts for global, open standards 
among  global  players  are  noticed.  We  mention  here  the 
ISO/IEC/IEEE  P21451-1-4  XMPP  standard,  outlined  in  the 
following sub-sections. 

1)  ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 XMPP Overview 

ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 XMPP Interface Standard is also 
known  as  Sensei/IoT*  and  represents  the  first  joint  effort 
amongst  ISO,  IEC,  and  IEEE  to  design  a  Semantic  Web  3.0 
Sensor Standard for Sensor Networks, M2M and IoT. 

The main goal of the Sensei/IoT* standard is to demonstrate 
the assured interoperability, scalability, and security  using the 
XMPP  protocol.  The  scope  of  the  standard  concerning  Smart 
Grid  can  be  summarized  in  the  following  main  points:  (i) 
electric power generation by offering access to data sharing on 
energy usage, primary energy cost or greenhouse gas emission; 
(ii) renewable energy based generation and storage systems by 
offering  access  to  data  concerning  the  primary  energy  and 
stored  energy  availability;  (iii)  transmission  system  on  lines 
and  busses  fault  detection;  (iv)  distribution  system  on 
microgrid  integration  and  substation  controls;  (v)  consumer 
side  on  using  smart  metering,  the  management  of  the  local 
generation and storage capabilities.

must  answer  a  series  of  key  challenges  concerning: 
effectiveness  of  Internet  usage,  interoperability,  scalability, 
session  persistency,  cyber  vulnerability,  cyber  exposure, 
presence detection, security, etc. Many of these challenges are 
covered  by  the  new  proposed  standard.  We  mention  some  of 
these features: 
-  technology agnostic and protocol independent; 
-  the use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) for data traffic 

encryption built into the protocol; 

-  Meta  Data  Isolation  (MDI)  and  intrusion  protection against 

cyber-attacks; 

-  usage of the Semantic Web 3.0 based on XML metadata for 

providing semantic conversation between devices; 

-  usage  of  a  Service  Broker  as  a  trusted  intermediary  to 
establish a trust relationship between users, applications, and 
devices; 

make  it  a  good  candidate  for  industrial  applications.  The 
platform  uses  XMPP  for  meta-data  exchange  (like  session 
initiation, device managing requests, etc.) and small structured 
data generated by endpoints (e.g., events: a switch changes its 
state,  an  alarm  sensor  detects  movement).  For  high  quantity, 
binary  data,  e.g.,  video  and  audio  streams,  an  out-of-band 
protocol  is  used  depending  on  the  type  of  stream.  At  the 
highest  level  there  is  a  set  of  interconnected  XMPP  servers 
running  over  the  Internet.  The  distribution  of  the  XMPP 
servers  ensures  proper  load  distribution,  interconnection 
between resources managed by different authorities. 

On  the  XMPP  server  level  the  proposed  platform  features 
are  implemented  in  a  server  side  component  which  exposes 
basic  and  common  functionalities  to  be  used  by  the  other 
modules. Those functionalities include: 
-  communication  with the XMPP server and message routing 

-  possibility  to  use  an  Identity  Provider  (IdP)  in  order  to 

between the connected nodes; 

provide Single Sign On (SSO); 

-  support  end-to-end  digital  signing  and  encryption  based  on 

RFC 3923 Efficient XML Interchange (EXI). 
3)  Remarks on Using Sensei/IoT* standard 
Adopting in the existing or newly emerging Smart Grid the 
Sensei/IoT*  standard  can  provide  a  series  of  benefits  such  as 
interoperability, scalability and security. It can be used at any 
level of a Smart Grid allowing the harmonization of protocols 
by enabling operation between new and legacy protocols. 

Many  advantages  are  given  by  the  characteristics  of  the 
XMPP  protocol:  the  technology  and  protocol  independence 
allows decreasing costs and complexity; XMPP can facilitate a 
transition 
to  new  IEC  standards;  XMPP  offers  trusted 
messages  transmission  solutions  and  an  easy  usage  in  case  of 
dynamic  addressing  issues;  it  has  built-in  cyber  security 
protection mechanisms. 

B.  HERMIX Platform 

The  HERMIX  platform 

[4]  developed  by  Vitheia 
consortium  was  designed  to  collect,  store  and  analyze  large 
amount of data coming from a diversity of nodes, ranging from 
sensors to high resolution cameras. 

it 

The platform can be viewed as a set of interconnected nodes 
(physical resources, users, automation scripts, services) with a 
layered  architecture.  Every  node  represents  an  information 
provider  or  a  consumer.  The  logical  management  layer  has  a 
service  oriented  architecture  and 
is  responsible  for 
formatting  and  extracting  the  data,  for  automatic  analysis  and 
processing. This layer also manages the proper authentication, 
authorization  and  access  control  mechanisms  and  assures  the 
interconnection with other systems. The lower communication 
layer uses the event-driven architecture that follows a publish-
subscribe  pattern  for  small  and  structured  data  exchanges 
between  nodes.  The  data  storage  layer  hides  the  used 
underlying  database  system  and  at  the  same  time  it  provides 
storage support for this hybrid communication model. 

The  features  embedded  within  XMPP,  including  federation 
across  domains,  authentication,  end-to-end  signing,  object 
encryption  and  its  security  support  even  for  mobile endpoints

-  interconnection with the physical bus; 
-  authorization management; 
-  persistent storage. 

the  physical  devices 

To  assure  the  interoperability  between  different  vendors' 
specific  devices  a  dedicated  module  needs  to  be  created  for 
every  type  of  industrial  bus  (e.g.,  LON,  CAN,  EIB,  Modbus, 
etc.).  The  module  communicates  with  the  specific  bus  and 
transforms 
into  node 
representation.  The  node  is  not  necessarily  hosted  on  the 
resource itself, it acts as a host for a set of resources connected 
to the same bus. The module and the delegate nodes assure the 
protection  of  the  low  capability  resources,  e.g.,  low  power 
sensor  nodes,  from  external  attacks  implementing  proper 
authorization and encryption mechanism. 

information 

A node identified in XMPP world by  a unique JID (Jabber 
ID) is defined by a set of features, status information, received 
commands,  and  generated  events.  Taking  into  account  the 
heterogeneity  of  existing  protocols,  new 
types  can  be 
described,  but  the  main  goal  of  this  resource  model  is  to 
provide  homogeneity  at  the  description  level.  A  node  can  be 
dynamically  created  by  the  Node  Manager  based  on an XML 
description or based on the image saved in the database.  The 
Node  Manager  collects  and  saves  automatically  every 
modification in the registered node data in the Object Archive. 
When  a  saved  data  is  required,  it  is  loaded  into  memory  and 
transformed into its runtime C++ representation. 

The  discovery  mechanism  is  used  to  obtain  information 
about  devices,  their  features  or  events,  using  the  standard 
Service  Discovery  protocol  defined  in  the  XMPP  extension 
XEP-0030  [13].  The  state  is  divided  into  several  parts  to 
assign  different  privilege  levels  to  the  state  variables.  The 
events  are  also  organized  hierarchically  and  different  events 
require  different  privileges  to  subscribe  to  them.  A  user 
subscribing  to  a  collection  node  (an  event  node  tree)  will 
receive  events  generated  by  all  the  descendants  of  the 
collection node.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

N 

OWADAYS,  Smart  Grid  is  commonly  recognized  as  the 
next  generation  power  grid.  Through  the  pervasive 
adoption  of  modern 
Information  and  Communication 
Technologies (ICT), Smart Grid improves operational benefits 
of  control,  reliability  and  safety,  and  provides  advanced  two-
way 
of 
heterogeneous measurement and sensor-actuator networks. 

communication,  more 

integration 

flexible 

Although the adoption of generic off-the-shelf ICT in Smart 
Grid provisions indisputable advantages and benefits, it raises 
several  issues  concerning  the  reliability  and  security  of 
communications  and  control  systems  –  the  core  infrastructure 
of  Smart  Grid.  The  impact  of  generic  malware  on  the  normal 
functioning of Industrial Control Systems (ICS – part of Smart 
Grid  core)  can  be  devastating  if  we  simply  consider  the 
published attack reports on ICS. Of course, the construction of 
a  comprehensive  list  of  events  and  attacks  is  difficult  to 
achieve  in  the  industrial  setting,  mainly  because  of  non-
disclosure  policies  adopted  by  different 
stakeholders. 
Therefore,  most  reported  events  cannot  be  chronologically 
ordered,  since  the  actual  discovery  date  of  malware  does  not 
coincide with the actual infection time of the system.  

Nevertheless, the year 2010 can be seen as a turning point in 
the  perception  of  security  in  the  industrial  setting.  This  is 
mainly  attributed  to  the  discovery  of  Stuxnet  [1],  the  first 
malware  specifically  designed  to  attack  ICS.  Stuxnet  is  also 
the  world’s  first  (discovered)  malware  capable  to  rewrite  the 
control logic of ICS hardware and to actually hide its presence 

1 

by  exploiting  several  zero-day  vulnerabilities.  Unfortunately, 
the discovery of systems infected with Stuxnet malware is not 
limited  to  the  year  2010  and  other  Stuxnet  targets  have  been 
discovered  at  different  power  plants  and  installations  from 
southern  Iran  in  2012  [2].  The  potential  impact  of  cyber 
attacks in the power sector has been highlighted by the Tempe, 
AZ incident [3] from 2007. In this particular case an improper 
configuration  of  load  shedding  programs  caused  the  opening 
of  141  breakers  and  a  loss  of  significant  load,  which 
subsequently  led  to  a  46  min  power  outage  affecting  almost 
100 000 customers. 

In  this  context,  the  deployment  of  effective  protective 
mechanisms  for  future  infrastructures  such  as  Smart  Grid 
requires  novel 
testing  facilities  with  complex  features 
embodying  the  cyber  and  physical  dimension  of  these  critical 
infrastructures.  To  address  this  issue,  a  substantial  number  of 
approaches have been documented in research publications. As 
such, we find a wide range of testbeds and middleware aimed 
at  facilitating  cyber-physical  security  experimentation  with 
Smart  Grid  and  other  industrial  infrastructures  [7-12].  In  the 
particular case of Smart Grid, a commonly addressed problem 
is  the  actual  architecture  and  protocols  which  will  enable  the 
deployment  of  large-scale  infrastructures  consisting  of  a  wide 
variety  of  devices  and  systems  such  as  Customer  Energy 
Management Systems (CEMS), Distributed Energy Resources 
(DER), Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), and so on.

In this section we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art 
for  Smart  Grid  architectures.  AMI  (Advanced  Metering 
Infrastructure)  is  an  important  part  of  the  Smart  Grid  system 
and  several  researches  have  been  carried  out  for  making  it

the 
communication  infrastructure  and  on  the  importance  of 
integration  of  different  communication  protocols  and 
standards.  The  paper  also  documents  the  successful  adoption 
and  application  of  International  Telecommunication  Union 
(ITU) USN/NGN to Smart Grid architecture. 

SeDAX 

(Secure  Data-centric  Application  eXtensible 
platform)  is  the  platform  proposed  by  Young-Jin  Kim,  et  al. 
[8,  9].  SeDAX  uses  Delaunay  Triangulation  (DT)  graphs  to 
provide and information-centric communication in the grid. Its 
architecture  focuses  on  data  availability  and  communication 
resilience  by  using  a  geographic  hash  forwarding  algorithm 
and  a  DT-based  data  replication  scheme.  The  algorithm  is 
evaluated  and  compared  with  other  geometric-based 
alternatives  based  on  route  tables  size,  message  overhead, 
delivery performance and replication cost. 

Zhou,  et  al.  [10]  introduced  a  new  performance  metric  – 
Accumulated Bandwidth Distance Product (ABDP) to evaluate 
communication  architectures  for  AMI  in  Smart  Grid.  The 
metric,  based  on  greedy  algorithm,  was  tested  on  Distributed 
MDMS (Meter Data Management System) architecture, a fully 
distributed  architecture  and  centralized  communication 
architecture. Results proved that distributed architectures have 
more benefits compared to centralized ones. 

Athreya  and  Tague  [11]  proposed  a  self-organizing  mesh 
hierarchy  to  assure  the  operability  of  AMI  during  outages 
based  on  a  distributed  Time  Division  Multiple  Access 
(TDMA).  The  model’s  performance  was  evaluated  using  a 
wireless  TDMA  modeler,  which  proved  to  assure  consistent 
performance during outages. 

Finally, we mention the work of Siaterlis, et al. [12], where 
a generic testbed was proposed to enable security studies with 
cyber-physical  systems.  The  approach  employed  emulation 
testbeds to recreate ICT hardware and software and the AMICI 
simulation  software  to  recreate  the  behavior  of  physical 
processes. 

Compared  to  the  previously  mentioned  approaches,  the 
novelty  of  the  middleware  proposed  in  this  paper  is  that  it 
enables cyber security experiments with an emerging standard, 
i.e.,  Sensei/IoT*,  ensuring  at  the  same  time  an  accurate

types  can  be 
described,  but  the  main  goal  of  this  resource  model  is  to 
provide  homogeneity  at  the  description  level.  A  node  can  be 
dynamically  created  by  the  Node  Manager  based  on an XML 
description or based on the image saved in the database.  The 
Node  Manager  collects  and  saves  automatically  every 
modification in the registered node data in the Object Archive. 
When  a  saved  data  is  required,  it  is  loaded  into  memory  and 
transformed into its runtime C++ representation. 

The  discovery  mechanism  is  used  to  obtain  information 
about  devices,  their  features  or  events,  using  the  standard 
Service  Discovery  protocol  defined  in  the  XMPP  extension 
XEP-0030  [13].  The  state  is  divided  into  several  parts  to 
assign  different  privilege  levels  to  the  state  variables.  The 
events  are  also  organized  hierarchically  and  different  events 
require  different  privileges  to  subscribe  to  them.  A  user 
subscribing  to  a  collection  node  (an  event  node  tree)  will 
receive  events  generated  by  all  the  descendants  of  the 
collection node. 

The  transport  of  the  binary  data  from  a  source  to  multiple 

destinations is handled by the Controller nodes. The access to 
the  binary  archives  is  also  done  indirectly,  through  the 
controllers. The Controller poses two types of communication 
channels: one for controlling the way data is distributed based 
on  XMPP  protocol;  other  for  actual  large  data  transport.  The 
controller  is  exposed  in  middleware  as  a  delegated  node 
attached to a component.   

The  Object  Manager  also  enforces  permission  policies 
managed by an Authorization Manager. Permission attached to 
an  object  is  represented  as  a  set  of  tuples  (object  id,  list  of 
permission types, a set of bare JIDs, set of groups). When the 
Object Manager needs to authorize access to an object, it will 
request  the  object’s  access  control  list  (if  not already cached) 
from  the  Authorization  Manager.  The  maximum  caching 
interval is imposed by the Authorization Manager and must be 
invalidated  if  it  is  changed.  Separation  between  permission 
validation  and  permission  management assures the third-party 
integration. 

C.  AMICI Platform 

The  Assessment  platform 

for  Multiple  Interdependent 
Critical  Infrastructures  (AMICI)  [5]  provides  software 
simulators  to  recreate  the  physical  dimension  of  critical 
infrastructures  such  as  Smart  Grid.  AMICI  was  developed 
from 
real-time  multi-model 
experimentation  capabilities  supporting  cyber  security  studies 
concerning critical infrastructures. Its architecture, depicted in 
Figure  1,  includes  two  main  components:  a  simulation  unit 
denoted as Sim; and a proxy unit, denoted as Proxy. 

provide

to 

the  difference  between 

The  main  role  of  the  simulation  unit  (Sim)  is  to  run  the 
physical  process  model  in  real-time.  This  is  achieved  by 
coupling  the  model  time  to  the  system  in  such  a  way  to 
minimize 
two.  Models  are 
constructed in Matlab Simulink from where the corresponding 
‘C’  code  is  generated  using  Simulink  Coder.  These  are  then 
integrated  using  an  XML  configuration  file  that  provides  the 
required  flexibility  so  that  researchers  do  not  need  to  modify 
AMICI’s source code. 

the 

From the Sim unit’s point of view each model is seen as a set 
of inputs and outputs. These are mapped to an internal memory 
region  (I/O  MEM)  that  is  read/written  by  other  software 
modules as well. The Sim unit allows an open access to its I/O 
MEM  by  implementing  OS  level  shared  memory  operations. 
This way, AMICI enables interaction with ad-hoc software that 
can  write  specific  model  inputs,  i.e.,  OPEN/CLOSE  a  valve, 
and  can  read  the  status  of  the  model,  i.e.,  measured  voltage. 
Interaction  with  other  Sim  units  is  enabled  by  implementing 
not only RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server-side operations 
but  client-side  calls  as  well.  By  using  only  the  XML 
configuration file, the Sim unit can be configured to read/write 
inputs/outputs  of  models  run  by  remote  Sim  units.  These  are 
mapped  to  the  inputs/outputs  of  the  model  running  locally, 
enabling  complex  interactions  between  models  running  in 
parallel  on  different  machines.  The  Proxy  unit  has  several 
roles within AMICI. First of all, it is able to run remote control 
code,  thus  enabling  the  integration  of  more  complex  control 
hardware emulators. At the same time, it can be used to handle

Modbus  protocol  calls,  transforming  them  to  RPC  calls  and 
finally sending requests to the Sim unit.

As  demonstrated  in  [12],  AMICI  can  be  applied  to  a  wide 
range  of  security  experiments.  Its  software  units  have  been 
tested  with  several  physical  process  models  such  as  oil-fired 
electrical  power  plants,  chemical  processes,  railway  systems, 
and large-scale power grid models. AMICI’s software units are 
available as open source under EUPL license and can be freely

D.  SCYAMIX: Fusing HERMIX With AMICI 

We propose Smart grid CYber security assessment platform 
based on AMIci and hermiX (SCYAMIX), which fuses together 
the  communication  features  provided  by  HERMIX  with  the 
physical  process  simulation  capabilities  brought  by  AMICI. 
SCYAMIX  is  thus  able  to  provide  realistic  communication 
architectures  and  protocols  which  have  been  proved  to  be 
well-adapted  to  large  infrastructures  such  as  the  Smart  Grid 
[4]. At the same time SCYAMIX brings additional capabilities 
to  enable  the  recreation  of  the  physical  dimension,  which 
constitutes a significant component of any industrial system. 

Fundamentally,  from  an  architectural  point  of  view, 
SCYAMIX  provides  capabilities  to  recreate  the  cyber  and 
physical  dimension  of  Smart  Grid.  For  the  cyber  dimension 
SCYAMIX  adopts  HERMIX  to  provide  real  software  and 
protocols  running  on  real  networking  infrastructures.  This 
approach  is  well  established  in  the  field  of  cyber  security, 
since  the  use  of  real  infrastructures  provides  high  fidelity  of 
results  and  in  many  cases  it  can  capture  not  only  whether  a 
system will fail but also how it will fail. In contrast, the use of 
simulation  to  recreate  the  cyber  dimension  of  Smart  Grid 
would provide an effective approach to model normal network 
and  software  conditions,  but  it  would  fail  to  capture  the  way 
computer networks fail. This aspect has been well documented 
and studied by previous work [12, 14, 15, 17]. 

For  the  physical  dimension  SCYAMIX  uses  simulation 
since this provides an efficient, low-cost and safe approach to 
recreate  the  physical  dimension.  Apparently,  this  might  be 
interpreted  as  a  lack  of  realism  and  low  experiment  fidelity, 
however,  the  use  of  software  simulation  for  cyber  security 
experimentation  scenarios  enables  disruptive  experiments  on 
multiple heterogeneous physical processes.

Abstract—We  propose  SCYAMIX,  a  middleware  aimed  at 
facilitating 
experimentation  with 
Sensei/IoT*  standard  proposal  and  physical  processes  for  Smart 
Grid.  Sensei/IoT* represents the first joint effort involving ISO, 
IEC,  and  IEEE  to  provide  a  Semantic  Web  3.0  standard  for 
Sensor Networks, M2M and IoT. The proposed middleware fuses 
together  distributed  Sensei/IoT*-compliant 
communication 
architectures and protocols with real-time software simulators to 
enable  disruptive  cyber  security  experiments.  A  case  study  is 
presented  to  demonstrate  SCYAMIX’s  ability  to  recreate  Smart 
Grid  architectures  involving  complex  physical  processes  and 
cyber security scenarios.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

N 

OWADAYS,  Smart  Grid  is  commonly  recognized  as  the 
next  generation  power  grid.  Through  the  pervasive 
adoption  of  modern 
Information  and  Communication 
Technologies (ICT), Smart Grid improves operational benefits 
of  control,  reliability  and  safety,  and  provides  advanced  two-
way 
of 
heterogeneous measurement and sensor-actuator networks. 

communication,  more 

integration 

flexible 

Although the adoption of generic off-the-shelf ICT in Smart 
Grid provisions indisputable advantages and benefits, it raises 
several  issues  concerning  the  reliability  and  security  of 
communications  and  control  systems  –  the  core  infrastructure 
of  Smart  Grid.  The  impact  of  generic  malware  on  the  normal 
functioning of Industrial Control Systems (ICS – part of Smart 
Grid  core)  can  be  devastating  if  we  simply  consider  the 
published attack reports on ICS. Of course, the construction of 
a  comprehensive  list  of  events  and  attacks  is  difficult  to 
achieve  in  the  industrial  setting,  mainly  because  of  non-
disclosure  policies  adopted  by  different 
stakeholders. 
Therefore,  most  reported  events  cannot  be  chronologically 
ordered,  since  the  actual  discovery  date  of  malware  does  not 
coincide with the actual infection time of the system.  

Nevertheless, the year 2010 can be seen as a turning point in 
the  perception  of  security  in  the  industrial  setting.  This  is 
mainly  attributed  to  the  discovery  of  Stuxnet  [1],  the  first 
malware  specifically  designed  to  attack  ICS.  Stuxnet  is  also 
the  world’s  first  (discovered)  malware  capable  to  rewrite  the 
control logic of ICS hardware and to actually hide its presence 

1 

by  exploiting  several  zero-day  vulnerabilities.  Unfortunately, 
the discovery of systems infected with Stuxnet malware is not 
limited  to  the  year  2010  and  other  Stuxnet  targets  have  been 
discovered  at  different  power  plants  and  installations  from 
southern  Iran  in  2012  [2].  The  potential  impact  of  cyber 
attacks in the power sector has been highlighted by the Tempe, 
AZ incident [3] from 2007. In this particular case an improper 
configuration  of  load  shedding  programs  caused  the  opening 
of  141  breakers  and  a  loss  of  significant  load,  which 
subsequently  led  to  a  46  min  power  outage  affecting  almost 
100 000 customers. 

In  this  context,  the  deployment  of  effective  protective 
mechanisms  for  future  infrastructures  such  as  Smart  Grid 
requires  novel 
testing  facilities  with  complex  features 
embodying  the  cyber  and  physical  dimension  of  these  critical 
infrastructures.  To  address  this  issue,  a  substantial  number  of 
approaches have been documented in research publications. As 
such, we find a wide range of testbeds and middleware aimed 
at  facilitating  cyber-physical  security  experimentation  with 
Smart  Grid  and  other  industrial  infrastructures  [7-12].  In  the 
particular case of Smart Grid, a commonly addressed problem 
is  the  actual  architecture  and  protocols  which  will  enable  the 
deployment  of  large-scale  infrastructures  consisting  of  a  wide 
variety  of  devices  and  systems  such  as  Customer  Energy 
Management Systems (CEMS), Distributed Energy Resources 
(DER), Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), and so on.

concerning a specific cyber security case study is presented in

II.  RELATED WORK 

In this section we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art 
for  Smart  Grid  architectures.  AMI  (Advanced  Metering 
Infrastructure)  is  an  important  part  of  the  Smart  Grid  system 
and  several  researches  have  been  carried  out  for  making  it 
scalable and operational during outages. 

is  proposed.  The  authors  concentrate  on 

In the work of Zaballos,  et al. [7], an architecture based on 
wireless  networks  and  communication  power  lines  for  Smart 
Grids 
the 
communication  infrastructure  and  on  the  importance  of 
integration  of  different  communication  protocols  and 
standards.  The  paper  also  documents  the  successful  adoption 
and  application  of  International  Telecommunication  Union 
(ITU) USN/NGN to Smart Grid architecture. 

SeDAX 

(Secure  Data-centric  Application  eXtensible 
platform)  is  the  platform  proposed  by  Young-Jin  Kim,  et  al. 
[8,  9].  SeDAX  uses  Delaunay  Triangulation  (DT)  graphs  to 
provide and information-centric communication in the grid. Its 
architecture  focuses  on  data  availability  and  communication 
resilience  by  using  a  geographic  hash  forwarding  algorithm 
and  a  DT-based  data  replication  scheme.  The  algorithm  is 
evaluated  and  compared  with  other  geometric-based 
alternatives  based  on  route  tables  size,  message  overhead, 
delivery performance and replication cost. 

Zhou,  et  al.  [10]  introduced  a  new  performance  metric  – 
Accumulated Bandwidth Distance Product (ABDP) to evaluate 
communication  architectures  for  AMI  in  Smart  Grid.  The 
metric,  based  on  greedy  algorithm,  was  tested  on  Distributed 
MDMS (Meter Data Management System) architecture, a fully 
distributed  architecture  and  centralized  communication 
architecture. Results proved that distributed architectures have 
more benefits compared to centralized ones. 

Athreya  and  Tague  [11]  proposed  a  self-organizing  mesh 
hierarchy  to  assure  the  operability  of  AMI  during  outages 
based  on  a  distributed  Time  Division  Multiple  Access 
(TDMA).  The  model’s  performance  was  evaluated  using  a 
wireless  TDMA  modeler,  which  proved  to  assure  consistent 
performance during outages. 

Finally, we mention the work of Siaterlis, et al. [12], where 
a generic testbed was proposed to enable security studies with 
cyber-physical  systems.  The  approach  employed  emulation 
testbeds to recreate ICT hardware and software and the AMICI 
simulation  software  to  recreate  the  behavior  of  physical 
processes. 

Compared  to  the  previously  mentioned  approaches,  the 
novelty  of  the  middleware  proposed  in  this  paper  is  that  it 
enables cyber security experiments with an emerging standard, 
i.e.,  Sensei/IoT*,  ensuring  at  the  same  time  an  accurate 

III.  ARCHITECTURE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED 

MIDDLEWARE 

In  this  section  we  provide  a  description  of  the  proposed 
middleware.  We  start  with  an  overview  of  the  emerging 
Sensei/IoT* standard and we continue with a brief presentation 
of  the  two  main  components  of  the  proposed  middleware: 
HERMIX  and  AMICI.  Finally,  we  present  the  proposed 
architecture  which  fuses  several  technologies  and  software  to 
enable  a  wide 
for  cyber  security 
experimentation with Smart Grid. 

range  of 

features 

A.  Sensei/IoT*: from XMPP to Smart Grid 

The  eXtensible  Messaging  and  Presence  Protocol  (XMPP) 
protocol,  developed  in  1999  by  the  Jabber  open-source 
community was intended for near real-time instant messaging, 
presence information, and contact list maintenance.  

The XMPP is an open eXtensible Markup Language (XML) 
protocol which defines the way of XML content streaming. It 
has  been  used  in  many  applications,  most  importantly  the 
Smart Grid in the case of the Internet of Things applications. 

Since  2002  the  XMPP  working  group  established  by 
Internet  Engineering  Task  Force  (IETF)  has  made  efforts  for 
standardization. Initially, four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 
3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923) were created that lead in 2004 to 
a  Proposed  Standard.  In  2011,  first  specifications  were 
replaced  by  RFC  6120  and  RFC  6121,  and  new  ones  were 
added such as RFC 6122. 

Besides  the  mentioned  core  protocols,  the  XMPP  Standard 
Foundation  takes  part  at  the  new  open  XMPP  extensions 
development  also  known  as  XEP  stanzas.  These  are  not 
singular and therefore joint attempts for global, open standards 
among  global  players  are  noticed.  We  mention  here  the 
ISO/IEC/IEEE  P21451-1-4  XMPP  standard,  outlined  in  the 
following sub-sections. 

1)  ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 XMPP Overview 

ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 XMPP Interface Standard is also 
known  as  Sensei/IoT*  and  represents  the  first  joint  effort 
amongst  ISO,  IEC,  and  IEEE  to  design  a  Semantic  Web  3.0 
Sensor Standard for Sensor Networks, M2M and IoT. 

The main goal of the Sensei/IoT* standard is to demonstrate 
the assured interoperability, scalability, and security  using the 
XMPP  protocol.  The  scope  of  the  standard  concerning  Smart 
Grid  can  be  summarized  in  the  following  main  points:  (i) 
electric power generation by offering access to data sharing on 
energy usage, primary energy cost or greenhouse gas emission; 
(ii) renewable energy based generation and storage systems by 
offering  access  to  data  concerning  the  primary  energy  and 
stored  energy  availability;  (iii)  transmission  system  on  lines 
and  busses  fault  detection;  (iv)  distribution  system  on 
microgrid  integration  and  substation  controls;  (v)  consumer 
side  on  using  smart  metering,  the  management  of  the  local 
generation and storage capabilities. 
2)  Sensei/IoT* Main Features 
Smart  grid  implementation  based  on  Sensei/IoT*  standard

Preparation of Papers for ISDFS’2013 Symposium 
 

must  answer  a  series  of  key  challenges  concerning: 
effectiveness  of  Internet  usage,  interoperability,  scalability, 
session  persistency,  cyber  vulnerability,  cyber  exposure, 
presence detection, security, etc. Many of these challenges are 
covered  by  the  new  proposed  standard.  We  mention  some  of 
these features: 
-  technology agnostic and protocol independent; 
-  the use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) for data traffic 

encryption built into the protocol; 

-  Meta  Data  Isolation  (MDI)  and  intrusion  protection against 

cyber-attacks; 

-  usage of the Semantic Web 3.0 based on XML metadata for 

providing semantic conversation between devices; 

-  usage  of  a  Service  Broker  as  a  trusted  intermediary  to 
establish a trust relationship between users, applications, and 
devices; 

make  it  a  good  candidate  for  industrial  applications.  The 
platform  uses  XMPP  for  meta-data  exchange  (like  session 
initiation, device managing requests, etc.) and small structured 
data generated by endpoints (e.g., events: a switch changes its 
state,  an  alarm  sensor  detects  movement).  For  high  quantity, 
binary  data,  e.g.,  video  and  audio  streams,  an  out-of-band 
protocol  is  used  depending  on  the  type  of  stream.  At  the 
highest  level  there  is  a  set  of  interconnected  XMPP  servers 
running  over  the  Internet.  The  distribution  of  the  XMPP 
servers  ensures  proper  load  distribution,  interconnection 
between resources managed by different authorities. 

On  the  XMPP  server  level  the  proposed  platform  features 
are  implemented  in  a  server  side  component  which  exposes 
basic  and  common  functionalities  to  be  used  by  the  other 
modules. Those functionalities include: 
-  communication  with the XMPP server and message routing 

-  possibility  to  use  an  Identity  Provider  (IdP)  in  order  to 

between the connected nodes; 

provide Single Sign On (SSO); 

-  support  end-to-end  digital  signing  and  encryption  based  on 

RFC 3923 Efficient XML Interchange (EXI). 
3)  Remarks on Using Sensei/IoT* standard 
Adopting in the existing or newly emerging Smart Grid the 
Sensei/IoT*  standard  can  provide  a  series  of  benefits  such  as 
interoperability, scalability and security. It can be used at any 
level of a Smart Grid allowing the harmonization of protocols 
by enabling operation between new and legacy protocols. 

Many  advantages  are  given  by  the  characteristics  of  the 
XMPP  protocol:  the  technology  and  protocol  independence 
allows decreasing costs and complexity; XMPP can facilitate a 
transition 
to  new  IEC  standards;  XMPP  offers  trusted 
messages  transmission  solutions  and  an  easy  usage  in  case  of 
dynamic  addressing  issues;  it  has  built-in  cyber  security 
protection mechanisms. 

B.  HERMIX Platform 

The  HERMIX  platform 

[4]  developed  by  Vitheia 
consortium  was  designed  to  collect,  store  and  analyze  large 
amount of data coming from a diversity of nodes, ranging from 
sensors to high resolution cameras. 

it 

The platform can be viewed as a set of interconnected nodes 
(physical resources, users, automation scripts, services) with a 
layered  architecture.  Every  node  represents  an  information 
provider  or  a  consumer.  The  logical  management  layer  has  a 
service  oriented  architecture  and 
is  responsible  for 
formatting  and  extracting  the  data,  for  automatic  analysis  and 
processing. This layer also manages the proper authentication, 
authorization  and  access  control  mechanisms  and  assures  the 
interconnection with other systems. The lower communication 
layer uses the event-driven architecture that follows a publish-
subscribe  pattern  for  small  and  structured  data  exchanges 
between  nodes.  The  data  storage  layer  hides  the  used 
underlying  database  system  and  at  the  same  time  it  provides 
storage support for this hybrid communication model. 

The  features  embedded  within  XMPP,  including  federation 
across  domains,  authentication,  end-to-end  signing,  object 
encryption  and  its  security  support  even  for  mobile endpoints

-  node management; 
-  interconnection with the physical bus; 
-  authorization management; 
-  persistent storage. 

the  physical  devices 

To  assure  the  interoperability  between  different  vendors' 
specific  devices  a  dedicated  module  needs  to  be  created  for 
every  type  of  industrial  bus  (e.g.,  LON,  CAN,  EIB,  Modbus, 
etc.).  The  module  communicates  with  the  specific  bus  and 
transforms 
into  node 
representation.  The  node  is  not  necessarily  hosted  on  the 
resource itself, it acts as a host for a set of resources connected 
to the same bus. The module and the delegate nodes assure the 
protection  of  the  low  capability  resources,  e.g.,  low  power 
sensor  nodes,  from  external  attacks  implementing  proper 
authorization and encryption mechanism. 

information 

A node identified in XMPP world by  a unique JID (Jabber 
ID) is defined by a set of features, status information, received 
commands,  and  generated  events.  Taking  into  account  the 
heterogeneity  of  existing  protocols,  new 
types  can  be 
described,  but  the  main  goal  of  this  resource  model  is  to 
provide  homogeneity  at  the  description  level.  A  node  can  be 
dynamically  created  by  the  Node  Manager  based  on an XML 
description or based on the image saved in the database.  The 
Node  Manager  collects  and  saves  automatically  every 
modification in the registered node data in the Object Archive. 
When  a  saved  data  is  required,  it  is  loaded  into  memory  and 
transformed into its runtime C++ representation. 

The  discovery  mechanism  is  used  to  obtain  information 
about  devices,  their  features  or  events,  using  the  standard 
Service  Discovery  protocol  defined  in  the  XMPP  extension 
XEP-0030  [13].  The  state  is  divided  into  several  parts  to 
assign  different  privilege  levels  to  the  state  variables.  The 
events  are  also  organized  hierarchically  and  different  events 
require  different  privileges  to  subscribe  to  them.  A  user 
subscribing  to  a  collection  node  (an  event  node  tree)  will 
receive  events  generated  by  all  the  descendants  of  the 
collection node. 

The  transport  of  the  binary  data  from  a  source  to  multiple 

destinations is handled by the Controller nodes. The access to 
the  binary  archives  is  also  done  indirectly,  through  the 
controllers. The Controller poses two types of communication 
channels: one for controlling the way data is distributed based 
on  XMPP  protocol;  other  for  actual  large  data  transport.  The 
controller  is  exposed  in  middleware  as  a  delegated  node 
attached to a component.   

The  Object  Manager  also  enforces  permission  policies 
managed by an Authorization Manager. Permission attached to 
an  object  is  represented  as  a  set  of  tuples  (object  id,  list  of 
permission types, a set of bare JIDs, set of groups). When the 
Object Manager needs to authorize access to an object, it will 
request  the  object’s  access  control  list  (if  not already cached) 
from  the  Authorization  Manager.  The  maximum  caching 
interval is imposed by the Authorization Manager and must be 
invalidated  if  it  is  changed.  Separation  between  permission 
validation  and  permission  management assures the third-party 
integration. 

C.  AMICI Platform 

The  Assessment  platform 

for  Multiple  Interdependent 
Critical  Infrastructures  (AMICI)  [5]  provides  software 
simulators  to  recreate  the  physical  dimension  of  critical 
infrastructures  such  as  Smart  Grid.  AMICI  was  developed 
from 
real-time  multi-model 
experimentation  capabilities  supporting  cyber  security  studies 
concerning critical infrastructures. Its architecture, depicted in 
Figure  1,  includes  two  main  components:  a  simulation  unit 
denoted as Sim; and a proxy unit, denoted as Proxy.

The  main  role  of  the  simulation  unit  (Sim)  is  to  run  the 
physical  process  model  in  real-time.  This  is  achieved  by 
coupling  the  model  time  to  the  system  in  such  a  way  to 
minimize 
two.  Models  are 
constructed in Matlab Simulink from where the corresponding 
‘C’  code  is  generated  using  Simulink  Coder.  These  are  then 
integrated  using  an  XML  configuration  file  that  provides  the 
required  flexibility  so  that  researchers  do  not  need  to  modify 
AMICI’s source code. 

the 

From the Sim unit’s point of view each model is seen as a set 
of inputs and outputs. These are mapped to an internal memory 
region  (I/O  MEM)  that  is  read/written  by  other  software 
modules as well. The Sim unit allows an open access to its I/O 
MEM  by  implementing  OS  level  shared  memory  operations. 
This way, AMICI enables interaction with ad-hoc software that 
can  write  specific  model  inputs,  i.e.,  OPEN/CLOSE  a  valve, 
and  can  read  the  status  of  the  model,  i.e.,  measured  voltage. 
Interaction  with  other  Sim  units  is  enabled  by  implementing 
not only RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server-side operations 
but  client-side  calls  as  well.  By  using  only  the  XML 
configuration file, the Sim unit can be configured to read/write 
inputs/outputs  of  models  run  by  remote  Sim  units.  These  are 
mapped  to  the  inputs/outputs  of  the  model  running  locally, 
enabling  complex  interactions  between  models  running  in 
parallel  on  different  machines.  The  Proxy  unit  has  several 
roles within AMICI. First of all, it is able to run remote control 
code,  thus  enabling  the  integration  of  more  complex  control 
hardware emulators. At the same time, it can be used to handle

Modbus  protocol  calls,  transforming  them  to  RPC  calls  and 
finally sending requests to the Sim unit.

As  demonstrated  in  [12],  AMICI  can  be  applied  to  a  wide 
range  of  security  experiments.  Its  software  units  have  been 
tested  with  several  physical  process  models  such  as  oil-fired 
electrical  power  plants,  chemical  processes,  railway  systems, 
and large-scale power grid models. AMICI’s software units are 
available as open source under EUPL license and can be freely

D.  SCYAMIX: Fusing HERMIX With AMICI 

We propose Smart grid CYber security assessment platform 
based on AMIci and hermiX (SCYAMIX), which fuses together 
the  communication  features  provided  by  HERMIX  with  the 
physical  process  simulation  capabilities  brought  by  AMICI. 
SCYAMIX  is  thus  able  to  provide  realistic  communication 
architectures  and  protocols  which  have  been  proved  to  be 
well-adapted  to  large  infrastructures  such  as  the  Smart  Grid 
[4]. At the same time SCYAMIX brings additional capabilities 
to  enable  the  recreation  of  the  physical  dimension,  which 
constitutes a significant component of any industrial system. 

Fundamentally,  from  an  architectural  point  of  view, 
SCYAMIX  provides  capabilities  to  recreate  the  cyber  and 
physical  dimension  of  Smart  Grid.  For  the  cyber  dimension 
SCYAMIX  adopts  HERMIX  to  provide  real  software  and 
protocols  running  on  real  networking  infrastructures.  This 
approach  is  well  established  in  the  field  of  cyber  security, 
since  the  use  of  real  infrastructures  provides  high  fidelity  of 
results  and  in  many  cases  it  can  capture  not  only  whether  a 
system will fail but also how it will fail. In contrast, the use of 
simulation  to  recreate  the  cyber  dimension  of  Smart  Grid 
would provide an effective approach to model normal network 
and  software  conditions,  but  it  would  fail  to  capture  the  way 
computer networks fail. This aspect has been well documented 
and studied by previous work [12, 14, 15, 17]. 

For  the  physical  dimension  SCYAMIX  uses  simulation 
since this provides an efficient, low-cost and safe approach to 
recreate  the  physical  dimension.  Apparently,  this  might  be 
interpreted  as  a  lack  of  realism  and  low  experiment  fidelity, 
however,  the  use  of  software  simulation  for  cyber  security 
experimentation  scenarios  enables  disruptive  experiments  on 
multiple heterogeneous physical processes.

This  is  not  possible  with  production  systems  since  security 
and  resilience  tests  entail  risks  of  potential  side  effects  to 
mission  critical  services  [16].  Furthermore,  today  several 
complex models are freely available and are actually applied in 
different  industries.  For  example, 
the  energy  sector 
simulation  has  become  so  accurate  and  trusted  that  it  is 
commonly  used  to  aid  decision  making  between  transmission 
system operators. 

in 

The  architecture  of  SCYAMIX,  as  a  result  of  fusing 
HERMIX  and  AMICI  is  depicted  in  Figure  2.  The  procedure 
followed  for  this  purpose  exploits  the  features  provided  by 
each of the two software platforms. As such, we implemented 
an  additional  HERMIX  module  to  access  the  shared  memory 
region  created by AMICI’s simulation unit. Model inputs and 
outputs  are  written  and  read  by  the  implemented  module, 
ensuring 
required  communication  between  cyber 
components and the simulated physical processes. 

the 

Devices  exposed  by  simulated  models,  e.g.,  valves  and 
sensors,  are  given  different  JIDs  and  are  accessed  through 
standard  XMPP  stanzas.  Each  device  is  registered  in  the 
HERMIX database (Mongodb) and users (client software) can 
subscribe  to  receive  events.  The  proposed  platform  is  thus 
compatible  with  any  client  software  implementing  an  XMPP 
communication interface according to the standard description. 
This provides a powerful feature and enables the integration of 
heterogeneous  software  which  can  interact  with  simulated 
physical processes in a wide range of scenarios. 

IV.   CASE STUDY 

In  this  section  we  present  a  case  study  showing  the 
applicability  of  the  proposed  middleware.  We  start  by 
presenting a description of the experiment setup and scenario, 
and we continue with the presentation of results. 

A.  Experiment Setup and Scenario 

The  aim  of  this  particular  scenario  is  to  illustrate  the 
interdependence  property  of  physical  processes  and  how  this 
property  can  be  used  to  detect  attacks/faults  by  indirect 
monitoring of process parameters. The experiment also shows 
the  applicability  of  the  proposed  middleware  in  constructing 
realistic  Smart  Grid  scenarios  and  conducting  realistic  cyber 
security experiments. 

 
For the physical process  we adopted the IEEE 39-bus New 
England  system  [18],  representing  a  portion  of  the  American 
Electric Power System as of early 1960. The model is run by a 
simulator unit and includes 39 buses, i.e., substations, together 
with  10  generators.  The  daily  load  applied  to  our  system 
derives  from  real  data  [19]  and  is  run  in  parallel  with  the 
power grid model by a separate simulation unit.

We  defined 

separate  XMPP/Jabber  domains:

in  reality,  we  used  each  domain  to  monitor  a  subset  of 
substations.  More

applications 

The disturbance we applied to the grid consisted of a 100ms 
bus  fault  issued  with  the  help  of  Proxy  unit  from  AMICI 
software.  The  fault  replicates  the  effect  of  an  attack  on  the 
power grid which causes circuit breakers to trip, which finally 
leads  to  a  brief  disconnection  of  a specific bus from the grid. 
The experiment setup is depicted in Figure 3. 

B.  Experimental Results 

The  daily  load  applied  to  the  grid  during  this  scenario  is 
similar to a typical daily load curve and is depicted in Figure 4 
(a).  The  XMPP  traffic  measured  in  both  domains  is  highly 
regular  and  mostly  constant,  as  shown  in  Figure  4  (b).  The 
visible  bursts  in  the  same  figure  are  caused  by  concentrator 
mechanisms implemented within HERMIX modules. 

In  Figure  5  we  have  depicted  the  measured  voltages  in  the 
two  power  grid  domains.  As  shown  in  both  sub-figures, 
voltages  are  highly  sensitive  to  the  injected  disturbance.  The 
bust  fault  is  applied  to  bus  1,  belonging  to  the  first  domain, 
and the effect of this action is clearly visible in Figure 5 (a). 

The  injected  disturbance  is  highly  visible  in  the  second 
domain  as  well  (see  Figure  5  (b)).  Here  we  recorded  voltage 
collapse for only one bus (bus 39), which is directly connected 
to bus 1. Nevertheless, the effect is also visible on the voltage 
level of all the other buses. 

This  close  relationship  between  different  power  grid 
substation  voltages  comes  from  the  interconnections  and 
interdependencies  between  different  buses.  Electricity  grids 
require  the  establishment  of  a  certain  balance  between  the 
generated  and  consumed  power.  When 
this  balance  is

I.  INTRODUCTION 

N 

OWADAYS,  Smart  Grid  is  commonly  recognized  as  the 
next  generation  power  grid.  Through  the  pervasive 
adoption  of  modern 
Information  and  Communication 
Technologies (ICT), Smart Grid improves operational benefits 
of  control,  reliability  and  safety,  and  provides  advanced  two-
way 
of 
heterogeneous measurement and sensor-actuator networks. 

communication,  more 

integration 

flexible 

Although the adoption of generic off-the-shelf ICT in Smart 
Grid provisions indisputable advantages and benefits, it raises 
several  issues  concerning  the  reliability  and  security  of 
communications  and  control  systems  –  the  core  infrastructure 
of  Smart  Grid.  The  impact  of  generic  malware  on  the  normal 
functioning of Industrial Control Systems (ICS – part of Smart 
Grid  core)  can  be  devastating  if  we  simply  consider  the 
published attack reports on ICS. Of course, the construction of 
a  comprehensive  list  of  events  and  attacks  is  difficult  to 
achieve  in  the  industrial  setting,  mainly  because  of  non-
disclosure  policies  adopted  by  different 
stakeholders. 
Therefore,  most  reported  events  cannot  be  chronologically 
ordered,  since  the  actual  discovery  date  of  malware  does  not 
coincide with the actual infection time of the system.  

Nevertheless, the year 2010 can be seen as a turning point in 
the  perception  of  security  in  the  industrial  setting.  This  is 
mainly  attributed  to  the  discovery  of  Stuxnet  [1],  the  first 
malware  specifically  designed  to  attack  ICS.  Stuxnet  is  also 
the  world’s  first  (discovered)  malware  capable  to  rewrite  the 
control logic of ICS hardware and to actually hide its presence 

1 

by  exploiting  several  zero-day  vulnerabilities.  Unfortunately, 
the discovery of systems infected with Stuxnet malware is not 
limited  to  the  year  2010  and  other  Stuxnet  targets  have  been 
discovered  at  different  power  plants  and  installations  from 
southern  Iran  in  2012  [2].  The  potential  impact  of  cyber 
attacks in the power sector has been highlighted by the Tempe, 
AZ incident [3] from 2007. In this particular case an improper 
configuration  of  load  shedding  programs  caused  the  opening 
of  141  breakers  and  a  loss  of  significant  load,  which 
subsequently  led  to  a  46  min  power  outage  affecting  almost 
100 000 customers. 

In  this  context,  the  deployment  of  effective  protective 
mechanisms  for  future  infrastructures  such  as  Smart  Grid 
requires  novel 
testing  facilities  with  complex  features 
embodying  the  cyber  and  physical  dimension  of  these  critical 
infrastructures.  To  address  this  issue,  a  substantial  number  of 
approaches have been documented in research publications. As 
such, we find a wide range of testbeds and middleware aimed 
at  facilitating  cyber-physical  security  experimentation  with 
Smart  Grid  and  other  industrial  infrastructures  [7-12].  In  the 
particular case of Smart Grid, a commonly addressed problem 
is  the  actual  architecture  and  protocols  which  will  enable  the 
deployment  of  large-scale  infrastructures  consisting  of  a  wide 
variety  of  devices  and  systems  such  as  Customer  Energy 
Management Systems (CEMS), Distributed Energy Resources 
(DER), Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMI), and so on.

II.  RELATED WORK 

In this section we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art 
for  Smart  Grid  architectures.  AMI  (Advanced  Metering 
Infrastructure)  is  an  important  part  of  the  Smart  Grid  system 
and  several  researches  have  been  carried  out  for  making  it 
scalable and operational during outages.

the 
communication  infrastructure  and  on  the  importance  of 
integration  of  different  communication  protocols  and 
standards.  The  paper  also  documents  the  successful  adoption 
and  application  of  International  Telecommunication  Union 
(ITU) USN/NGN to Smart Grid architecture. 

SeDAX 

(Secure  Data-centric  Application  eXtensible 
platform)  is  the  platform  proposed  by  Young-Jin  Kim,  et  al. 
[8,  9].  SeDAX  uses  Delaunay  Triangulation  (DT)  graphs  to 
provide and information-centric communication in the grid. Its 
architecture  focuses  on  data  availability  and  communication 
resilience  by  using  a  geographic  hash  forwarding  algorithm 
and  a  DT-based  data  replication  scheme.  The  algorithm  is 
evaluated  and  compared  with  other  geometric-based 
alternatives  based  on  route  tables  size,  message  overhead, 
delivery performance and replication cost. 

Zhou,  et  al.  [10]  introduced  a  new  performance  metric  – 
Accumulated Bandwidth Distance Product (ABDP) to evaluate 
communication  architectures  for  AMI  in  Smart  Grid.  The 
metric,  based  on  greedy  algorithm,  was  tested  on  Distributed 
MDMS (Meter Data Management System) architecture, a fully 
distributed  architecture  and  centralized  communication 
architecture. Results proved that distributed architectures have 
more benefits compared to centralized ones. 

Athreya  and  Tague  [11]  proposed  a  self-organizing  mesh 
hierarchy  to  assure  the  operability  of  AMI  during  outages 
based  on  a  distributed  Time  Division  Multiple  Access 
(TDMA).  The  model’s  performance  was  evaluated  using  a 
wireless  TDMA  modeler,  which  proved  to  assure  consistent 
performance during outages. 

Finally, we mention the work of Siaterlis, et al. [12], where 
a generic testbed was proposed to enable security studies with 
cyber-physical  systems.  The  approach  employed  emulation 
testbeds to recreate ICT hardware and software and the AMICI 
simulation  software  to  recreate  the  behavior  of  physical 
processes. 

Compared  to  the  previously  mentioned  approaches,  the 
novelty  of  the  middleware  proposed  in  this  paper  is  that  it 
enables cyber security experiments with an emerging standard, 
i.e.,  Sensei/IoT*,  ensuring  at  the  same  time  an  accurate 

III.  ARCHITECTURE AND DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED 

MIDDLEWARE 

In  this  section  we  provide  a  description  of  the  proposed 
middleware.  We  start  with  an  overview  of  the  emerging 
Sensei/IoT* standard and we continue with a brief presentation 
of  the  two  main  components  of  the  proposed  middleware: 
HERMIX  and  AMICI.  Finally,  we  present  the  proposed 
architecture  which  fuses  several  technologies  and  software  to 
enable  a  wide

range  of 

features 

A.  Sensei/IoT*: from XMPP to Smart Grid 

The  eXtensible  Messaging  and  Presence  Protocol  (XMPP) 
protocol,  developed  in  1999  by  the  Jabber  open-source 
community was intended for near real-time instant messaging, 
presence information, and contact list maintenance.  

The XMPP is an open eXtensible Markup Language (XML) 
protocol which defines the way of XML content streaming. It 
has  been  used  in  many  applications,  most  importantly  the 
Smart Grid in the case of the Internet of Things applications. 

Since  2002  the  XMPP  working  group  established  by 
Internet  Engineering  Task  Force  (IETF)  has  made  efforts  for 
standardization. Initially, four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 
3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923) were created that lead in 2004 to 
a  Proposed  Standard.  In  2011,  first  specifications  were 
replaced  by  RFC  6120  and  RFC  6121,  and  new  ones  were 
added such as RFC 6122. 

Besides  the  mentioned  core  protocols,  the  XMPP  Standard 
Foundation  takes  part  at  the  new  open  XMPP  extensions 
development  also  known  as  XEP  stanzas.  These  are  not 
singular and therefore joint attempts for global, open standards 
among  global  players  are  noticed.  We  mention  here  the 
ISO/IEC/IEEE  P21451-1-4  XMPP  standard,  outlined  in  the 
following sub-sections. 

1)  ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 XMPP Overview 

ISO/IEC/IEEE P21451-1-4 XMPP Interface Standard is also 
known  as  Sensei/IoT*  and  represents  the  first  joint  effort 
amongst  ISO,  IEC,  and  IEEE  to  design  a  Semantic  Web  3.0 
Sensor Standard for Sensor Networks, M2M and IoT. 

The main goal of the Sensei/IoT* standard is to demonstrate 
the assured interoperability, scalability, and security  using the 
XMPP  protocol.  The  scope  of  the  standard  concerning  Smart 
Grid  can  be  summarized  in  the  following  main  points:  (i) 
electric power generation by offering access to data sharing on 
energy usage, primary energy cost or greenhouse gas emission; 
(ii) renewable energy based generation and storage systems by 
offering  access  to  data  concerning  the  primary  energy  and 
stored  energy  availability;  (iii)  transmission  system  on  lines 
and  busses  fault  detection;  (iv)  distribution  system  on 
microgrid  integration  and  substation  controls;  (v)  consumer 
side  on  using  smart  metering,  the  management  of  the  local 
generation and storage capabilities.

Smart  grid  implementation  based  on  Sensei/IoT*  standard

must  answer  a  series  of  key  challenges  concerning: 
effectiveness  of  Internet  usage,  interoperability,  scalability, 
session  persistency,  cyber  vulnerability,  cyber  exposure, 
presence detection, security, etc. Many of these challenges are 
covered  by  the  new  proposed  standard.  We  mention  some  of 
these features: 
-  technology agnostic and protocol independent; 
-  the use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) for data traffic 

encryption built into the protocol; 

-  Meta  Data  Isolation  (MDI)  and  intrusion  protection against 

cyber-attacks; 

-  usage of the Semantic Web 3.0 based on XML metadata for 

providing semantic conversation between devices; 

-  usage  of  a  Service  Broker  as  a  trusted  intermediary  to 
establish a trust relationship between users, applications, and 
devices; 

make  it  a  good  candidate  for  industrial  applications.  The 
platform  uses  XMPP  for  meta-data  exchange  (like  session 
initiation, device managing requests, etc.) and small structured 
data generated by endpoints (e.g., events: a switch changes its 
state,  an  alarm  sensor  detects  movement).  For  high  quantity, 
binary  data,  e.g.,  video  and  audio  streams,  an  out-of-band 
protocol  is  used  depending  on  the  type  of  stream.  At  the 
highest  level  there  is  a  set  of  interconnected  XMPP  servers 
running  over  the  Internet.  The  distribution  of  the  XMPP 
servers  ensures  proper  load  distribution,  interconnection 
between resources managed by different authorities. 

On  the  XMPP  server  level  the  proposed  platform  features 
are  implemented  in  a  server  side  component  which  exposes 
basic  and  common  functionalities  to  be  used  by  the  other 
modules. Those functionalities include: 
-  communication  with the XMPP server and message routing 

-  possibility  to  use  an  Identity  Provider  (IdP)  in  order  to 

between the connected nodes; 

provide Single Sign On (SSO); 

-  support  end-to-end  digital  signing  and  encryption  based  on 

RFC 3923 Efficient XML Interchange (EXI). 
3)  Remarks on Using Sensei/IoT* standard 
Adopting in the existing or newly emerging Smart Grid the 
Sensei/IoT*  standard  can  provide  a  series  of  benefits  such  as 
interoperability, scalability and security. It can be used at any 
level of a Smart Grid allowing the harmonization of protocols 
by enabling operation between new and legacy protocols. 

Many  advantages  are  given  by  the  characteristics  of  the 
XMPP  protocol:  the  technology  and  protocol  independence 
allows decreasing costs and complexity; XMPP can facilitate a 
transition 
to  new  IEC  standards;  XMPP  offers  trusted 
messages  transmission  solutions  and  an  easy  usage  in  case  of 
dynamic  addressing  issues;  it  has  built-in  cyber  security 
protection mechanisms. 

B.  HERMIX Platform 

The  HERMIX  platform 

[4]  developed  by  Vitheia 
consortium  was  designed  to  collect,  store  and  analyze  large 
amount of data coming from a diversity of nodes, ranging from 
sensors to high resolution cameras. 

it 

The platform can be viewed as a set of interconnected nodes 
(physical resources, users, automation scripts, services) with a 
layered  architecture.  Every  node  represents  an  information 
provider  or  a  consumer.  The  logical  management  layer  has  a 
service  oriented  architecture  and 
is  responsible  for 
formatting  and  extracting  the  data,  for  automatic  analysis  and 
processing. This layer also manages the proper authentication, 
authorization  and  access  control  mechanisms  and  assures  the 
interconnection with other systems. The lower communication 
layer uses the event-driven architecture that follows a publish-
subscribe  pattern  for  small  and  structured  data  exchanges 
between  nodes.  The  data  storage  layer  hides  the  used 
underlying  database  system  and  at  the  same  time  it  provides 
storage support for this hybrid communication model. 

The  features  embedded  within  XMPP,  including  federation

-  interconnection with the physical bus; 
-  authorization management; 
-  persistent storage. 

the  physical  devices 

To  assure  the  interoperability  between  different  vendors' 
specific  devices  a  dedicated  module  needs  to  be  created  for 
every  type  of  industrial  bus  (e.g.,  LON,  CAN,  EIB,  Modbus, 
etc.).  The  module  communicates  with  the  specific  bus  and 
transforms 
into  node 
representation.  The  node  is  not  necessarily  hosted  on  the 
resource itself, it acts as a host for a set of resources connected 
to the same bus. The module and the delegate nodes assure the 
protection  of  the  low  capability  resources,  e.g.,  low  power 
sensor  nodes,  from  external  attacks  implementing  proper 
authorization and encryption mechanism. 

information 

A node identified in XMPP world by  a unique JID (Jabber 
ID) is defined by a set of features, status information, received 
commands,  and  generated  events.  Taking  into  account  the 
heterogeneity  of  existing  protocols,  new 
types  can  be 
described,  but  the  main  goal  of  this  resource  model  is  to 
provide  homogeneity  at  the  description  level.  A  node  can  be 
dynamically  created  by  the  Node  Manager  based  on an XML 
description or based on the image saved in the database.  The 
Node  Manager  collects  and  saves  automatically  every 
modification in the registered node data in the Object Archive. 
When  a  saved  data  is  required,  it  is  loaded  into  memory  and 
transformed into its runtime C++ representation. 

The  discovery  mechanism  is  used  to  obtain  information 
about  devices,  their  features  or  events,  using  the  standard 
Service  Discovery  protocol  defined  in  the  XMPP  extension 
XEP-0030  [13].  The  state  is  divided  into  several  parts  to 
assign  different  privilege  levels  to  the  state  variables.  The 
events  are  also  organized  hierarchically  and  different  events 
require  different  privileges  to  subscribe  to  them.  A  user 
subscribing  to  a  collection  node  (an  event  node  tree)  will 
receive  events  generated  by  all  the  descendants  of  the 
collection node. 

The  transport  of  the  binary  data  from  a  source  to  multiple 

destinations is handled by the Controller nodes. The access to 
the  binary  archives  is  also  done  indirectly,  through  the 
controllers. The Controller poses two types of communication 
channels: one for controlling the way data is distributed based 
on  XMPP  protocol;  other  for  actual  large  data  transport.  The 
controller  is  exposed  in  middleware  as  a  delegated  node 
attached to a component.   

The  Object  Manager  also  enforces  permission  policies 
managed by an Authorization Manager. Permission attached to 
an  object  is  represented  as  a  set  of  tuples  (object  id,  list  of 
permission types, a set of bare JIDs, set of groups). When the 
Object Manager needs to authorize access to an object, it will 
request  the  object’s  access  control  list  (if  not already cached) 
from  the  Authorization  Manager.  The  maximum  caching 
interval is imposed by the Authorization Manager and must be 
invalidated  if  it  is  changed.  Separation  between  permission 
validation  and  permission  management assures the third-party 
integration. 

C.  AMICI Platform 

The  Assessment  platform 

for  Multiple  Interdependent 
Critical  Infrastructures  (AMICI)  [5]  provides  software 
simulators  to  recreate  the  physical  dimension  of  critical 
infrastructures  such  as  Smart  Grid.  AMICI  was  developed 
from 
real-time  multi-model 
experimentation  capabilities  supporting  cyber  security  studies 
concerning critical infrastructures. Its architecture, depicted in 
Figure  1,  includes  two  main  components:  a  simulation  unit 
denoted as Sim; and a proxy unit, denoted as Proxy. 

provide

to 

the  difference  between 

The  main  role  of  the  simulation  unit  (Sim)  is  to  run  the 
physical  process  model  in  real-time.  This  is  achieved  by 
coupling  the  model  time  to  the  system  in  such  a  way  to 
minimize 
two.  Models  are 
constructed in Matlab Simulink from where the corresponding 
‘C’  code  is  generated  using  Simulink  Coder.  These  are  then 
integrated  using  an  XML  configuration  file  that  provides  the 
required  flexibility  so  that  researchers  do  not  need  to  modify 
AMICI’s source code. 

the 

From the Sim unit’s point of view each model is seen as a set 
of inputs and outputs. These are mapped to an internal memory 
region  (I/O  MEM)  that  is  read/written  by  other  software 
modules as well. The Sim unit allows an open access to its I/O 
MEM  by  implementing  OS  level  shared  memory  operations. 
This way, AMICI enables interaction with ad-hoc software that 
can  write  specific  model  inputs,  i.e.,  OPEN/CLOSE  a  valve, 
and  can  read  the  status  of  the  model,  i.e.,  measured  voltage. 
Interaction  with  other  Sim  units  is  enabled  by  implementing 
not only RPC (Remote Procedure Call) server-side operations 
but  client-side  calls  as  well.  By  using  only  the  XML 
configuration file, the Sim unit can be configured to read/write 
inputs/outputs  of  models  run  by  remote  Sim  units.  These  are 
mapped  to  the  inputs/outputs  of  the  model  running  locally, 
enabling  complex  interactions  between  models  running  in 
parallel  on  different  machines.  The  Proxy  unit  has  several 
roles within AMICI. First of all, it is able to run remote control 
code,  thus  enabling  the  integration  of  more  complex  control 
hardware emulators. At the same time, it can be used to handle

Modbus  protocol  calls,  transforming  them  to  RPC  calls  and 
finally sending requests to the Sim unit.

As  demonstrated  in  [12],  AMICI  can  be  applied  to  a  wide 
range  of  security  experiments.  Its  software  units  have  been 
tested  with  several  physical  process  models  such  as  oil-fired 
electrical  power  plants,  chemical  processes,  railway  systems, 
and large-scale power grid models. AMICI’s software units are 
available as open source under EUPL license and can be freely

D.  SCYAMIX: Fusing HERMIX With AMICI 

We propose Smart grid CYber security assessment platform 
based on AMIci and hermiX (SCYAMIX), which fuses together 
the  communication  features  provided  by  HERMIX  with  the 
physical  process  simulation  capabilities  brought  by  AMICI. 
SCYAMIX  is  thus  able  to  provide  realistic  communication 
architectures  and  protocols  which  have  been  proved  to  be 
well-adapted  to  large  infrastructures  such  as  the  Smart  Grid 
[4]. At the same time SCYAMIX brings additional capabilities 
to  enable  the  recreation  of  the  physical  dimension,  which 
constitutes a significant component of any industrial system. 

Fundamentally,  from  an  architectural  point  of  view, 
SCYAMIX  provides  capabilities  to  recreate  the  cyber  and 
physical  dimension  of  Smart  Grid.  For  the  cyber  dimension 
SCYAMIX  adopts  HERMIX  to  provide  real  software  and 
protocols  running  on  real  networking  infrastructures.  This 
approach  is  well  established  in  the  field  of  cyber  security, 
since  the  use  of  real  infrastructures  provides  high  fidelity  of 
results  and  in  many  cases  it  can  capture  not  only  whether  a 
system will fail but also how it will fail. In contrast, the use of 
simulation  to  recreate  the  cyber  dimension  of  Smart  Grid 
would provide an effective approach to model normal network 
and  software  conditions,  but  it  would  fail  to  capture  the  way 
computer networks fail. This aspect has been well documented 
and studied by previous work [12, 14, 15, 17]. 

For  the  physical  dimension  SCYAMIX  uses  simulation 
since this provides an efficient, low-cost and safe approach to 
recreate  the  physical  dimension.  Apparently,  this  might  be 
interpreted  as  a  lack  of  realism  and  low  experiment  fidelity, 
however,  the  use  of  software  simulation  for  cyber  security 
experimentation  scenarios  enables  disruptive  experiments  on 
multiple heterogeneous physical processes.

This  is  not  possible  with  production  systems  since  security 
and  resilience  tests  entail  risks  of  potential  side  effects  to 
mission  critical  services  [16].  Furthermore,  today  several 
complex models are freely available and are actually applied in 
different  industries.  For  example, 
the  energy  sector 
simulation  has  become  so  accurate  and  trusted  that  it  is 
commonly  used  to  aid  decision  making  between  transmission 
system operators. 

in 

The  architecture  of  SCYAMIX,  as  a  result  of  fusing 
HERMIX  and  AMICI  is  depicted  in  Figure  2.  The  procedure 
followed  for  this  purpose  exploits  the  features  provided  by 
each of the two software platforms. As such, we implemented 
an  additional  HERMIX  module  to  access  the  shared  memory 
region  created by AMICI’s simulation unit. Model inputs and 
outputs  are  written  and  read  by  the  implemented  module, 
ensuring 
required  communication  between  cyber 
components and the simulated physical processes. 

the 

Devices  exposed  by  simulated  models,  e.g.,  valves  and 
sensors,  are  given  different  JIDs  and  are  accessed  through 
standard  XMPP  stanzas.  Each  device  is  registered  in  the 
HERMIX database (Mongodb) and users (client software) can 
subscribe  to  receive  events.  The  proposed  platform  is  thus 
compatible  with  any  client  software  implementing  an  XMPP 
communication interface according to the standard description. 
This provides a powerful feature and enables the integration of 
heterogeneous  software  which  can  interact  with  simulated 
physical processes in a wide range of scenarios. 

IV.   CASE STUDY 

In  this  section  we  present  a  case  study  showing  the 
applicability  of  the  proposed  middleware.  We  start  by 
presenting a description of the experiment setup and scenario, 
and we continue with the presentation of results. 

A.  Experiment Setup and Scenario 

The  aim  of  this  particular  scenario  is  to  illustrate  the 
interdependence  property  of  physical  processes  and  how  this 
property  can  be  used  to  detect  attacks/faults  by  indirect 
monitoring of process parameters. The experiment also shows 
the  applicability  of  the  proposed  middleware  in  constructing 
realistic  Smart  Grid  scenarios  and  conducting  realistic  cyber 
security experiments. 

 
For the physical process  we adopted the IEEE 39-bus New 
England  system  [18],  representing  a  portion  of  the  American 
Electric Power System as of early 1960. The model is run by a 
simulator unit and includes 39 buses, i.e., substations, together 
with  10  generators.  The  daily  load  applied  to  our  system 
derives  from  real  data  [19]  and  is  run  in  parallel  with  the 
power grid model by a separate simulation unit.

We  defined 

separate  XMPP/Jabber  domains: 
@Grid1.xmpp.ltd  and  @Grid2.xmpp.ltd.  As  it  would  happen 
in  reality,  we  used  each  domain  to  monitor  a  subset  of 
substations.  More

@Grid1.xmpp.ltd  monitored  buses  1  to  18  while  client 
applications in @Grid2.xmpp.ltd monitored buses 19 to 39.

applications 

The disturbance we applied to the grid consisted of a 100ms 
bus  fault  issued  with  the  help  of  Proxy  unit  from  AMICI 
software.  The  fault  replicates  the  effect  of  an  attack  on  the 
power grid which causes circuit breakers to trip, which finally 
leads  to  a  brief  disconnection  of  a specific bus from the grid. 
The experiment setup is depicted in Figure 3. 

B.  Experimental Results 

The  daily  load  applied  to  the  grid  during  this  scenario  is 
similar to a typical daily load curve and is depicted in Figure 4 
(a).  The  XMPP  traffic  measured  in  both  domains  is  highly 
regular  and  mostly  constant,  as  shown  in  Figure  4  (b).  The 
visible  bursts  in  the  same  figure  are  caused  by  concentrator 
mechanisms implemented within HERMIX modules. 

In  Figure  5  we  have  depicted  the  measured  voltages  in  the 
two  power  grid  domains.  As  shown  in  both  sub-figures, 
voltages  are  highly  sensitive  to  the  injected  disturbance.  The 
bust  fault  is  applied  to  bus  1,  belonging  to  the  first  domain, 
and the effect of this action is clearly visible in Figure 5 (a). 

The  injected  disturbance  is  highly  visible  in  the  second 
domain  as  well  (see  Figure  5  (b)).  Here  we  recorded  voltage 
collapse for only one bus (bus 39), which is directly connected 
to bus 1. Nevertheless, the effect is also visible on the voltage 
level of all the other buses. 

This  close  relationship  between  different  power  grid 
substation  voltages  comes  from  the  interconnections  and 
interdependencies  between  different  buses.  Electricity  grids 
require  the  establishment  of  a  certain  balance  between  the 
generated  and  consumed  power.  When 
this  balance  is 

5 

disturbed, there can be serious consequences leading to power 
failure  and  massive  black-outs.  Cyber  attacks  might  have  a 
similar  effect  to  the  one  reported  in  this  study,  since  circuit 
breakers and control mechanisms have the ability to respond to 
commands  issued  remotely.  These  can  lead  to  severe  loss  of 
load which can have a similar effect to the Tempe, AZ incident 
[3] from 2007, as mentioned earlier in this paper.

V.  CONCLUSION 

the 

recent  Sensei/IoT* 

The  middleware  proposed  in  this  paper  provides  a  suite  of 
software  components  and  protocols  to  enable  cyber  security 
experimentation  with 
standard 
proposal. We believe that SCYAMIX advances the state of the 
art  from  several  perspectives:  (i)  the  approach  fuses  a 
XMPP/Jabber-compliant 
software 
simulators  in  order  to  provide  a  complex  set  of  features;  (ii) 
the  middleware  is  highly  scalable,  supporting  scalable  cyber 
and physical dimensions of Smart Grid; and (iii) to the best of 
our  knowledge  SCYAMIX  is  the  first  reported  approach 
providing a Sensei/IoT* compliant implementation combining 
communication  architectures  and  protocols  with  real-time 
software  simulation.  As  future  work  we  intend  to  extend 
SCYAMIX’s  capabilities  and  to  test  its  performances  in
