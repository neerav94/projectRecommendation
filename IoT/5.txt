Abstract.  Most  IoT  platforms  have  been  developed  in  an  effort  to  be 
universally  appied  to  various  services  and  applications.  However,  critical  suc-
cess  factor  of  IoT  is  an  explosion  of  demand  for  services.    Therefore  the  goal 
will  be  achieved  if  the  service  and  the  application  are  reflected  their 
characteristics  for  each  use  case.  Hence  I  presented  an  IoT  platform  for 
healthcare  and  suggested  to  configure  it  with  5  components  in  this  paper. 
Moreover this paper introduced REST APIs as an interface in the platform for 
interoperability with any service and device.

Introduction 

IoT (Internet of Things) is a currently advanced concept of  ICT(information commu-
nication technology), in which all devices and services are collaborating while reduc-
ing human intervention for better human life [1]. The Gartner which is one of market 
research firms expected that IoT has been ranked in the top future promising technol-
ogy. In addition, healthcare service is making the application and development of the 
currently  most  active  IoT  technologies  [2][3].  Mobile  healthcare  service  is  currently 
more  popular  since  healthcare  service  with  computer  was  started  using  ubiquitous 
computing,  but  now,  it  will  be  paid  attention  to  the  next  healthcare  with  wearable 
computer [4][5].  

Current  research  of  IoT  technology,  as  shown  by  the  case,  such  as  Google  Fit,  is 
focused  on  the  open  IoT  platform  and  its  embedded  device  including  sensors  [6].  
However, critical success factor of IoT is an explosion of demand for services. There-
fore it is very important to develop a health service that provides a number of custom-
ized services to users on the open IoT platform [7]. In addition, Medical sensor devic-
es such as glucose meter, and virtual medical sensor such as diabetes meter should be 
provided to users on the same platform.  

Thus  I  propose  the  requirements  for  the  design  of  the  healthcare  model  to  be  of-
fered on the open IoT platform  as the healthcare service are provided to users or pa-
tients.  Chronic diseases - hypertension, diabetes, obesity, etc - are necessary to effec-
tively manage by using healthcare service application [8][9].

For example, a doctor diagnose a patient’ disease exactly after many risk  factors  are 
reviewed  like  gender,  age,  blood  pressure  data,  glucose  data,  cholesterol,  waist  cir-
cumstance,  HbA1c,  etc.  These  intelligent  services  can  be  available  on  the  open  IoT 
platform  for  healthcare  because  that  they  need  to  acquire  and  use  some  risk  factors 
from devices and server. 

2.2  Mobile application and service application 

Mobile  application  provides  a  significant  role  of  the  user  interface  of  the  medical 
sensor  device  as  well  as  information  indication  channel  from  the  server  at  hospital. 
Service  application  provides  information  with  a  doctor  to  analyze  and  diagnose  pa-
tient’s disease as well as providing information with patient to inform his health condi-
tion. However, all medical information is stored in his own mobile device and hospital 
data server specified by the user, but not cloud server. Most users do not want to store 
their  medical  information  in  the  cloud  server  because  of  privacy,  as  shown  as  the 
failed case, Google health service. 

2.3  Platform manager for healthcare and REST API  

It  is  very  important  for  a  platform  to  provide  an  open  API  as  a  unified  manner  to  a 
number of devices and services, regardless of what network they have. However, IoT 
platform uses REST API as an interface as there is no standard for them to access to 
the  platform.  All  devices  and  services  including  mobile  applications  access  to  the 
platform by REST API.  It is a light weight interface of transferring information over 
reliable https network protocol in the IP-enabled network, so that small sized devices 
can  use  the  API  even  if  they  have  some  constraints  like  low  computing  power  and 
small  memory  capacity.  In  addition,  the  platform  has  functions  which  have  service 
discovery,  resource  registration,  access  control,  and  authority  control  by  platform 
manager. 

3   Conclusions 

It means that user can manage his own disease by himself as access to healthcare ser-
vices  in  the  platform  for  healthcare  by  using  medical  device  after  purchasing  it  at  a 
market near his home.  In order to provide the service more effectively, the IoT plat-
form for healthcare is needed. Therefore, the paper presented the design requirements 
for  the  model  to  the  platform.  Several  crucial  components  were  identified  and  re-
searched. 

A further study for virtual medical sensors in the platform and REST API to the de-
vices and services will  be carried out as the next step of research, and extension of 
the  platform  to  provide  how  to  access  to  other  platform  for  interoperability  will  be 
developed.
