Abstract

In this paper we analyze the applicability of Smart TV in Internet of Things (IoT) environments.
First, we list possible roles of TV in IoT-infrastructure and features that a platform should possess
in order to act in the respective role. Then we evaluate existing Smart TV platforms according to
presented requirements to ﬁgure out suitability of various platforms for usage in IoT.

Index Terms: Smart TV, Internet of Things, IoT roles.

I. INTRODUCTION

As stated in [1], the central idea of Internet of Things is the ubiquitous presence of diverse
things, such as smartphones, Radio-Frequency IDentiﬁcation (RFID) tags, sensors, etc., which
are able to communicate with each other to achieve common goals. Internet of Things will
have high impact on several aspects of everyday life, particularly on domestic ﬁeld. Key
requirements for IoT devices include being uniquely addressable, sustainable and enhanceable.
Smart TV device is a television set or a set-top box for the television which provides more
computing and connectivity capabilities than a basic television set. Smart TV devices in the
current state are rather focused on online services, such as on-demand streaming media, over-
the-top content and interactive media. Such TVs have an Ethernet port or a Wi-Fi module and
can run applications, thus they are uniquely addressable and enhanceable. So, it is possible
to use technologies of existing Smart TV platforms in an IoT-environment.

The paper is structured as following. In Section II we consider feasible roles for Smart TVs
and features necessary to fulﬁll the respective role. In Section III we use the list of require-
ments obtained earlier to evaluate applicability of existing platforms in IoT-infrastructure.
Section IV concludes the paper.

II. USE OF SMART TV IN IOT

In this section, we present most expected roles that Smart TV can play in IoT-environment
and requirements for using Smart TV in the according role. We analyzed hardware and
software capabilities of modern Smart TVs and considered their possible roles in abstraction
from the TV itself. We ﬁgured out core requirements for each role. The resulting list acts as
a core for Section III where we compare the applicability of different Smart TV platforms in
IoT.

1) Information storage: is a role in which TV acts as the storage for data from user and
sensors. In [2] authors describe an example in which DVD player holds user’s movies. In
IoT context it is appropriate to use Smart TV in similar, but enhanced way: the user keeps
their collection of movies and music on TV, freeing disk space on the laptop. Another beneﬁt
is the possibility to access this data from any device connected to home network: laptops,
desktops, smartphones, tablets, other TVs. For example, usually user watches their favorite

In this section, we present most expected roles that Smart TV can play in IoT-environment
and requirements for using Smart TV in the according role. We analyzed hardware and
software capabilities of modern Smart TVs and considered their possible roles in abstraction
from the TV itself. We ﬁgured out core requirements for each role. The resulting list acts as
a core for Section III where we compare the applicability of different Smart TV platforms in
IoT.

1) Information storage: is a role in which TV acts as the storage for data from user and
sensors. In [2] authors describe an example in which DVD player holds user’s movies. In
IoT context it is appropriate to use Smart TV in similar, but enhanced way: the user keeps
their collection of movies and music on TV, freeing disk space on the laptop. Another beneﬁt
is the possibility to access this data from any device connected to home network: laptops,
desktops, smartphones, tablets, other TVs. For example, usually user watches their favorite

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

series on the big TV in bedroom, but they dinner in kitchen and wants to watch them on
the small kitchen TV. User just turns on the small TV and plays ﬁles located on the big TV
without the need to do any extra activities like bringing a laptop to kitchen or downloading
series on a USB ﬂash drive.

Furthermore, in IoT-environment there are a lot of other machines with the limited data
storage capacity, particularly sensors. Some applications that process data from sensors need
access to log of that data, for example, time intervals which user spends in bedroom. This
data is used to automatically adjust room temperature when user is in bedroom and save
energy when they are not. Smart TV stores data from all units in same local network, thus
resolving problem of small amounts of memory in these devices.

In IoT-environment there are other devices able to store large amounts of information, such
as laptops and desktops. The main difference between Smart TV and them is uptime. Users
tend to power off their personal computers when they do not use them, especially at night.
If user turns TV off with remote, he deactivates only its screen, without affecting ability to
store and share data.

In order to successfully fulﬁl this role TV requires presence of internal mass storage drive
or ability to connect removable media devices (external hard drive, ﬂash drive, memory card).
2) Visualization device: is a role in which Smart TV acts as the device for displaying
content from external sources. Due to its big screen TV is suitable for the representation
of various graphical information. IoT-environment produces a large amount of displayable
data, such as rooms temperature and lighting levels, contents of the refrigerator, etc. Smart
TV serves as a hub that shows all information about the home in a comfortable way. A
corresponding example of creation of interface to visualize similar data is studied in [3].

The other way to utilize advantages of the TV’s big screen is to use it to visualize content
from local devices with smaller screens, such as smartphones and tablets. For example, user
opens TV menu and browses through devices with available media, such as “User’s laptop”,
”User’s tablet”, etc. Usage of DVD player for same purpose is mentioned in [2]. Furthermore,
user gadgets are not the only ones which can use TV as the external video display. Smart
TV is the easy way for guests of the home to share various video content from their devices,
the only requirement is connection to the same Wi-Fi network. For example, guest presses
“Share to TV” button on smartphone and TV shows dialog, which alerts about incoming ﬁle
and allows to accept or decline it. TV distinguishes user devices from guest by white list and
offers them additional privileges, such as ability to broadcast to TV without conﬁrmation or
other user-deﬁned rules.

To achieve the possibility of playing this role, Smart TV needs a way to access content
from devices in same local network. Another important feature is ability for the external
device to initiate transmission of information to TV.

3) Interaction point: is a role in which Smart TV acts as means for the user to interact
with the IoT infrastructure. In [4] authors suggested to use TV as controller for room lighting,
but there is no obstacles to manage other home switches and controllers, such as temperature
regulators, from TV. For example, user watches TV and gets cold, so they simply use TV’s
remote to enter the home management menu or even gives a voice or gesture command to
adjust the temperature. Smart TV processes this instruction and sends it further to temperature
regulator which in turn heats the room.

Advantage of such system towards modern regulators with individual remote is that control
is uniﬁed, i.e, user does not have to use a certain remote for each controller. They control
any aspect of comfort from any suitable device, including their TV.

I. INTRODUCTION

As stated in [1], the central idea of Internet of Things is the ubiquitous presence of diverse
things, such as smartphones, Radio-Frequency IDentiﬁcation (RFID) tags, sensors, etc., which
are able to communicate with each other to achieve common goals. Internet of Things will
have high impact on several aspects of everyday life, particularly on domestic ﬁeld. Key
requirements for IoT devices include being uniquely addressable, sustainable and enhanceable.
Smart TV device is a television set or a set-top box for the television which provides more

the-top content and interactive media. Such TVs have an Ethernet port or a Wi-Fi module and
can run applications, thus they are uniquely addressable and enhanceable. So, it is possible
to use technologies of existing Smart TV platforms in an IoT-environment.

The paper is structured as following. In Section II we consider feasible roles for Smart TVs
and features necessary to fulﬁll the respective role. In Section III we use the list of require-
ments obtained earlier to evaluate applicability of existing platforms in IoT-infrastructure.
Section IV concludes the paper.

II. USE OF SMART TV IN IOT

In this section, we present most expected roles that Smart TV can play in IoT-environment
and requirements for using Smart TV in the according role. We analyzed hardware and
software capabilities of modern Smart TVs and considered their possible roles in abstraction
from the TV itself. We ﬁgured out core requirements for each role. The resulting list acts as
a core for Section III where we compare the applicability of different Smart TV platforms in
IoT.

is the possibility to access this data from any device connected to home network: laptops,

series on the big TV in bedroom, but they dinner in kitchen and wants to watch them on

regulator which in turn heats the room.

Advantage of such system towards modern regulators with individual remote is that control
is uniﬁed, i.e, user does not have to use a certain remote for each controller. They control
any aspect of comfort from any suitable device, including their TV.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To act in this role, it is necessary for Smart TV to have at least one of various control
options, such as remote, gestures, voice input or other devices and ability to integrate with
other devices.

4) Data processor: role supposes using Smart TV as the external computation unit for
other devices. Due to its large dimensions, it is easy to incorporate a powerful processing
unit into one. Also, as stated in [5], TV is almost always plugged into the power network.
Therefore, with the use of certain applications designed to use this possibility TV can act
as external data processor for other devices to quicken computations and save their battery
charge.

Another way to use Smart TV in this role is to make it manage various routines. For
example, usually the user comes to the home from the work at 18:00 and makes himself
a coffee. TV gathers this information from the coffee machine and is now able to send a
command to start preparing the coffee at 17:55, thus freeing user from the routine.

Requirements to use Smart TV platform in the data processing role are the possibility to

develop applications and sufﬁcient processing capabilities.

5) Data source: is role in which Smart TV acts as source of sensor data. In [6] authors
describe a router that monitors a set of three sensors: water, smoke and temperature and
transfers collected data to home server. User can request current status of any sensor or
check textual database that the server maintains. It is not hard to transfer such functionality
to TV, which also may possess video and sound sensors.

An example of the successful usage of Smart TV in this role is home security system.
Video feed from the camera of the TV is always available in the home network, thus it is
possible to view recorded video stream from any user’s device connected to Internet. Smart
TV processes this stream and recognizes faces. If TV ﬁnds an unidentiﬁed face, there are two
cases. If there are no adult residents in the house, Smart TV triggers the alarm, otherwise, it
sends notiﬁcation to user. They can choose whether recognized face is intruder or guest.

Another possible application of Smart TV is monitoring children. Parents often spend most
of their day at work and have no or little possibilities to check on their children. Kids spend
a lot of time in front of TV watching cartoons or playing, also they do their homework near
the TV. Therefore, TV camera almost always sees them, thus allowing parents to look after
their children.

In order to play this role, TV needs ability to gather sensor data. Sensors which provide

that data can be external or embedded into TV.

III. OVERVIEW OF PLATFORMS AND MIDDLEWARE

Smart TV concept is currently represented by Smart TV platforms and Smart TV mid-
dleware. Platforms are high-level product with API that differs from vendor to vendor.
Middleware is API that provides basic functions to control TV which application developers
use to focus on high-level programming instead of low-level. So, middleware acts as layer
between hardware and software. All platforms base on some middleware, which can be
proprietary or not. In this section we analyze possibilities of using existing Smart TV platforms
and middleware in various roles, given in the previous Section. Table I contains overall
information on our opinion about applicability of these platforms in each role. Good means
that it is possible for platform to act in all use cases we provided for according role.
Average means that platform has strictly limited use in particular role, i.e., is not suitable for
some use cases. Bad means that platform has no or little possibility of acting in this role,
i.e., is not usable in any given use cases.

A. Smart TV platforms

1) Samsung Smart TV: In 2007, Samsung introduced the Internet TV, enabling viewer to
receive information from the Internet while at the same time watching conventional television
programming. This development was later renamed to ”Smart LED TV” and then to ”Samsung
Smart TV”, which additionally supports downloading and installing applications.

Samsung Smart TV supports external hard drives and usb-ﬂash [7] that reveal role of
Information storage, such as digital video recording and playing different media ﬁles. Internal
memory is used as a buffer for streaming content and for installed application ﬁles.

Samsung Smart TV supports DLNA protocol that enables displaying different content
simultaneously on laptop, smartphone and tablet and streaming media from devices to TV.
This feature allows to play Visualization device role.

Samsung’s platform supports Smart Interaction features required for Interaction role that
provides launch and use of applications through Motion Control and Voice Control [8]. Motion
Control allows to use hands to control TV functions by swiping to navigate and grabbing to
select movies, games and applications. Voice Control allows navigate menus and launch any
applications through voice commands.

Samsung’s platform only supports web-based apps (JS, CSS, HTML, FLASH) [9]. For
developing application Samsung offers Smart TV SDK, which is available for all platforms:
Windows, Linux, Mac. This reveals role of Data processing. Samsung Smart TV supports
push-notiﬁcations [10]. It allows to show popup-message on screen with ability to launch
application.

To represent the Samsung Smart TV as the Source of data, latest TV models besides sensors
for voice control have internal cameras, that provide Face Recognition [8] for instant access
to personal apps and Skype’s contact list.

2) Panasonic Viera Connect: Viera Cast is Smart TV platform by Panasonic that makes
it possible to stream multimedia content from the Internet directly into TVs. Viera Cast was
announced on Consumer Electronics Show in January 2008, but in 2011 the platform has
been updated. Now it is called Viera Connect and allows to develop and install third-party
applications.

Devices from Panasonic support connection of USB external hard drives [11] to store media
ﬁles: music, video, photos and TV recordings, thus uncovering role of Information storage
Viera Connect has a possibility to connect DLNA-compatible AV equipment to home

network [12] that required for the Visualization role.

Interaction role is present with following features: ability to connect keyboard that does
not require any drivers and Viera Remote application that offers usage of an iOS or Android
device as a remote, which allows you to turn smartphone or tablet into a remote control.

Abstract

In this paper we analyze the applicability of Smart TV in Internet of Things (IoT) environments.
First, we list possible roles of TV in IoT-infrastructure and features that a platform should possess
in order to act in the respective role. Then we evaluate existing Smart TV platforms according to
presented requirements to ﬁgure out suitability of various platforms for usage in IoT.

Index Terms: Smart TV, Internet of Things, IoT roles.

I. INTRODUCTION

As stated in [1], the central idea of Internet of Things is the ubiquitous presence of diverse
things, such as smartphones, Radio-Frequency IDentiﬁcation (RFID) tags, sensors, etc., which
are able to communicate with each other to achieve common goals. Internet of Things will
have high impact on several aspects of everyday life, particularly on domestic ﬁeld. Key
requirements for IoT devices include being uniquely addressable, sustainable and enhanceable.
Smart TV device is a television set or a set-top box for the television which provides more
computing and connectivity capabilities than a basic television set. Smart TV devices in the
current state are rather focused on online services, such as on-demand streaming media, over-
the-top content and interactive media. Such TVs have an Ethernet port or a Wi-Fi module and
can run applications, thus they are uniquely addressable and enhanceable. So, it is possible
to use technologies of existing Smart TV platforms in an IoT-environment.

The paper is structured as following. In Section II we consider feasible roles for Smart TVs
and features necessary to fulﬁll the respective role. In Section III we use the list of require-
ments obtained earlier to evaluate applicability of existing platforms in IoT-infrastructure.
Section IV concludes the paper.

II. USE OF SMART TV IN IOT

In this section, we present most expected roles that Smart TV can play in IoT-environment
and requirements for using Smart TV in the according role. We analyzed hardware and
software capabilities of modern Smart TVs and considered their possible roles in abstraction
from the TV itself. We ﬁgured out core requirements for each role. The resulting list acts as
a core for Section III where we compare the applicability of different Smart TV platforms in
IoT.

1) Information storage: is a role in which TV acts as the storage for data from user and
sensors. In [2] authors describe an example in which DVD player holds user’s movies. In
IoT context it is appropriate to use Smart TV in similar, but enhanced way: the user keeps
their collection of movies and music on TV, freeing disk space on the laptop. Another beneﬁt
is the possibility to access this data from any device connected to home network: laptops,
desktops, smartphones, tablets, other TVs. For example, usually user watches their favorite

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

series on the big TV in bedroom, but they dinner in kitchen and wants to watch them on
the small kitchen TV. User just turns on the small TV and plays ﬁles located on the big TV
without the need to do any extra activities like bringing a laptop to kitchen or downloading
series on a USB ﬂash drive.

Furthermore, in IoT-environment there are a lot of other machines with the limited data
storage capacity, particularly sensors. Some applications that process data from sensors need
access to log of that data, for example, time intervals which user spends in bedroom. This
data is used to automatically adjust room temperature when user is in bedroom and save
energy when they are not. Smart TV stores data from all units in same local network, thus
resolving problem of small amounts of memory in these devices.

In IoT-environment there are other devices able to store large amounts of information, such
as laptops and desktops. The main difference between Smart TV and them is uptime. Users
tend to power off their personal computers when they do not use them, especially at night.
If user turns TV off with remote, he deactivates only its screen, without affecting ability to
store and share data.

In order to successfully fulﬁl this role TV requires presence of internal mass storage drive
or ability to connect removable media devices (external hard drive, ﬂash drive, memory card).
2) Visualization device: is a role in which Smart TV acts as the device for displaying
content from external sources. Due to its big screen TV is suitable for the representation
of various graphical information. IoT-environment produces a large amount of displayable
data, such as rooms temperature and lighting levels, contents of the refrigerator, etc. Smart
TV serves as a hub that shows all information about the home in a comfortable way. A
corresponding example of creation of interface to visualize similar data is studied in [3].

The other way to utilize advantages of the TV’s big screen is to use it to visualize content
from local devices with smaller screens, such as smartphones and tablets. For example, user
opens TV menu and browses through devices with available media, such as “User’s laptop”,
”User’s tablet”, etc. Usage of DVD player for same purpose is mentioned in [2]. Furthermore,
user gadgets are not the only ones which can use TV as the external video display. Smart
TV is the easy way for guests of the home to share various video content from their devices,
the only requirement is connection to the same Wi-Fi network. For example, guest presses
“Share to TV” button on smartphone and TV shows dialog, which alerts about incoming ﬁle
and allows to accept or decline it. TV distinguishes user devices from guest by white list and
offers them additional privileges, such as ability to broadcast to TV without conﬁrmation or
other user-deﬁned rules.

To achieve the possibility of playing this role, Smart TV needs a way to access content
from devices in same local network. Another important feature is ability for the external
device to initiate transmission of information to TV.

3) Interaction point: is a role in which Smart TV acts as means for the user to interact
with the IoT infrastructure. In [4] authors suggested to use TV as controller for room lighting,
but there is no obstacles to manage other home switches and controllers, such as temperature
regulators, from TV. For example, user watches TV and gets cold, so they simply use TV’s
remote to enter the home management menu or even gives a voice or gesture command to
adjust the temperature. Smart TV processes this instruction and sends it further to temperature
regulator which in turn heats the room.

Advantage of such system towards modern regulators with individual remote is that control
is uniﬁed, i.e, user does not have to use a certain remote for each controller. They control
any aspect of comfort from any suitable device, including their TV.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

164

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

__________________________________________PROCEEDING OF THE 13TH CONFERENCE OF FRUCT ASSOCIATION

To act in this role, it is necessary for Smart TV to have at least one of various control
options, such as remote, gestures, voice input or other devices and ability to integrate with
other devices.

4) Data processor: role supposes using Smart TV as the external computation unit for
other devices. Due to its large dimensions, it is easy to incorporate a powerful processing
unit into one. Also, as stated in [5], TV is almost always plugged into the power network.
Therefore, with the use of certain applications designed to use this possibility TV can act
as external data processor for other devices to quicken computations and save their battery
charge.

Another way to use Smart TV in this role is to make it manage various routines. For
example, usually the user comes to the home from the work at 18:00 and makes himself
a coffee. TV gathers this information from the coffee machine and is now able to send a
command to start preparing the coffee at 17:55, thus freeing user from the routine.

Requirements to use Smart TV platform in the data processing role are the possibility to

develop applications and sufﬁcient processing capabilities.

5) Data source: is role in which Smart TV acts as source of sensor data. In [6] authors
describe a router that monitors a set of three sensors: water, smoke and temperature and
transfers collected data to home server. User can request current status of any sensor or
check textual database that the server maintains. It is not hard to transfer such functionality
to TV, which also may possess video and sound sensors.

An example of the successful usage of Smart TV in this role is home security system.
Video feed from the camera of the TV is always available in the home network, thus it is
possible to view recorded video stream from any user’s device connected to Internet. Smart
TV processes this stream and recognizes faces. If TV ﬁnds an unidentiﬁed face, there are two
cases. If there are no adult residents in the house, Smart TV triggers the alarm, otherwise, it
sends notiﬁcation to user. They can choose whether recognized face is intruder or guest.

Another possible application of Smart TV is monitoring children. Parents often spend most
of their day at work and have no or little possibilities to check on their children. Kids spend
a lot of time in front of TV watching cartoons or playing, also they do their homework near
the TV. Therefore, TV camera almost always sees them, thus allowing parents to look after
their children.

In order to play this role, TV needs ability to gather sensor data. Sensors which provide

that data can be external or embedded into TV.

III. OVERVIEW OF PLATFORMS AND MIDDLEWARE

Smart TV concept is currently represented by Smart TV platforms and Smart TV mid-
dleware. Platforms are high-level product with API that differs from vendor to vendor.
Middleware is API that provides basic functions to control TV which application developers
use to focus on high-level programming instead of low-level. So, middleware acts as layer
between hardware and software. All platforms base on some middleware, which can be
proprietary or not. In this section we analyze possibilities of using existing Smart TV platforms
and middleware in various roles, given in the previous Section. Table I contains overall
information on our opinion about applicability of these platforms in each role. Good means
that it is possible for platform to act in all use cases we provided for according role.
Average means that platform has strictly limited use in particular role, i.e., is not suitable for
some use cases. Bad means that platform has no or little possibility of acting in this role,
i.e., is not usable in any given use cases.

A. Smart TV platforms

1) Samsung Smart TV: In 2007, Samsung introduced the Internet TV, enabling viewer to
receive information from the Internet while at the same time watching conventional television
programming. This development was later renamed to ”Smart LED TV” and then to ”Samsung
Smart TV”, which additionally supports downloading and installing applications.

Samsung Smart TV supports external hard drives and usb-ﬂash [7] that reveal role of
Information storage, such as digital video recording and playing different media ﬁles. Internal
memory is used as a buffer for streaming content and for installed application ﬁles.

Samsung Smart TV supports DLNA protocol that enables displaying different content
simultaneously on laptop, smartphone and tablet and streaming media from devices to TV.
This feature allows to play Visualization device role.

Samsung’s platform supports Smart Interaction features required for Interaction role that
provides launch and use of applications through Motion Control and Voice Control [8]. Motion
Control allows to use hands to control TV functions by swiping to navigate and grabbing to
select movies, games and applications. Voice Control allows navigate menus and launch any
applications through voice commands.

Samsung’s platform only supports web-based apps (JS, CSS, HTML, FLASH) [9]. For
developing application Samsung offers Smart TV SDK, which is available for all platforms:
Windows, Linux, Mac. This reveals role of Data processing. Samsung Smart TV supports
push-notiﬁcations [10]. It allows to show popup-message on screen with ability to launch
application.

To represent the Samsung Smart TV as the Source of data, latest TV models besides sensors
for voice control have internal cameras, that provide Face Recognition [8] for instant access
to personal apps and Skype’s contact list.

2) Panasonic Viera Connect: Viera Cast is Smart TV platform by Panasonic that makes
it possible to stream multimedia content from the Internet directly into TVs. Viera Cast was
announced on Consumer Electronics Show in January 2008, but in 2011 the platform has
been updated. Now it is called Viera Connect and allows to develop and install third-party
applications.

Devices from Panasonic support connection of USB external hard drives [11] to store media
ﬁles: music, video, photos and TV recordings, thus uncovering role of Information storage
Viera Connect has a possibility to connect DLNA-compatible AV equipment to home

network [12] that required for the Visualization role.

Interaction role is present with following features: ability to connect keyboard that does
not require any drivers and Viera Remote application that offers usage of an iOS or Android
device as a remote, which allows you to turn smartphone or tablet into a remote control.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

166

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

__________________________________________PROCEEDING OF THE 13TH CONFERENCE OF FRUCT ASSOCIATION

Panasonic’s platform supports HTML, Java Script (AJAX) for developing application with

VIERA Connect SDK [13]. This reveals role of Data processing.

Viera Connect devices have no internal sensors, but support external USB cameras [14]

that represent role of Source of data.

3) LG Smart TV: LG Electronics introduced their ﬁrst Internet TV in 2007, branded as
“NetCast Entertainment Access” devices. In 2011 they renamed it to ”LG Smart TV” and
added more interactive TV features that enable user to receive information from the Internet
while watching conventional TV programming at the same time.

Role of Information storage presented by support for connecting external USB drives to

store and play media contents.

Platform has the Smart Share feature [15] required for Visualization role. This feature
provides synchronization of devices in a single Smart TV system - from Blu-Ray player,
Hi-Fi systems, smartphones and laptops.

LG Smart TV offers the Magic Motion Remote Control (MMRC) that operates like a
computer mouse. With MMRC TV devices can track the movement of remote control in
space. This feature is required for Interaction role.

Role of Data processing represented by support for popular development environment:
HTML 5.0, Java Script, ActionScript 3.0 (Flash) and gaming platforms (Unity 3D and Mar-
malade).

TVs on this platform do not have internal cameras and microphone but these devices can

be connected separately. This discloses role of Source of data.

B. Smart TV middleware

1) Microsoft Mediaroom: Microsoft Mediaroom is proprietary middleware that many pay-
TV providers use to deliver their services to end users [16]. Hardware and its features differ
between providers and they do not post speciﬁcations of their set-top boxes.

Microsoft Mediaroom has no support for USB, thus no support for external USB drives, but
YouView Humax DTR-T1000 [17] has a 500GB hard drive, allowing to use it in Information
storage role. This middleware has no way to show content from any source except service
provider, making it not suitable for Visualization role. Possibility to connect to X-Box and
thus to Kinect makes Mediaroom useful in Interaction with user and Source of data roles.
Mediaroom Presentation Framework (MPF) allows creation of rich and functional applications,
but only service providers are able to give a license to develop and publish an application to
provider-speciﬁc store. It hardens using Mediaroom in Data processing role.

Microsoft Mediaroom was created only to deliver pay-TV services and is not suitable for

usage in IoT-infrastructure.

2) Google TV: Google TV is currently available only through Sony NSZ-GS7 Internet
Player [18], [19], which comes in single modiﬁcation. It has 8GB of internal memory and
support for external USB ﬂash and hard drives, enabling this middleware in Information
storage role. Presence of DLNA allows usage of device in Visualization role. Various con-
venient ways to control TV, such as phone or tablet and universal remote with touchpad and
QWERTY keyboard make Google TV suitable for Interaction with user role. Data processing
role requires applications and Google Play, available on TV, has tons of them. Also, Google
TV operates on Android 3.0 operating system, which is able to run applications in background.
Fulﬁllment the role of Source of data is made possible by ability to connect external USB
video camera.

venient ways to control TV, such as phone or tablet and universal remote with touchpad and
QWERTY keyboard make Google TV suitable for Interaction with user role. Data processing
role requires applications and Google Play, available on TV, has tons of them. Also, Google
TV operates on Android 3.0 operating system, which is able to run applications in background.
Fulﬁllment the role of Source of data is made possible by ability to connect external USB
video camera.

Overall Google TV has biggest amount of premises to be used in IoT-environment. Its
main advantage towards previous platforms is its operating system. None of other platforms
are able to run applications in background, while Google’s Android OS can. Such ability is
necessary to show notiﬁcations and process consistent ﬂow of data which sensors and other
devices transfer to TV. It makes Google TV Good in Data processing role, and lack of such
functionality makes other platforms Average.

IV. CONCLUSION

We surveyed most expected roles Smart TV can play in IoT-environments and anticipate
that Smart TV has great potential in world of IoT, furthermore, Google TV is already highly
suitable for incorporating in IoT-infrastructure. Samsung, Panasonic and LG platforms are
less suitable due to their strictly limited API, which does not allow to run applications in
background, thus reducing capabilities of using these platforms in very important role of
Data processing. Adding functionality of running background applications will enable usage
of these platforms in this role.

Smart TV vendors currently dedicate a lot of resources for interaction features. Each Smart
TV platform has its own interaction technology. It is possible to adapt these technologies for
usage in other domains of Internet of Things, such as transportation or healthcare.
