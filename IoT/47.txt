attached  to  the  products  and  things,  in 
order to store data and meta-data about the 
products.  The  sensors  will  read  or  modify 
the  data  stored  in  RFID  labels  attached  to 
the things. In order to provide authentication 
and  data  integrity,  the  solution  will  have  an 
authentication  procedure 
requires 
minimum  of  processing  and  power 
consumption, but in the same time it will be 
strong enough to avoid security pitfalls. 
The  minimum  authentication  model  will 
require a mechanism similar with CRYPTO1 
from  Mifare  1K/4K  proximity  cards  and  a 
higher secure model would be inspired from 
Sony  FeliCa  cards  and  VISA/Mastercard

Abstract:  In  first  section  the  IoT  –  Internet  of  Things  ecosystem  is  presented  with  features  and 
particularities. Second section presents the technical terminology and how inter-domain technologies 
such  as:  Internet/Semantic  and  Middleware,  RFID/NFC  and  Smart  Objects-embedded  devices  are 
linked together. The paper shows an implementation of the authentication procedure with a proximity 
tag/card  implemented  in  Java  SE,  in  the  third  section.  The  conclusions  are  presented  in  the  fourth 
section  and  they  present  the  opportunity  to  develop  a  proof  of  concept  project,  which  may  have 
multiple implementations.

1      IoT  (Internet  of  Things)  Ecosystem 
Intro 
 
The  concept  of  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  is 
related  to  uniquely  identifiable  objects  and 
their  virtual  representations  in  a  structure 
similar  with  the  Internet.  This  new  concept 
is  an 
to  realize  a 
quantitative  analysis  of  all  the  things  that 
surround  us.  A  prerequisite  needed  for  the 
Internet  of  Things  is  the  radio-frequency 
identification  (RFID). 
If  all  objects  and 
people  in  real  life  were  equipped  with 
identifiers  and  smart-tags,  they  could  be 
managed and inventoried by computers. [1] 
People  have  limited  time,  attention  and 
accuracy, so that they are not  very  good at 
capturing  and  storing  information  about  all 
the  things  from  the  real  world  (even  if  we 
include  2D  barcodes  used  for  Automatic 
Data 
An 

alternative  view  on  IoT,  from  the  Semantic 
instead  on 
Web  perspective, 
making  all 
the 
existing naming protocols, such as URI (this 
refer  to  other  things  than  those  electronic, 
smart,  or  RFID-enabled).  The  objects 
themselves can be referred for the moment 
by  other  agents,  for  example  by  powerful 
centralized  servers  acting  for  their  human 
owners, without conversion. 
In  [2]  is  considered  that  the  Internet  of 
Things  is  the  network  of  physical  objects 
that  contain 
to 
communicate  and  sense  or  to  interact  with 
their

environment.

environments,  that  allows  the  development 
of  open  source  applications  for  the  Internet 
of Things. 
 
2. IoT Technical Details 
 
The  IoT  is  composed  of  many  sensors, 
application  platforms,  user  platforms,  and 
so  on,  creating  a  community  ecosystem.  A 
sensor  is  a  component  that  collects  and 
delivers 
in  a 
specified  area.  By  building  a  shared 
common  platform  such  as  IoT  will  create  a 
richer  ecosystem  for  all  the  people,  by 
enabling  the  development  of 
innovative 

information  about 

such 

as 

things 

systems to focus on the value-added of the 
human  physical  touch  points  of  connected 
objects and the services that manage these 
objects [3]. 
The Internet of Things means to connect in 
real-time  people  and  objects  from  the  real 
physical  world  together  in  a  network  of 
sensing,  reasoning,  and  action.  The  IoT 
connects  people  and  things  together  with 
software products and applications. 
A  Smart  Object  contains  IoT  data  and 
information,  also  metadata  and  software 
agent  code  resources,  such  as  application 
software  event  handler.  Samples  of  Smart 
Objects  are  embedded  devices  such  as 
Rasberry  Pi,  Arduino,  BeagleBone/Ninja 
Blocks.  The  data  model 
for  broad 
interoperability  is  represented  by  the  Smart 
Object API. 
The  Smart  Object  API  is  represented  by  a 
Semantic Web application for the Internet of 
Things that provides linked-data interactions

between  application  software  agents  and 
IoT  endpoints,  sensors  and  user  devices, 
which are pluggable in real-time [3]. 
The  IoT  vendor  silos  provide  high  level 
cooked  APIs  from  cloud  services  of  Smart 
Object  API,  enabling  integration  of  IoT 
resources  from  top  to  bottom  of  the  stack. 
The  IoT  of  today  means  no  interoperability 
and  existence  of  many  vertical  and 
horizontal silos. 
The Smart Object API supports the concept 
of  a Smart  Gateway,  which is  working  as  a 
Smart  Object  intermediate  for  devices  on 
the  network,  adding  semantic  descriptors 
and  offering  a  service  interface  for  the 
Internet.

Sensors

programmed  for  each  service  they  need  to 
interact with.  
IoT  applications  consist  of  sensors  and 
actuators  end  points,  user  device  end 
points,  and  application  software 
that

of  a  directed  graph.  We  can  also  build  a 
graph  of  resources  consisting  of  Smart 
Objects  connected  to  services  and  other 
Smart  Objects,  based  on  the  related  IoT 
ontologies, and the Smart Object API. [3] 
The  interoperability  and  interdependence 
between  multiple  devices  is  becoming  a 
common  characteristic  because  people  are 
trying  to  build  their  own  Internet  of  Things 
by  getting  all  their  smart  devices  to  be 
connected  in  the  cloud.  The  IoT  needs  a 
standard  to  interact  with  other  devices  and 
this  standard  must  enable  software  for 
easier interaction.  
The  actual  Internet  of  Things  consists  of 
many  different  sensor  networks  and 
protocols,  connected 
to  special  cloud 
services  and  offering  access  through  smart 
mobile  devices  and  browser  applications.  It 
is  unusual  for  these  separate  silos  to 
cooperate  or  interact  one  with  each  other.

strong enough to avoid security pitfalls. 
The  minimum  authentication  model  will

In  2020  there  is  estimation  that  will  be  50 
billion IoT devices in the market. At least all 
the  consumers  of  “Java  enabled”  and 
Embedded Linux smart objects will be in the 
main target group for open source solutions. 
The  smart  objects  are  processing  the  data 
collected  from  sensors  and  for  instance, 
from  RFID  tags/cards.  The  authentication 
process  is  an  important  approach  taking 
into  account  NFC  and  RFID  domains 
expansion.  
Besides the authentication process of RFID 
tags/cards  by  the  IoT  sensors,  the  paper 
represents 
for 
developing  a  proof  of  concept  that  will 
demonstrate  how  the RFID/NFC  tags/cards 
are  written  with  meta-data  information,  and 
then  periodically  tags/cards  area  read  by 
RFID/NFC  reader/writer  devices  (sensors), 
in  order  to  do  the  things  tracking.  The 
obtained 
is  securely  and 
collaborative aggregated  into a unified data 
model  and  processed  using  distributed 
computing methodologies over “big data”.

Abstract:  In  first  section  the  IoT  –  Internet  of  Things  ecosystem  is  presented  with  features  and 
particularities. Second section presents the technical terminology and how inter-domain technologies 
such  as:  Internet/Semantic  and  Middleware,  RFID/NFC  and  Smart  Objects-embedded  devices  are 
linked together. The paper shows an implementation of the authentication procedure with a proximity 
tag/card  implemented  in  Java  SE,  in  the  third  section.  The  conclusions  are  presented  in  the  fourth 
section  and  they  present  the  opportunity  to  develop  a  proof  of  concept  project,  which  may  have 
multiple implementations.

1      IoT  (Internet  of  Things)  Ecosystem 
Intro 
 
The  concept  of  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  is 
related  to  uniquely  identifiable  objects  and 
their  virtual  representations  in  a  structure 
similar  with  the  Internet.  This  new  concept 
is  an 
to  realize  a 
quantitative  analysis  of  all  the  things  that 
surround  us.  A  prerequisite  needed  for  the 
Internet  of  Things  is  the  radio-frequency 
identification  (RFID). 
If  all  objects  and 
people  in  real  life  were  equipped  with 
identifiers  and  smart-tags,  they  could  be 
managed and inventoried by computers. [1] 
People  have  limited  time,  attention  and 
accuracy, so that they are not  very  good at 
capturing  and  storing  information  about  all 
the  things  from  the  real  world  (even  if  we 
include  2D  barcodes  used  for  Automatic 
Data 
An 

alternative  view  on  IoT,  from  the  Semantic 
instead  on 
Web  perspective, 
making  all 
the 
existing naming protocols, such as URI (this 
refer  to  other  things  than  those  electronic, 
smart,  or  RFID-enabled).  The  objects 
themselves can be referred for the moment 
by  other  agents,  for  example  by  powerful 
centralized  servers  acting  for  their  human 
owners, without conversion. 
In  [2]  is  considered  that  the  Internet  of 
Things  is  the  network  of  physical  objects 
that  contain 
to 
communicate  and  sense  or  to  interact  with 
their 
the  external 
environment.

environments,  that  allows  the  development 
of  open  source  applications  for  the  Internet 
of Things. 
 
2. IoT Technical Details 
 
The  IoT  is  composed  of  many  sensors, 
application  platforms,  user  platforms,  and 
so  on,  creating  a  community  ecosystem.  A 
sensor  is  a  component  that  collects  and 
delivers 
in  a 
specified  area.  By  building  a  shared 
common  platform  such  as  IoT  will  create  a 
richer  ecosystem  for  all  the  people,  by 
enabling  the  development  of 
innovative 

information  about 

such 

as 

things 

systems to focus on the value-added of the 
human  physical  touch  points  of  connected 
objects and the services that manage these 
objects [3]. 
The Internet of Things means to connect in 
real-time  people  and  objects  from  the  real 
physical  world  together  in  a  network  of 
sensing,  reasoning,  and  action.  The  IoT 
connects  people  and  things  together  with 
software products and applications. 
A  Smart  Object  contains  IoT  data  and 
information,  also  metadata  and  software 
agent  code  resources,  such  as  application 
software  event  handler.  Samples  of  Smart 
Objects  are  embedded  devices  such  as 
Rasberry  Pi,  Arduino,  BeagleBone/Ninja 
Blocks.  The  data  model 
for  broad 
interoperability  is  represented  by  the  Smart 
Object API. 
The  Smart  Object  API  is  represented  by  a 
Semantic Web application for the Internet of 
Things that provides linked-data interactions

between  application  software  agents  and 
IoT  endpoints,  sensors  and  user  devices, 
which are pluggable in real-time [3]. 
The  IoT  vendor  silos  provide  high  level 
cooked  APIs  from  cloud  services  of  Smart 
Object  API,  enabling  integration  of  IoT 
resources  from  top  to  bottom  of  the  stack. 
The  IoT  of  today  means  no  interoperability 
and  existence  of  many  vertical  and 
horizontal silos. 
The Smart Object API supports the concept 
of  a Smart  Gateway,  which is  working  as  a 
Smart  Object  intermediate  for  devices  on 
the  network,  adding  semantic  descriptors 
and  offering  a  service  interface  for  the 
Internet. 
device 
Sensors

programmed  for  each  service  they  need  to 
interact with.  
IoT  applications  consist  of  sensors  and 
actuators  end  points,  user  device  end 
points,  and  application  software 
that

of  a  directed  graph.  We  can  also  build  a 
graph  of  resources  consisting  of  Smart 
Objects  connected  to  services  and  other 
Smart  Objects,  based  on  the  related  IoT 
ontologies, and the Smart Object API. [3] 
The  interoperability  and  interdependence 
between  multiple  devices  is  becoming  a 
common  characteristic  because  people  are 
trying  to  build  their  own  Internet  of  Things 
by  getting  all  their  smart  devices  to  be 
connected  in  the  cloud.  The  IoT  needs  a 
standard  to  interact  with  other  devices  and 
this  standard  must  enable  software  for 
easier interaction.  
The  actual  Internet  of  Things  consists  of 
many  different  sensor  networks  and 
protocols,  connected 
to  special  cloud 
services  and  offering  access  through  smart 
mobile  devices  and  browser  applications.  It 
is  unusual  for  these  separate  silos  to 
cooperate  or  interact  one  with  each  other.

order to store data and meta-data about the

the  data  stored  in  RFID  labels  attached  to 
the things. In order to provide authentication 
and  data  integrity,  the  solution  will  have  an 
authentication  procedure 
requires 
minimum  of  processing  and  power 
consumption, but in the same time it will be 
strong enough to avoid security pitfalls. 
The  minimum  authentication  model  will 
require a mechanism similar with CRYPTO1 
from  Mifare  1K/4K  proximity  cards  and  a

The  proof  of  concept  project  results  may 
include:  
1.  The 
REST/Web-services/communications 
protocols and M2M data-structures;  
2. The beta version of the software libraries 
that  implement  products/services  tracking 
and clustering:  
 

the  data 

sensor control using devices SDKs; the 
reading/writing  of 
formats 
from/in 
vicinity/proximity 
RFID 
tags/cards  and  optionally,  reading  2D 
barcodes of the products/services;  
“big  data”  processing  and  semantic 
parsing,  via  distributed  computing 
model  and 
implementation,  using 
embedded  devices/boards  (Internet  of 
Things ‘smart objects’, e.g. Raspberry-
PI  board) 
for  cloud  micro-instance 
deployment and standard PCs/laptops;  
secure  communications  from  sensors 
to 
IoT  Service 
Gateways.

During  the  development  of  the  proof  of 
concept  project,  we  estimate  that  we  will 
create 
Java 
implementation  for  Smart  Object  API,  to 
enhance 
and 
communications 
for  REST 
Interface/Web-services,  and  improvement 
of  M2M/IoT  data  models  plus  value  added 
services  for  existing  and  new  IoT  deployed 
“silos”-es.
