I. INTRODUCTION 

Agriculture sector is the broadest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall economic growth of India. 
Today, India ranks second worldwide in Agriculture production. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry and fisheries for 
13.7%  of  the  GDP  (Gross  Domestic  Product)  in  2013.  India  is  the  world’s  largest  democracy  with  1.2  billion  populations. 
Despite with its current position, the sector needs to look forward with objective of innovating new things and to stay in the

wastage combating hunger and improving food security. It is difficult to know that how much food is lost and wasted in India 
today due to lack of proper infrastructure. However, a 2011 report by a UN body, gives information about wastage in fruits and 
vegetables as high as 45% of produce (post-harvest to distribution) in India. 

In India, major component of the agro supply chain system is either in the public sector, or strongly associated to it. The 
Indian government decides produce after analysing the costs of growing a particular crop at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs),

updated services to their clients in turn. Cloud consists of physical machines in the data centres of cloud providers. The cloud 
provides services like Platform as a Service, Software as a Service or Infrastructure as a Service. Cloud acts as the single point 
of access for serving all customers and internet is the medium for accessing these services.   

Looking at the potential benefits of cloud computing we can list out its role in agricultural development in India. Using the 
applications  of  cloud  the  farmers  have  nothing  to  worry  about  hardware  and  software  investment  and  also  the  technical 
knowledge required to learn them. The farmers will send the request for the specific cloud service using a user friendly device, 
and the cloud service provider will analyse and handle the request dynamically, and finally the results will be passed back to the 
client. They can get most up-to-date farming and propagation techniques, pest control knowledge, and can also track and check 
the whole process from production, distribution to consumption. They can also leverage the systematic methods in information 
collection, supply chain logistics, market forecasting and business decision-making. 

In  such  virtual  supply  chains,  planning,  orchestration  and  coordination  are  based  on  virtual  representations  of  physical 
products  and  resources,  enabled  by  new  information  and  communication  technologies.  The  actors  responsible  for  planning, 
orchestration and coordination are not necessarily the ones handling and observing these physical objects. They can be at total 
different locations. [1] The latest and most promising area of ICT is Cloud Computing. It enables the users to make use of 
decentralization or decoupling of physical flows from centralized planning, orchestration, and coordination taking place in other 
locations and by other partners.  

The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has advantage of ubiquitous interconnection of billions of embedded devices that 
can  be  uniquely  identified,  localized,  and  communicated  [2].  IoT  architectures  are  either  Internet  centric  or  object  centric. 
Scalability and cost efficiency of IoT services can be achieved by the integration of cloud-computing into the IoT architecture, 
i.e., cloud-centric IoT [3][5]. Applications that can be improved by the integration of IoT into cloud computing are many, such 
as  pervasive      healthcare  [6],  smart  homes  [7],  smart  cities  [8],  and  future  transportation  systems  [9].  Thus,  Supply  Chain 
management can be efficiently addressed by taking advantage of cloud and IoT integration. 

II. RELATED WORK 

Supply  chain  management  (SCM)  is  the  strategic,  systematic  coordination  of  the  traditional  business  functions  and  the 
tactics  across  business  functions.  The  purposes  of  the  supply  chain  are  to  improve  the  long  term  performance  of  different 
companies. [10] 

The requirements of  the SCM  are  sensing  objects,  the proposed  deployment,  development,  and  management  of the  IoT 

applications over the cloud, namely, cloud-centric IoT framework.  

In  a  cloud-centric  IoT  framework[4],  sensors  provide  their  sensed  data  to  a  storage  cloud  as  a  service,  which  then 
undergoes data analytic and data mining tools for information retrieval and knowledge discovery. Built-in sensors in mobile 
devices can leverage the performance of IoT applications in terms of energy and communication overhead savings [11], [12]. 
Therefore, It has a benefit of strong candidate for front-end access to the cloud-centric IoT, where mobile devices provide their 
sensed data based on the pay-as-you-go fashion [13].  

In our research work, we present a cloud-centric IoT-based framework for supply chain management. We believe that, this 
framework act as central means for planning, orchestration and coordination has potential to enhance performance of supply 
chains. The work gives more focus on how this framework is more helpful in agriculture sector. This sector is making much 
progress in the transaction processing, remote auctioning, and logistics process. Means more stress is given on analyzing the 
existing situation and to define future challenges.

III. LITERATURE REVIEW 

Various systems were proposed for the Supply Chain Management. Nowadays Supply chains are increasingly virtualized in 
response to market challenges and to opportunities offered affording new technologies. Virtual supply chain management has no 
need of physical proximity, which gives control and coordination can take place in other locations and by other partners. This 
paper focus on how the Internet of Things concept can be used to enhance virtualization of supply chains in the floricultural 
sector. The paper defines the concept of virtualization and describes different perspectives. They define a conceptual framework 
for analysis of virtualization in supply chains. [1] 

In  survey  [14],  authors  comes  with  conclusion,  the  environment  accelerate  their  adoption  of  this  game-changing  cloud 
technology  while  effectively  mediating  multiple  sources  of  modularizing  architectures  that  delivering  a  complete  service. 
Introduction of ICT in the agriculture sector is not new to the world.   

Smart phone apps are playing an increasing role on farms for both crop and livestock management. Mobile phones and 
landlines are also the gateway to Web services, and farmers are as likely to take up Internet services as city residents. Authors 
have developed smart farm near Arm dale, New South Wales, to be a technology-intensive property of the future. Experiments 
done with fine scale sensing technologies at Kirby Farm are improving the primary producer’s situation awareness and thus 
contributing to on-farm productivity.[15] 

Developing country like China is exploiting the latest technologies like cloud computing and Internet of Things to make 
direct  contribution  to  agricultural  productivity.  This  paper  [16]  proposes  a  cloud  deployment  model,  Agri-assistant  to  assist 
farmers in efficient decision making which in turn will improve not only the farm productivity but will also help agriculture 
sector to increase its efficiency. 

Cloud computing technology has brought great opportunities to the development of IRAN's agriculture. According to the 
advantages of cloud computing, the paper first discussed the impacts of cloud computing for IRAN’s agricultural development; 
and analyzed the field and the prospects of its possible applications in agriculture; then presented the application and promotion 
of cloud computing technology is a long-term system works with data center, integrate resources. [17] 

Cloud computing is still lagging behind in India, but as economic and institutional factors improve, it greatly accelerate a 
step forward to digital India. If industry and the government can develop products that meet local needs and address issues, the 
cloud might serve as an important catalyst in enhancing social as well as economic growth. [18] 

 

There are different emerging solutions are available to deal with such problems, such as Private players like Star Agri that 
provide  integrated  post-harvest  management  solutions.  TCS’  m-KRISHI  platform  offers  personalized  advisory  services  to 
farmers, via mobile phones to access important information on fertilizers, pesticides, water and soil conservation, and improving 
access to markets for them. [19]. 

IV. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 

Designing  an application  for  agriculture  sector  gives  efficient  optimization of  cloud. Farmers  use  a  cloud-based  trading 

system that mobile phones. The research aims towards 

1.  Design of a cloud-based trading system that disseminates information crop status, harvesting times, and market 

prices. 

2.  Smartness comes with optimization, flexibility, predictability by using cloud in agriculture sector.

consumer. The producer is dependent on the traditional private channels to market her produce, for non-MSP crops. 

An  application  of  Information  Communication  Technology  (ICT)  will  cater  to  all  such  information  needs  of  an  Indian 
farmer at a very reasonable and affordable cost. That latest and most promising area of ICT is Cloud Computing. It enables the 
users to make use of various services and tools with pay-per use basis without the need to know the physical location. Cloud

updated services to their clients in turn. Cloud consists of physical machines in the data centres of cloud providers. The cloud 
provides services like Platform as a Service, Software as a Service or Infrastructure as a Service. Cloud acts as the single point 
of access for serving all customers and internet is the medium for accessing these services.   

Looking at the potential benefits of cloud computing we can list out its role in agricultural development in India. Using the 
applications  of  cloud  the  farmers  have  nothing  to  worry  about  hardware  and  software  investment  and  also  the  technical 
knowledge required to learn them. The farmers will send the request for the specific cloud service using a user friendly device, 
and the cloud service provider will analyse and handle the request dynamically, and finally the results will be passed back to the 
client. They can get most up-to-date farming and propagation techniques, pest control knowledge, and can also track and check 
the whole process from production, distribution to consumption. They can also leverage the systematic methods in information 
collection, supply chain logistics, market forecasting and business decision-making. 

In  such  virtual  supply  chains,  planning,  orchestration  and  coordination  are  based  on  virtual  representations  of  physical 
products  and  resources,  enabled  by  new  information  and  communication  technologies.  The  actors  responsible  for  planning, 
orchestration and coordination are not necessarily the ones handling and observing these physical objects. They can be at total 
different locations. [1] The latest and most promising area of ICT is Cloud Computing. It enables the users to make use of 
decentralization or decoupling of physical flows from centralized planning, orchestration, and coordination taking place in other 
locations and by other partners.  

The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has advantage of ubiquitous interconnection of billions of embedded devices that 
can  be  uniquely  identified,  localized,  and  communicated  [2].  IoT  architectures  are  either  Internet  centric  or  object  centric. 
Scalability and cost efficiency of IoT services can be achieved by the integration of cloud-computing into the IoT architecture, 
i.e., cloud-centric IoT [3][5]. Applications that can be improved by the integration of IoT into cloud computing are many, such 
as  pervasive      healthcare  [6],  smart  homes  [7],  smart  cities  [8],  and  future  transportation  systems  [9].  Thus,  Supply  Chain 
management can be efficiently addressed by taking advantage of cloud and IoT integration. 

II. RELATED WORK 

Supply  chain  management  (SCM)  is  the  strategic,  systematic  coordination  of  the  traditional  business  functions  and  the 
tactics  across  business  functions.  The  purposes  of  the  supply  chain  are  to  improve  the  long  term  performance  of  different 
companies. [10] 

The requirements of  the SCM  are  sensing  objects,  the proposed  deployment,  development,  and  management  of the  IoT 

applications over the cloud, namely, cloud-centric IoT framework.  

In  a  cloud-centric  IoT  framework[4],  sensors  provide  their  sensed  data  to  a  storage  cloud  as  a  service,  which  then 
undergoes data analytic and data mining tools for information retrieval and knowledge discovery. Built-in sensors in mobile 
devices can leverage the performance of IoT applications in terms of energy and communication overhead savings [11], [12]. 
Therefore, It has a benefit of strong candidate for front-end access to the cloud-centric IoT, where mobile devices provide their 
sensed data based on the pay-as-you-go fashion [13].  

In our research work, we present a cloud-centric IoT-based framework for supply chain management. We believe that, this 
framework act as central means for planning, orchestration and coordination has potential to enhance performance of supply 
chains. The work gives more focus on how this framework is more helpful in agriculture sector. This sector is making much 
progress in the transaction processing, remote auctioning, and logistics process. Means more stress is given on analyzing the 
existing situation and to define future challenges. 

An application of Information Communication Technology (ICT), will cater to all such information needs of a farmer at a 
very reasonable and affordable cost. That latest and most promising area of ICT is Cloud Computing. It enables the users to

of the system. 

III. LITERATURE REVIEW 

Various systems were proposed for the Supply Chain Management. Nowadays Supply chains are increasingly virtualized in 
response to market challenges and to opportunities offered affording new technologies. Virtual supply chain management has no 
need of physical proximity, which gives control and coordination can take place in other locations and by other partners. This 
paper focus on how the Internet of Things concept can be used to enhance virtualization of supply chains in the floricultural 
sector. The paper defines the concept of virtualization and describes different perspectives. They define a conceptual framework 
for analysis of virtualization in supply chains. [1] 

In  survey  [14],  authors  comes  with  conclusion,  the  environment  accelerate  their  adoption  of  this  game-changing  cloud 
technology  while  effectively  mediating  multiple  sources  of  modularizing  architectures  that  delivering  a  complete  service. 
Introduction of ICT in the agriculture sector is not new to the world.   

Smart phone apps are playing an increasing role on farms for both crop and livestock management. Mobile phones and 
landlines are also the gateway to Web services, and farmers are as likely to take up Internet services as city residents. Authors 
have developed smart farm near Arm dale, New South Wales, to be a technology-intensive property of the future. Experiments 
done with fine scale sensing technologies at Kirby Farm are improving the primary producer’s situation awareness and thus 
contributing to on-farm productivity.[15] 

Developing country like China is exploiting the latest technologies like cloud computing and Internet of Things to make 
direct  contribution  to  agricultural  productivity.  This  paper  [16]  proposes  a  cloud  deployment  model,  Agri-assistant  to  assist 
farmers in efficient decision making which in turn will improve not only the farm productivity but will also help agriculture 
sector to increase its efficiency. 

Cloud computing technology has brought great opportunities to the development of IRAN's agriculture. According to the 
advantages of cloud computing, the paper first discussed the impacts of cloud computing for IRAN’s agricultural development; 
and analyzed the field and the prospects of its possible applications in agriculture; then presented the application and promotion 
of cloud computing technology is a long-term system works with data center, integrate resources. [17] 

Cloud computing is still lagging behind in India, but as economic and institutional factors improve, it greatly accelerate a 
step forward to digital India. If industry and the government can develop products that meet local needs and address issues, the 
cloud might serve as an important catalyst in enhancing social as well as economic growth. [18] 

 

There are different emerging solutions are available to deal with such problems, such as Private players like Star Agri that 
provide  integrated  post-harvest  management  solutions.  TCS’  m-KRISHI  platform  offers  personalized  advisory  services  to 
farmers, via mobile phones to access important information on fertilizers, pesticides, water and soil conservation, and improving 
access to markets for them. [19].

V. METHODOLOGY  

In this research work, The SCM is primarily concerned with coordination of flow dependencies; the business process output 
of one actor is the input of another actor’s processes. The main component supply chain business processes are orders, products, 
and demand and supply information. Besides these independent dependencies, there are some key dependencies are related to 
the usage of shared resources [1]. In proposed framework for SCM, the control and Coordination of supply chain process is 
based on sensed objects instead direct observation of physical objects. This Cloud based IoT Framework removes fundamental 
constraints concerning place, time and human observations. 

Cloud centric IoT architecture has following layers in proposed framework,   

i.  Object Management  

ii.  Cloud Computing Platform 

iii.  Information as a Service 

iv.  Smart Phone User 

Object Management: 

Objects have central role in SCM, objects are digital representation of information that communicated and processed via 
Internet. In SCM objects are information transferred between different partners from primary production to the market. These 
objects submits sensing task request to the cloud platform and receives sensing data of corresponding task. 

Cloud Computing Platform: 

Maintains  a  user  database  where  objects,  sensing  tasks  and  associated  events  are  stored.  This  middleware  enables  a 
seamless exchange of object information between different supply chain participants. Cloud centric IoT framework processes 
functionalities for service management and service composition. The data exchange and information integration is done by this 
platform. 

Information as a Service: 

This  layer  considered  as  data  publisher  layer  in  this  cloud  centric  IoT  framework  for  Supply  Chain  Management.  The 
specific  service  for  different  supply  chain  user  based  on  the  object  information  made  accessible  by  using  web  interface 
application . 

Smart Phone Users: 

The farmers will send the request for the specific cloud service using a user friendly device such as smart phone users, and 
the cloud service provider will analyze and handle the request dynamically. A user who to publish his sensed object data on 
object management layer must use the benefit of smart phones by installing application on his smart phone.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Agriculture sector is the broadest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall economic growth of India. 
Today, India ranks second worldwide in Agriculture production. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry and fisheries for 
13.7%  of  the  GDP  (Gross  Domestic  Product)  in  2013.  India  is  the  world’s  largest  democracy  with  1.2  billion  populations. 
Despite with its current position, the sector needs to look forward with objective of innovating new things and to stay in the 
lead. The focus has been given on improving production while reducing food supply chain losses. This benefits issue of food 
wastage combating hunger and improving food security. It is difficult to know that how much food is lost and wasted in India 
today due to lack of proper infrastructure. However, a 2011 report by a UN body, gives information about wastage in fruits and 
vegetables as high as 45% of produce (post-harvest to distribution) in India. 

In India, major component of the agro supply chain system is either in the public sector, or strongly associated to it. The 
Indian government decides produce after analysing the costs of growing a particular crop at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), 
decided by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices The role of the buyer, storing the procured produce played by, the 
7500+ Agricultural Procurement and Marketing Committee (APMC) ‘mandis’ provide a marketplace for the transaction and the 
Food Corporation of India (FCI). This gets distributed through the Public Distribution System (PDS) shops and reaches the 
consumer. The producer is dependent on the traditional private channels to market her produce, for non-MSP crops. 

An  application  of  Information  Communication  Technology  (ICT)  will  cater  to  all  such  information  needs  of  an  Indian 
farmer at a very reasonable and affordable cost. That latest and most promising area of ICT is Cloud Computing. It enables the 
users to make use of various services and tools with pay-per use basis without the need to know the physical location. Cloud

functionalities for service management and service composition. The data exchange and information integration is done by this 
platform. 

Information as a Service: 

This  layer  considered  as  data  publisher  layer  in  this  cloud  centric  IoT  framework  for  Supply  Chain  Management.  The 
specific  service  for  different  supply  chain  user  based  on  the  object  information  made  accessible  by  using  web  interface 
application . 

Smart Phone Users: 

The farmers will send the request for the specific cloud service using a user friendly device such as smart phone users, and 
the cloud service provider will analyze and handle the request dynamically. A user who to publish his sensed object data on 
object management layer must use the benefit of smart phones by installing application on his smart phone.

VI. CONCLUSION 

Modern  technology  is  rapidly  altering  and  enhancing  all  aspects  of  our  lives.  The  communication  sector  has  been 
improving continuously. The Cloud computing is a game changing phase of IT that promises several benefits but the challenges 
too need to be considered when planning for Cloud adoption in agricultural sector. Agriculture has traditionally been maintained 
by families and communities where passing on and sharing of knowledge is regarded very important. The accumulation and 
sharing  of  knowledge  has  resulted  in  better  productivity  and  efficiency.  Agriculture  is  the  embodiment  of  large  amount  of 
ancient  knowledge.  If  the  leverage  effects  of  IT  can  be  widely  developed,  then  we  be  able  to  bring  about  a  further  leap  in 
agriculture.  Research  also  continues  to  analyze  Cloud  computing  implementation  that  provides  less  or  no  expenditure,  On-
Demand, Efficient Agricultural Knowledge Management. The cloud can offer a centralized knowledge bank which plays a big 
role in agriculture sector.

scalability,  reliability  and  availability  with  utility  computing  model.  This  new  paradigm  of  computing  has  an  immense 
potential in it to be used in the agriculture and in rural development perspective in developing countries like India. There are 
some  crucial  issues  to  be  solved  to  successfully  deploy  cloud  computing  for  these  social  purposes.  With  the  evolution  of 
Cloud  Computing  and  its  subsequent  popularity,  the  service  providers  are  coming  up  with  very  essay  and  affordable 
solutions for the end users. This technology is predicted to bring revolutionary changes to the agriculture sector. Supply 
chains  are  increasingly  virtualized  with  the  objective  of  building  a  synchronizing  supply  with  demand  competitive 
infrastructure,  creating  net  value  and  measuring  performance.  This  paper  focuses  on  how  Cloud  Computing  concept 
enhances virtualization of supply chains in   agriculture sector. Farmers can get most up-to-date farming and propagation 
techniques, also track and check the whole process from production, distribution to consumption. 

Keywords: Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Supply Chain Management, Virtual Commerce, Agriculture.       

I. INTRODUCTION 

Agriculture sector is the broadest economic sector and plays a significant role in the overall economic growth of India. 
Today, India ranks second worldwide in Agriculture production. Agriculture and allied sectors like forestry and fisheries for 
13.7%  of  the  GDP  (Gross  Domestic  Product)  in  2013.  India  is  the  world’s  largest  democracy  with  1.2  billion  populations. 
Despite with its current position, the sector needs to look forward with objective of innovating new things and to stay in the 
lead. The focus has been given on improving production while reducing food supply chain losses. This benefits issue of food 
wastage combating hunger and improving food security. It is difficult to know that how much food is lost and wasted in India 
today due to lack of proper infrastructure. However, a 2011 report by a UN body, gives information about wastage in fruits and 
vegetables as high as 45% of produce (post-harvest to distribution) in India. 

In India, major component of the agro supply chain system is either in the public sector, or strongly associated to it. The 
Indian government decides produce after analysing the costs of growing a particular crop at Minimum Support Prices (MSPs), 
decided by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices The role of the buyer, storing the procured produce played by, the 
7500+ Agricultural Procurement and Marketing Committee (APMC) ‘mandis’ provide a marketplace for the transaction and the 
Food Corporation of India (FCI). This gets distributed through the Public Distribution System (PDS) shops and reaches the 
consumer. The producer is dependent on the traditional private channels to market her produce, for non-MSP crops. 

An  application  of  Information  Communication  Technology  (ICT)  will  cater  to  all  such  information  needs  of  an  Indian 
farmer at a very reasonable and affordable cost. That latest and most promising area of ICT is Cloud Computing. It enables the 
users to make use of various services and tools with pay-per use basis without the need to know the physical location. Cloud 
computing is inherits distributed computing, provides On-demand services. Cloud users can provide more available, reliable and

updated services to their clients in turn. Cloud consists of physical machines in the data centres of cloud providers. The cloud 
provides services like Platform as a Service, Software as a Service or Infrastructure as a Service. Cloud acts as the single point 
of access for serving all customers and internet is the medium for accessing these services.   

Looking at the potential benefits of cloud computing we can list out its role in agricultural development in India. Using the 
applications  of  cloud  the  farmers  have  nothing  to  worry  about  hardware  and  software  investment  and  also  the  technical 
knowledge required to learn them. The farmers will send the request for the specific cloud service using a user friendly device, 
and the cloud service provider will analyse and handle the request dynamically, and finally the results will be passed back to the 
client. They can get most up-to-date farming and propagation techniques, pest control knowledge, and can also track and check 
the whole process from production, distribution to consumption. They can also leverage the systematic methods in information 
collection, supply chain logistics, market forecasting and business decision-making. 

In  such  virtual  supply  chains,  planning,  orchestration  and  coordination  are  based  on  virtual  representations  of  physical 
products  and  resources,  enabled  by  new  information  and  communication  technologies.  The  actors  responsible  for  planning, 
orchestration and coordination are not necessarily the ones handling and observing these physical objects. They can be at total 
different locations. [1] The latest and most promising area of ICT is Cloud Computing. It enables the users to make use of 
decentralization or decoupling of physical flows from centralized planning, orchestration, and coordination taking place in other 
locations and by other partners.  

The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has advantage of ubiquitous interconnection of billions of embedded devices that 
can  be  uniquely  identified,  localized,  and  communicated  [2].  IoT  architectures  are  either  Internet  centric  or  object  centric. 
Scalability and cost efficiency of IoT services can be achieved by the integration of cloud-computing into the IoT architecture, 
i.e., cloud-centric IoT [3][5]. Applications that can be improved by the integration of IoT into cloud computing are many, such 
as  pervasive      healthcare  [6],  smart  homes  [7],  smart  cities  [8],  and  future  transportation  systems  [9].  Thus,  Supply  Chain 
management can be efficiently addressed by taking advantage of cloud and IoT integration. 

II. RELATED WORK 

Supply  chain  management  (SCM)  is  the  strategic,  systematic  coordination  of  the  traditional  business  functions  and  the 
tactics  across  business  functions.  The  purposes  of  the  supply  chain  are  to  improve  the  long  term  performance  of  different 
companies. [10] 

The requirements of  the SCM  are  sensing  objects,  the proposed  deployment,  development,  and  management  of the  IoT 

applications over the cloud, namely, cloud-centric IoT framework.  

In  a  cloud-centric  IoT  framework[4],  sensors  provide  their  sensed  data  to  a  storage  cloud  as  a  service,  which  then 
undergoes data analytic and data mining tools for information retrieval and knowledge discovery. Built-in sensors in mobile 
devices can leverage the performance of IoT applications in terms of energy and communication overhead savings [11], [12]. 
Therefore, It has a benefit of strong candidate for front-end access to the cloud-centric IoT, where mobile devices provide their 
sensed data based on the pay-as-you-go fashion [13].  

In our research work, we present a cloud-centric IoT-based framework for supply chain management. We believe that, this 
framework act as central means for planning, orchestration and coordination has potential to enhance performance of supply 
chains. The work gives more focus on how this framework is more helpful in agriculture sector. This sector is making much 
progress in the transaction processing, remote auctioning, and logistics process. Means more stress is given on analyzing the 
existing situation and to define future challenges. 

An application of Information Communication Technology (ICT), will cater to all such information needs of a farmer at a 
very reasonable and affordable cost. That latest and most promising area of ICT is Cloud Computing. It enables the users to

make use of various services and tools with pay-per use basis without the need to know the physical location and configuration 
of the system. 

III. LITERATURE REVIEW 

Various systems were proposed for the Supply Chain Management. Nowadays Supply chains are increasingly virtualized in 
response to market challenges and to opportunities offered affording new technologies. Virtual supply chain management has no 
need of physical proximity, which gives control and coordination can take place in other locations and by other partners. This 
paper focus on how the Internet of Things concept can be used to enhance virtualization of supply chains in the floricultural 
sector. The paper defines the concept of virtualization and describes different perspectives. They define a conceptual framework 
for analysis of virtualization in supply chains. [1] 

In  survey  [14],  authors  comes  with  conclusion,  the  environment  accelerate  their  adoption  of  this  game-changing  cloud 
technology  while  effectively  mediating  multiple  sources  of  modularizing  architectures  that  delivering  a  complete  service. 
Introduction of ICT in the agriculture sector is not new to the world.   

Smart phone apps are playing an increasing role on farms for both crop and livestock management. Mobile phones and 
landlines are also the gateway to Web services, and farmers are as likely to take up Internet services as city residents. Authors 
have developed smart farm near Arm dale, New South Wales, to be a technology-intensive property of the future. Experiments 
done with fine scale sensing technologies at Kirby Farm are improving the primary producer’s situation awareness and thus 
contributing to on-farm productivity.[15] 

Developing country like China is exploiting the latest technologies like cloud computing and Internet of Things to make 
direct  contribution  to  agricultural  productivity.  This  paper  [16]  proposes  a  cloud  deployment  model,  Agri-assistant  to  assist 
farmers in efficient decision making which in turn will improve not only the farm productivity but will also help agriculture 
sector to increase its efficiency. 

Cloud computing technology has brought great opportunities to the development of IRAN's agriculture. According to the 
advantages of cloud computing, the paper first discussed the impacts of cloud computing for IRAN’s agricultural development; 
and analyzed the field and the prospects of its possible applications in agriculture; then presented the application and promotion 
of cloud computing technology is a long-term system works with data center, integrate resources. [17] 

Cloud computing is still lagging behind in India, but as economic and institutional factors improve, it greatly accelerate a 
step forward to digital India. If industry and the government can develop products that meet local needs and address issues, the 
cloud might serve as an important catalyst in enhancing social as well as economic growth. [18] 

 

There are different emerging solutions are available to deal with such problems, such as Private players like Star Agri that 
provide  integrated  post-harvest  management  solutions.  TCS’  m-KRISHI  platform  offers  personalized  advisory  services  to 
farmers, via mobile phones to access important information on fertilizers, pesticides, water and soil conservation, and improving 
access to markets for them. [19]. 

IV. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 

Designing  an application  for  agriculture  sector  gives  efficient  optimization of  cloud. Farmers  use  a  cloud-based  trading 

system that mobile phones. The research aims towards 

1.  Design of a cloud-based trading system that disseminates information crop status, harvesting times, and market 

prices. 

2.  Smartness comes with optimization, flexibility, predictability by using cloud in agriculture sector.

Internet of Things has a huge potential in the agriculture field It gives plants a tongue to speak to us 

By using cloud computing we can list out its role in agricultural development in India. Using the applications of cloud the 
farmers  have  nothing  to  worry  about  hardware  and  software  investment  and  also  the  technical  knowledge  required  to  learn 
them.  The  farmers  will  send  the  request  for  the  specific  cloud  service  using  a  user  friendly  device,  and  the  cloud  service 
provider will analyze and handle the request dynamically, and finally the results will be passed back to the client. 

V. METHODOLOGY  

In this research work, The SCM is primarily concerned with coordination of flow dependencies; the business process output 
of one actor is the input of another actor’s processes. The main component supply chain business processes are orders, products, 
and demand and supply information. Besides these independent dependencies, there are some key dependencies are related to 
the usage of shared resources [1]. In proposed framework for SCM, the control and Coordination of supply chain process is 
based on sensed objects instead direct observation of physical objects. This Cloud based IoT Framework removes fundamental 
constraints concerning place, time and human observations. 

Cloud centric IoT architecture has following layers in proposed framework,   

i.  Object Management  

ii.  Cloud Computing Platform 

iii.  Information as a Service 

iv.  Smart Phone User 

Object Management: 

Objects have central role in SCM, objects are digital representation of information that communicated and processed via 
Internet. In SCM objects are information transferred between different partners from primary production to the market. These 
objects submits sensing task request to the cloud platform and receives sensing data of corresponding task. 

Cloud Computing Platform: 

Maintains  a  user  database  where  objects,  sensing  tasks  and  associated  events  are  stored.  This  middleware  enables  a 
seamless exchange of object information between different supply chain participants. Cloud centric IoT framework processes 
functionalities for service management and service composition. The data exchange and information integration is done by this 
platform. 

Information as a Service: 

This  layer  considered  as  data  publisher  layer  in  this  cloud  centric  IoT  framework  for  Supply  Chain  Management.  The 
specific  service  for  different  supply  chain  user  based  on  the  object  information  made  accessible  by  using  web  interface 
application . 

Smart Phone Users: 

The farmers will send the request for the specific cloud service using a user friendly device such as smart phone users, and 
the cloud service provider will analyze and handle the request dynamically. A user who to publish his sensed object data on 
object management layer must use the benefit of smart phones by installing application on his smart phone.
