more  stringent,  less  flexible  and  intrusive.  Scalability

INTRODUCTION 

The IoT is service-oriented architecture and is mandato-
ry subset of future Internet where every virtual or physi-
cal thing can communicate with every other thing giving 
seamless service to all stakeholders. The IoT is conver-
gence  of  sensors,  (Radio  Frequency  Identification) 
RFID, smart devices and anything with sensing, compu-
ting  and  communication  capability.  Devices  with  com-
munication  and  computation  capability  with  resource 
constraints  are  attached  to  the  things.  The  realistic  no-
tion of the IoT [1] has been seen with the development 
of technologies such as handheld objects, sensors, wire-
less  communication  and  mobile  Internet  access.  Seam-
less  communication  between  ubiquitous  things  in  the 
IoT  possesses  problems  of  addressing  and  IdM.  The 
greater scale and scope of the IoT increases the options 
in  which  a  user  can  interact  with  the  things  in  his/her 
physical and virtual environment. In this context, every-
day  things  are  globally  connected  and  managing  in-
creasing number of things requires scalable and efficient 
addressing  and  IdM  mechanism.  Due  to  increasing 
number  of  connected  things  in  the  IoT,  energy,  ubiqui-
tous  network  access,  secure  user  interaction  increases 
the  complexity  of  operation.  This  broader  scope  of  in-
teractions  enhances  the  need  to  extend  current  IdM 
models  to  include  new  hierarchical  identifiers  and  ad-
dressing based on clustering. Functionalities and opera-

tional  principle  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN) 
makes  it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the 
IoT.  Mobility  of  these  devices,  dynamic  topology  and 
ad-hoc nature  must also be taken into consideration  for 
designing new identification and addressing schemes for 
IoT.  Things,  identities  and  the  interaction  of  the  things 
are  three  major  components  of  future  IoT  and  are  dis-
cussed below as:  

 

 

  Things include resource constrained sensors to 
object  with  RFID  rags.  The  IoT  of  future  will 
include  a  wide  array  of  devices  ranging  from 
high to low computing and communication ca-
pabilities and these things are always linked to 
some namespaces. 
Identities are the windows through which users 
interact with their things and consume services 
in today’s world. In the IoT world, this concept 
of  identity  extends  to  things  [2,  3].  Identities 
can  be  considered  as  end  points  so  that  it  is 
easy to ensure access to end point independent 
of thing being used like PDA or sensor.  
Interaction  which  is  ubiquitous  is  another  im-
portant challenge in the IoT. In the future, IoT 
users  will  be  able  to  discover  and  use  things 
that  are  public,  add  things  temporarily  to  their 
personal  space,  share  their  things  with  others, 
things that are public can be part of the person-
al space of multiple users at the same time, etc. 
and  this  association  will  be  long  term  or  short 
term.  
The  contribution  of  this  paper  is  threefold. 
First,  this  paper  addresses  research  needs  in  identities 
and  identifier  format  for  IoT.  Secondly,  this  paper  pre-
sent new identities and identifier format for devices with 
hierarchical  addressing.  Third,  result  of  comprehensive 
set of simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of clus-
tering  with  hierarchical  addressing  with  new  identifier 
format  is  presented  and  discussed.  Simulation  results 
show  better  performance  in  energy,  end-to-end  delay 
and throughput. CCHA simulation results are also com-
pared with existing solution for failure probability.  
 

This paper is structured as follows: First part of 
this  paper  focuses  on  related  works  in  the  field  of  IdM 
and  addressing  for  IoT  with  limitations.  Next  part  pre-
sents  proposed  CCHA  together  with  concept  of  identi-
ties,  identifiers  in  the  IoT,  and  identifier  format.  This 
paper  also  addresses  the  need  of  CCHA  for  IoT  things 
and  discusses  difference  between  flat  and  hierarchical 
addressing. Next section explains simulation results and 
discussion  together  with  the  mathematical  model  for 
queuing  analysis.  Finally  last  part  concludes  this  paper 
with discussion.

RELATED WORKS 
 
Literature shows that there has been lot of  work for 
IdM  and  identities  but  none  of  the  work  addresses 
IoT.  Meaning of identity and design of identifier in 
the IoT context is one of the main issues in the view 
of resource constraints like energy, lifetime, end-to -
end delay, memory and routing overhead. Identity is 
whatever which makes the thing distinguishable and 
delineate.    Thing  under  consideration  only  has  one 
identity but  might be associated  with  many  identifi-
ers. These identifiers are  used to distinct  two things 
from each other and are context dependent. Different 
identity schemes have been proposed in the IoT and 
it  is  predicted  that  it  is  dubious  to  have  common 
identification  schemes  globally  [2].  Identification 
schemes  for  RFID  Object  Identifier,  EPCglobal, 
Short-OID  and  Near  Field  Communications  Forum 
have been studied in [2]. In [3], author addresses the 
IdM  problem  in  the  IoT  with  challenges  and 
roadmap and presents naming and addressing as one 
of the main issues for the IoT. New concept of virtu-
al  identities  for  the  IoT  is  presented  in  [4]  but  ad-
dressing  and  implementation  details  are  left  un-
addressed.  An  author  presents  the  domain  trusted 
entity  where  each  identity  is  managed  by  a  trusted 
entity  of  its  corresponding  home  domain  that  keeps 
it  under  the  preferences  set  by  its  holder.  This  ap-
proach  is  not  suitable  for  futuristic  IoT  due  to  its 
dynamic  topology  and  distributed  nature.  Use  of 
clustering  for  efficient  resource  management  in  the 
IoT is proposed in [5] achieving lifetime of network, 
scalability  and  reduced  packet  delay.  [6]  Proposes 
multi-hop  clustering  protocol  for  WSN  without  ad-
dressing  mobility.  There  have  been  many  attempts 
on  hierarchical  addressing  but  all  are  focusing  IP 
networks, Internet domain level in the current inter-
net  and  not  suitable  for  IoT  [7,  8,  and  9].  The  Do-
main  Name  System  (DNS)  is  a  hierarchical  naming 
system built on a distributed database for computers, 
services, or any resource connected to the Internet or 
a private network [10]. DNS is not suited for critical 
infrastructure and is prone to spoofing and authenti-
cation  problem.    Meanwhile,  the  Distributed  Hash 
Table  (DHT)  is  adopted  as  the  underlying  structure 
to  construct  the  basic  UID  management  methodolo-
gy [11]. Problems using DHT for IdM are achieving 
load  balancing  while  mapping  keys  to  nodes  and 
forwarding lookup for a key to appropriate node.  
 

Each thing in the IoT is always linked to some 
namespace. The notion of namespace here is much clos-
er to the notion of scenario or application under consid-
eration  as  well  as  context  in  which  things  operate  and 
provide  service.  Things  are  classified  into  two  types  as 
either things that are computers equipped with commu-
nication  interfaces  or  things  which  are  not  computers 
but  are  associated  with  computers  equipped  with  com-
munication interfaces. To this purpose, there is a need to

design  new  hierarchical  identifiers,  applying  hierar-
chical  addressing  by  grouping  the  objects  into  domains 
and clusters.  

PROPOSED NOVEL CONTEXT-AWARE 
CLUSTERING WITH HIRARCHICAL 
ADDRESSING (CCHA)  

Functionalities and operational principle of WSN makes 
it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the  IoT.  De-
vices  with  ubiquitous  and  wireless  communication  ca-
pabilities  are  attached  to  the  object  satisfying  the  need 
of IoT. Dynamic  network topology,  collaborative,  mul-
ti-hop communication and interactions of devices in all 
way  can  be  achieved  using  clustering  resulting  into 
scalability.  We define clustering as grouping of similar 
objects/devices or sensors in given context by achieving 
logical  organizing.  In  the  IoT,  this  paper  classifies 
things  into  three  types  as  people  (Users),  devices 
(Things)  and  information  (cloth,  medicine).  Depending 
on  the  context,  there  are  different  types  of  clustering 
like static, dynamic, single hop and multi hop, homoge-
nous and heterogeneous. This paper argues that cluster-
ing  reduces  the  number  of  devices  taking  part  in  trans-
mission  resulting  in  useful  energy  consumption;  scala-
bility  for  large  number  of  devices  and  also  reduces 
communication  overhead  for  single  hop  and  multi  hop 
communication  maintaining  namespaces.  Clustering 
algorithm can be classified as heuristic,  weighted, hier-
archical 
[12, 
13].Heuristic  algorithms  are  metrics  independent  algo-
rithms  and  gives  reasonable  performance  with  optimal 
solution. In heuristic  method  of clustering, cluster  head 
can  be  selected  depending  on  the  node  ID  or  neighbor 
also  can  be  selected  as  cluster  head.  In  weighted 
schemes,  weight  function  is  calculated  depending  on 
parameters  like  transmission  power,  mobility  and  ener-
gy of the node. This weighted function is used to select 
cluster head. In grid scheme, nodes are arranged in grid 
like structure and grid is built dynamically and random-
ly.  As  clustering  algorithm  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this 
paper,  we  use  normal  clustering  to  create  domain  and 
one  node  is  cluster  head  in  each  cluster.  Example  sce-
nario is shown in the Figure 1.

  Things include resource constrained sensors to 
object  with  RFID  rags.  The  IoT  of  future  will 
include  a  wide  array  of  devices  ranging  from 
high to low computing and communication ca-
pabilities and these things are always linked to 
some namespaces. 
Identities are the windows through which users 
interact with their things and consume services 
in today’s world. In the IoT world, this concept 
of  identity  extends  to  things  [2,  3].  Identities 
can  be  considered  as  end  points  so  that  it  is 
easy to ensure access to end point independent 
of thing being used like PDA or sensor.  
Interaction  which  is  ubiquitous  is  another  im-
portant challenge in the IoT. In the future, IoT 
users  will  be  able  to  discover  and  use  things 
that  are  public,  add  things  temporarily  to  their 
personal  space,  share  their  things  with  others, 
things that are public can be part of the person-
al space of multiple users at the same time, etc. 
and  this  association  will  be  long  term  or  short 
term.  
The  contribution  of  this  paper  is  threefold. 
First,  this  paper  addresses  research  needs  in  identities 
and  identifier  format  for  IoT.  Secondly,  this  paper  pre-
sent new identities and identifier format for devices with 
hierarchical  addressing.  Third,  result  of  comprehensive 
set of simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of clus-
tering  with  hierarchical  addressing  with  new  identifier 
format  is  presented  and  discussed.  Simulation  results 
show  better  performance  in  energy,  end-to-end  delay 
and throughput. CCHA simulation results are also com-
pared with existing solution for failure probability.  
 

This paper is structured as follows: First part of 
this  paper  focuses  on  related  works  in  the  field  of  IdM 
and  addressing  for  IoT  with  limitations.  Next  part  pre-
sents  proposed  CCHA  together  with  concept  of  identi-
ties,  identifiers  in  the  IoT,  and  identifier  format.  This 
paper  also  addresses  the  need  of  CCHA  for  IoT  things 
and  discusses  difference  between  flat  and  hierarchical 
addressing. Next section explains simulation results and 
discussion  together  with  the  mathematical  model  for 
queuing  analysis.  Finally  last  part  concludes  this  paper 
with discussion.  

RELATED WORKS 
 
Literature shows that there has been lot of  work for 
IdM  and  identities  but  none  of  the  work  addresses 
IoT.  Meaning of identity and design of identifier in 
the IoT context is one of the main issues in the view 
of resource constraints like energy, lifetime, end-to -
end delay, memory and routing overhead. Identity is 
whatever which makes the thing distinguishable and 
delineate.    Thing  under  consideration  only  has  one 
identity but  might be associated  with  many  identifi-
ers. These identifiers are  used to distinct  two things 
from each other and are context dependent. Different 
identity schemes have been proposed in the IoT and 
it  is  predicted  that  it  is  dubious  to  have  common 
identification  schemes  globally  [2].  Identification 
schemes  for  RFID  Object  Identifier,  EPCglobal, 
Short-OID  and  Near  Field  Communications  Forum 
have been studied in [2]. In [3], author addresses the 
IdM  problem  in  the  IoT  with  challenges  and 
roadmap and presents naming and addressing as one 
of the main issues for the IoT. New concept of virtu-
al  identities  for  the  IoT  is  presented  in  [4]  but  ad-
dressing  and  implementation  details  are  left  un-
addressed.  An  author  presents  the  domain  trusted 
entity  where  each  identity  is  managed  by  a  trusted 
entity  of  its  corresponding  home  domain  that  keeps 
it  under  the  preferences  set  by  its  holder.  This  ap-
proach  is  not  suitable  for  futuristic  IoT  due  to  its 
dynamic  topology  and  distributed  nature.  Use  of 
clustering  for  efficient  resource  management  in  the 
IoT is proposed in [5] achieving lifetime of network, 
scalability  and  reduced  packet  delay.  [6]  Proposes 
multi-hop  clustering  protocol  for  WSN  without  ad-
dressing  mobility.  There  have  been  many  attempts 
on  hierarchical  addressing  but  all  are  focusing  IP 
networks, Internet domain level in the current inter-
net  and  not  suitable  for  IoT  [7,  8,  and  9].  The  Do-
main  Name  System  (DNS)  is  a  hierarchical  naming 
system built on a distributed database for computers, 
services, or any resource connected to the Internet or 
a private network [10]. DNS is not suited for critical 
infrastructure and is prone to spoofing and authenti-
cation  problem.    Meanwhile,  the  Distributed  Hash 
Table  (DHT)  is  adopted  as  the  underlying  structure 
to  construct  the  basic  UID  management  methodolo-
gy [11]. Problems using DHT for IdM are achieving 
load  balancing  while  mapping  keys  to  nodes  and 
forwarding lookup for a key to appropriate node.  
 

Each thing in the IoT is always linked to some 
namespace. The notion of namespace here is much clos-
er to the notion of scenario or application under consid-
eration  as  well  as  context  in  which  things  operate  and 
provide  service.  Things  are  classified  into  two  types  as 
either things that are computers equipped with commu-
nication  interfaces  or  things  which  are  not  computers 
but  are  associated  with  computers  equipped  with  com-
munication interfaces. To this purpose, there is a need to

design  new  hierarchical  identifiers,  applying  hierar-

and clusters.  

PROPOSED NOVEL CONTEXT-AWARE 
CLUSTERING WITH HIRARCHICAL 
ADDRESSING (CCHA)  

Functionalities and operational principle of WSN makes 
it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the  IoT.  De-
vices  with  ubiquitous  and  wireless  communication  ca-
pabilities  are  attached  to  the  object  satisfying  the  need 
of IoT. Dynamic  network topology,  collaborative,  mul-
ti-hop communication and interactions of devices in all 
way  can  be  achieved  using  clustering  resulting  into 
scalability.  We define clustering as grouping of similar 
objects/devices or sensors in given context by achieving 
logical  organizing.  In  the  IoT,  this  paper  classifies 
things  into  three  types  as  people  (Users),  devices 
(Things)  and  information  (cloth,  medicine).  Depending 
on  the  context,  there  are  different  types  of  clustering 
like static, dynamic, single hop and multi hop, homoge-
nous and heterogeneous. This paper argues that cluster-
ing  reduces  the  number  of  devices  taking  part  in  trans-
mission  resulting  in  useful  energy  consumption;  scala-
bility  for  large  number  of  devices  and  also  reduces 
communication  overhead  for  single  hop  and  multi  hop 
communication  maintaining  namespaces.  Clustering 
algorithm can be classified as heuristic,  weighted, hier-
archical 
[12, 
13].Heuristic  algorithms  are  metrics  independent  algo-
rithms  and  gives  reasonable  performance  with  optimal 
solution. In heuristic  method  of clustering, cluster  head 
can  be  selected  depending  on  the  node  ID  or  neighbor 
also  can  be  selected  as  cluster  head.  In  weighted 
schemes,  weight  function  is  calculated  depending  on 
parameters  like  transmission  power,  mobility  and  ener-
gy of the node. This weighted function is used to select 
cluster head. In grid scheme, nodes are arranged in grid 
like structure and grid is built dynamically and random-
ly.  As  clustering  algorithm  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this 
paper,  we  use  normal  clustering  to  create  domain  and 
one  node  is  cluster  head  in  each  cluster.  Example  sce-
nario is shown in the Figure 1.

Use of hierarchical addressing is explained be-
low.  With  the  help  of  hierarchical  addressing,  we  can 
apply structure to identifiers such that left parts of iden-
tifier refer to individual block of network and right part 
refers  to  individual  node.  Advantages  of  hierarchical 
addressing  are  easy  manageability  with  optimized  per-
formance,  scalability  and  low  memory  and  bandwidth 
requirements.  Main  property  of  hierarchical  addressing 
is  that  it  support  aggregation  feature.  Aggregation  is  a 
summarization i.e.  grouping  of  many  identifiers  for  en-
hanced  routing  performance  and  stability.  Routing  is 
simplified by hierarchical addressing because sequences 
of steps are depending on individual  field. Hierarchical 
addresses  can  also  be  assigned  without  the  need  for  a 
central  authority  and  ellipsis  of  addresses  for  local 
namespace  use  is  easy.  Hierarchical  addresses  are  easy 
to change in case of mobility of devices in the IoT sub-
ject  to  efficient  use  of  address  space  and  suitable  con-
text dependent clustering.  Routing becomes complex in 
case  of  flat  addressing  as,  there  is  no  relationship  be-
tween actual address and the  naming  system. The  most 
famous addressing solution is Dynamic Host Configura-
tion  Protocol  (DHCP)  [14]  which  provides  configura-
tion  parameters  for  internet  host  and  is  based  on  client 
server model. In IoT, access to DHCP server for address 
assignment  cannot  be  guaranteed.  Distributed  Address 
Assignment (DAA) is presented in Zigbee Alliance [15] 
where  free  address  is  assigned  to  new  device  through 
association process. The probability that the device may 
fail to acquire an available address from its neighbors is 
more  in  DAA.  This  addressing  failure  occurs  due  to 
shortage of addresses or geographical location of devic-
es.  Pre-emptive  Distributed  Address  Assignment 
(PDAA) which is an automatic address assignment with 
unicity  is  presented  in  [16]  but  it  is  designed  for  fixed 
WSN. Due to this limitation, it is not possible to use this 
in  the  IoT.  Different  between  flat  and  hierarchical  ad-
dressing  based  on  different  parameters  is  given  in  the

A.  Proposed Identifier Format 

This section describes proposed  work  for identities and 
identities for IoT.  
 

a.  Identifiers in IoT 

An  identifier  discerns  different  users,  place  or 
thing  within 
the  context  of  specific  namespace. 
Namespace  plays  important  role  in  defining  identifier 
because  identifiers  are  always  local  to  the  current 
namespace.  For  example  user  and  sensor  both  have 
identifiers. User may be associated with bank, his office 
or  home.  Here  bank,  office  and  home  are  different 
namespaces  and  each  will  have  different  identifiers. 
Each identifier is meaningful in the namespace and only 
when  associated  with  thing  being  identified.  Example 
for CAR entity and its identifiers are shown in below.  

CAR =    {VIN, LICENCE PLATE, TYPE} 

 

CAR  has  three  identifiers  and  association  of 
CAR with one of the identifier is used depending on the 
context  and  the  namespace.  Precisely,  identifier  can  be 
defined in generic way as having three parameters as 
Identifier = {Thing, Identifier, Namespace} 

 
e.g.    {CAR  ,  VIN  ,  RTO_DB  }  ,  {  SENSOR  , 
NODE_ID , HOME_GATEWAY } , { TAG , EPCID 
, LOCAL_DB }  

 

 

Things  are  associated  with  many  identifiers 

and are show in the Figure 2.  

Fig. 2: Things and Identifiers in IoT 

 

 

An  attribute  is  dedicated  characteristic  associ-
ated with an entity like sensor node or object with RFID 
tag  in  the  IoT.  As  attributes  are  only  going  to  be  ex-
changed  for  association  with  an  identifiers,  meaningful 
attributes of things need to be defined for the IoT along 
with the scope rules. Attributes will vary from personal 
space  to  public  space.    Broadly,  there  are  two  types  of 
attributes  persistent  attribute  which  are  permanent  at-
tributes of thing and non-persistent attributes which are 
temporary attributes of things.  This paper proposes that 
each thing should be associated with at least one persis-
tent and one non-persistent attribute in the IoT. As both 
types of attribute will have different meaning in the lo-
cal context.

Abstract:  As  computing  technology  becomes  more 
tightly  coupled  into  dynamic  and  mobile  world  of  the 
Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  security  mechanism  becomes 
more  stringent,  less  flexible  and  intrusive.  Scalability 
issue  in  the  IoT  makes  Identity  Management  (IdM)  of 
ubiquitous  things  more  challenging.    Forming  ad-hoc 
network,  interaction  between  these  nomadic  devices  to 
provide seamless service extend the need of new identi-
ties  to  the  things,  addressing  and  IdM  in  the  IoT.  New 
identities  and  identifier  format  to  alleviate  the  perfor-
mance issue is introduced in this paper. This paper pre-
sents novel Context-aware Clustering  with Hierarchical 
Addressing  (CCHA)  scheme  for  the  things  with  new 
identifier  format.  Simulation  results  shows  that  CCHA 
achieves  better  performance  with  less  energy  expendi-
ture, less end-to-end delay and more throughput. Results 
also  show  that  CCHA  significantly  reduces  the  failure 
probability.    Furthermore,  this  paper  also  presents  the 
framework for IdM in  the IoT and mathematical model 
for queuing analysis.

INTRODUCTION 

The IoT is service-oriented architecture and is mandato-
ry subset of future Internet where every virtual or physi-
cal thing can communicate with every other thing giving 
seamless service to all stakeholders. The IoT is conver-
gence  of  sensors,  (Radio  Frequency  Identification) 
RFID, smart devices and anything with sensing, compu-
ting  and  communication  capability.  Devices  with  com-
munication  and  computation  capability  with  resource 
constraints  are  attached  to  the  things.  The  realistic  no-
tion of the IoT [1] has been seen with the development 
of technologies such as handheld objects, sensors, wire-
less  communication  and  mobile  Internet  access.  Seam-
less  communication  between  ubiquitous  things  in  the 
IoT  possesses  problems  of  addressing  and  IdM.  The 
greater scale and scope of the IoT increases the options 
in  which  a  user  can  interact  with  the  things  in  his/her 
physical and virtual environment. In this context, every-
day  things  are  globally  connected  and  managing  in-
creasing number of things requires scalable and efficient 
addressing  and  IdM  mechanism.  Due  to  increasing 
number  of  connected  things  in  the  IoT,  energy,  ubiqui-
tous  network  access,  secure  user  interaction  increases 
the  complexity  of  operation.  This  broader  scope  of  in-
teractions  enhances  the  need  to  extend  current  IdM 
models  to  include  new  hierarchical  identifiers  and  ad-
dressing based on clustering. Functionalities and opera-

paper,  we  use  normal  clustering  to  create  domain  and 
one  node  is  cluster  head  in  each  cluster.  Example  sce-

Use of hierarchical addressing is explained be-
low.  With  the  help  of  hierarchical  addressing,  we  can 
apply structure to identifiers such that left parts of iden-
tifier refer to individual block of network and right part 
refers  to  individual  node.  Advantages  of  hierarchical 
addressing  are  easy  manageability  with  optimized  per-
formance,  scalability  and  low  memory  and  bandwidth 
requirements.  Main  property  of  hierarchical  addressing 
is  that  it  support  aggregation  feature.  Aggregation  is  a 
summarization i.e.  grouping  of  many  identifiers  for  en-
hanced  routing  performance  and  stability.  Routing  is 
simplified by hierarchical addressing because sequences 
of steps are depending on individual  field. Hierarchical 
addresses  can  also  be  assigned  without  the  need  for  a 
central  authority  and  ellipsis  of  addresses  for  local 
namespace  use  is  easy.  Hierarchical  addresses  are  easy 
to change in case of mobility of devices in the IoT sub-
ject  to  efficient  use  of  address  space  and  suitable  con-
text dependent clustering.  Routing becomes complex in 
case  of  flat  addressing  as,  there  is  no  relationship  be-
tween actual address and the  naming  system. The  most 
famous addressing solution is Dynamic Host Configura-
tion  Protocol  (DHCP)  [14]  which  provides  configura-
tion  parameters  for  internet  host  and  is  based  on  client 
server model. In IoT, access to DHCP server for address 
assignment  cannot  be  guaranteed.  Distributed  Address 
Assignment (DAA) is presented in Zigbee Alliance [15] 
where  free  address  is  assigned  to  new  device  through 
association process. The probability that the device may 
fail to acquire an available address from its neighbors is 
more  in  DAA.  This  addressing  failure  occurs  due  to 
shortage of addresses or geographical location of devic-
es.  Pre-emptive  Distributed  Address  Assignment 
(PDAA) which is an automatic address assignment with 
unicity  is  presented  in  [16]  but  it  is  designed  for  fixed 
WSN. Due to this limitation, it is not possible to use this 
in  the  IoT.  Different  between  flat  and  hierarchical  ad-
dressing  based  on  different  parameters  is  given  in  the

A.  Proposed Identifier Format 

This section describes proposed  work  for identities and 
identities for IoT.  
 

a.  Identifiers in IoT 

An  identifier  discerns  different  users,  place  or 
thing  within 
the  context  of  specific  namespace. 
Namespace  plays  important  role  in  defining  identifier 
because  identifiers  are  always  local  to  the  current 
namespace.  For  example  user  and  sensor  both  have 
identifiers. User may be associated with bank, his office 
or  home.  Here  bank,  office  and  home  are  different 
namespaces  and  each  will  have  different  identifiers. 
Each identifier is meaningful in the namespace and only 
when  associated  with  thing  being  identified.  Example 
for CAR entity and its identifiers are shown in below.  

CAR =    {VIN, LICENCE PLATE, TYPE} 

 

CAR  has  three  identifiers  and  association  of 
CAR with one of the identifier is used depending on the 
context  and  the  namespace.  Precisely,  identifier  can  be 
defined in generic way as having three parameters as 
Identifier = {Thing, Identifier, Namespace} 

 
e.g.    {CAR  ,  VIN  ,  RTO_DB  }  ,  {  SENSOR  , 
NODE_ID , HOME_GATEWAY } , { TAG , EPCID 
, LOCAL_DB }  

 

 

Things  are  associated  with  many  identifiers 

and are show in the Figure 2.  

Fig. 2: Things and Identifiers in IoT 

 

 

An  attribute  is  dedicated  characteristic  associ-
ated with an entity like sensor node or object with RFID 
tag  in  the  IoT.  As  attributes  are  only  going  to  be  ex-
changed  for  association  with  an  identifiers,  meaningful 
attributes of things need to be defined for the IoT along 
with the scope rules. Attributes will vary from personal 
space  to  public  space.    Broadly,  there  are  two  types  of 
attributes  persistent  attribute  which  are  permanent  at-
tributes of thing and non-persistent attributes which are 
temporary attributes of things.  This paper proposes that 
each thing should be associated with at least one persis-
tent and one non-persistent attribute in the IoT. As both 
types of attribute will have different meaning in the lo-
cal context.  

b.  Identification and Identifier Format  

 

Association of identifier with thing presenting an attrib-
ute  is  called  as  identification.  For  example,  thing  is 
PDA  with  ID1,  this  example  includes  accepting  the  as-
sociation between thing PDA and its attribute as ID1. As 
discussed in above section, things can have many identi-
fiers and each identifier has to be associated with it de-
pending  on  the  context.  Identification  is  applicable  to 
both things and users and requires identifier. Things are 
always  acquiring  some  attributes  and  authentication  is 
referred  as  collection  of  proofs  for  attribute.  When 
things  communicate  with  each  other,  or  provide  any 
service,  they  always  provide  some  attribute  along  with 
identifier to authenticate. Identification is represented as 

{Thing identified, thing} ε Namespace 

 

IdM  is  set  of  processes  that  consist  of  identity 
binding,  identity  mapping  and  authentication.  It  in-
volves  management  and  exchange  of  thing  identity  in-
formation  also  known  as  digital  identity.  Precisely  we 
define IdM as management of identity followed by iden-
tity  authentication  and  attribute  authentication.  In  the 
IoT, each end point user, service or thing will be repre-
sented by an identity and identity is set of temporary or 
permanent  attributes  of  things.  Depending  on  the  con-
text  in  use,  the  separate  context  identity  (CID)  [17]  is 
used  with  the  help  of  domain  and  clustering  as  dis-
cussed  in  above  section.  In  order  to  support  context 
awareness and applying namespace dependent identifier 
to  thing,  utilization  of  context  information  is  important 
aspect. General definition of context is any information 
that can be used to classify the situation of an entity. An 
entity  is  a  person,  place,  or  object  that  is  considered 
relevant to the interaction between  a user and an appli-
cation. It is clear that such information is very important 
to  select  apply  appropriate  identifier  to  thing.  We  pro-
pose framework for IdM in the IoT in which IdM is one 
layer  with  the  set  of  processes  mentioned  above.  Con-
text management, identity binding, mapping and lifecy-
cle  management are key  milestones  which takes identi-
ties  and  credentials  as  an  input.  This  proposed  frame-
work is shown in the Figure 3.  
 

Fig. 3: Proposed Framework for IdM in the IoT

Figure  4  shows  identifier  format  for  things  in 
the IoT. As discussed in above sections, nomadic things 
in  the  IoT  can  join  to  public  or  private  IoT.  In  this  re-
gards, it is essential to assign ownership to these things. 
As  things  can  be  people,  thing  or  information  and  this 
classification  must  be  present  as  one  the  parameter  in 
format. It should be easy to know the thing is RFID tag, 
sensor node, sensor network or PDA. For unique identi-
fication  purpose,  unique  identifiers  like  EUI-64  bit  of 
802.15.4,  EPC  code  [2]  or  any  other  unique  identifiers 
are associated with format. This format for thing should 
have  association  with  the  different  attributes  and  these 
attributes  are  decided on  the  namespace  in  which  thing 
is being used.

Abstract:  As  computing  technology  becomes  more 
tightly  coupled  into  dynamic  and  mobile  world  of  the 
Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  security  mechanism  becomes 
more  stringent,  less  flexible  and  intrusive.  Scalability 
issue  in  the  IoT  makes  Identity  Management  (IdM)  of 
ubiquitous  things  more  challenging.    Forming  ad-hoc 
network,  interaction  between  these  nomadic  devices  to 
provide seamless service extend the need of new identi-
ties  to  the  things,  addressing  and  IdM  in  the  IoT.  New 
identities  and  identifier  format  to  alleviate  the  perfor-
mance issue is introduced in this paper. This paper pre-
sents novel Context-aware Clustering  with Hierarchical 
Addressing  (CCHA)  scheme  for  the  things  with  new 
identifier  format.  Simulation  results  shows  that  CCHA 
achieves  better  performance  with  less  energy  expendi-
ture, less end-to-end delay and more throughput. Results 
also  show  that  CCHA  significantly  reduces  the  failure 
probability.    Furthermore,  this  paper  also  presents  the 
framework for IdM in  the IoT and mathematical model 
for queuing analysis.

ty Management, Internet of Things. 
 
INTRODUCTION 

The IoT is service-oriented architecture and is mandato-
ry subset of future Internet where every virtual or physi-
cal thing can communicate with every other thing giving 
seamless service to all stakeholders. The IoT is conver-
gence  of  sensors,  (Radio  Frequency  Identification) 
RFID, smart devices and anything with sensing, compu-
ting  and  communication  capability.  Devices  with  com-
munication  and  computation  capability  with  resource 
constraints  are  attached  to  the  things.  The  realistic  no-
tion of the IoT [1] has been seen with the development 
of technologies such as handheld objects, sensors, wire-
less  communication  and  mobile  Internet  access.  Seam-
less  communication  between  ubiquitous  things  in  the 
IoT  possesses  problems  of  addressing  and  IdM.  The 
greater scale and scope of the IoT increases the options 
in  which  a  user  can  interact  with  the  things  in  his/her 
physical and virtual environment. In this context, every-
day  things  are  globally  connected  and  managing  in-
creasing number of things requires scalable and efficient 
addressing  and  IdM  mechanism.  Due  to  increasing 
number  of  connected  things  in  the  IoT,  energy,  ubiqui-
tous  network  access,  secure  user  interaction  increases 
the  complexity  of  operation.  This  broader  scope  of  in-
teractions  enhances  the  need  to  extend  current  IdM 
models  to  include  new  hierarchical  identifiers  and  ad-
dressing based on clustering. Functionalities and opera-

 

1 

tional  principle  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN) 
makes  it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the 
IoT.  Mobility  of  these  devices,  dynamic  topology  and 
ad-hoc nature  must also be taken into consideration  for 
designing new identification and addressing schemes for 
IoT.  Things,  identities  and  the  interaction  of  the  things 
are  three  major  components  of  future  IoT  and  are  dis-
cussed below as:  

 

 

  Things include resource constrained sensors to 
object  with  RFID  rags.  The  IoT  of  future  will 
include  a  wide  array  of  devices  ranging  from 
high to low computing and communication ca-
pabilities and these things are always linked to 
some namespaces. 
Identities are the windows through which users 
interact with their things and consume services 
in today’s world. In the IoT world, this concept 
of  identity  extends  to  things  [2,  3].  Identities 
can  be  considered  as  end  points  so  that  it  is 
easy to ensure access to end point independent 
of thing being used like PDA or sensor.  
Interaction  which  is  ubiquitous  is  another  im-
portant challenge in the IoT. In the future, IoT 
users  will  be  able  to  discover  and  use  things 
that  are  public,  add  things  temporarily  to  their 
personal  space,  share  their  things  with  others, 
things that are public can be part of the person-
al space of multiple users at the same time, etc. 
and  this  association  will  be  long  term  or  short 
term.  
The  contribution  of  this  paper  is  threefold. 
First,  this  paper  addresses  research  needs  in  identities 
and  identifier  format  for  IoT.  Secondly,  this  paper  pre-
sent new identities and identifier format for devices with 
hierarchical  addressing.  Third,  result  of  comprehensive 
set of simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of clus-
tering  with  hierarchical  addressing  with  new  identifier 
format  is  presented  and  discussed.  Simulation  results 
show  better  performance  in  energy,  end-to-end  delay 
and throughput. CCHA simulation results are also com-
pared with existing solution for failure probability.  
 

This paper is structured as follows: First part of 
this  paper  focuses  on  related  works  in  the  field  of  IdM 
and  addressing  for  IoT  with  limitations.  Next  part  pre-
sents  proposed  CCHA  together  with  concept  of  identi-
ties,  identifiers  in  the  IoT,  and  identifier  format.  This 
paper  also  addresses  the  need  of  CCHA  for  IoT  things 
and  discusses  difference  between  flat  and  hierarchical 
addressing. Next section explains simulation results and 
discussion  together  with  the  mathematical  model  for 
queuing  analysis.  Finally  last  part  concludes  this  paper 
with discussion.  

RELATED WORKS 
 
Literature shows that there has been lot of  work for 
IdM  and  identities  but  none  of  the  work  addresses 
IoT.  Meaning of identity and design of identifier in 
the IoT context is one of the main issues in the view 
of resource constraints like energy, lifetime, end-to -
end delay, memory and routing overhead. Identity is 
whatever which makes the thing distinguishable and 
delineate.    Thing  under  consideration  only  has  one 
identity but  might be associated  with  many  identifi-
ers. These identifiers are  used to distinct  two things 
from each other and are context dependent. Different 
identity schemes have been proposed in the IoT and 
it  is  predicted  that  it  is  dubious  to  have  common 
identification  schemes  globally  [2].  Identification 
schemes  for  RFID  Object  Identifier,  EPCglobal, 
Short-OID  and  Near  Field  Communications  Forum 
have been studied in [2]. In [3], author addresses the 
IdM  problem  in  the  IoT  with  challenges  and 
roadmap and presents naming and addressing as one 
of the main issues for the IoT. New concept of virtu-
al  identities  for  the  IoT  is  presented  in  [4]  but  ad-
dressing  and  implementation  details  are  left  un-
addressed.  An  author  presents  the  domain  trusted 
entity  where  each  identity  is  managed  by  a  trusted 
entity  of  its  corresponding  home  domain  that  keeps 
it  under  the  preferences  set  by  its  holder.  This  ap-
proach  is  not  suitable  for  futuristic  IoT  due  to  its 
dynamic  topology  and  distributed  nature.  Use  of 
clustering  for  efficient  resource  management  in  the 
IoT is proposed in [5] achieving lifetime of network, 
scalability  and  reduced  packet  delay.  [6]  Proposes 
multi-hop  clustering  protocol  for  WSN  without  ad-
dressing  mobility.  There  have  been  many  attempts 
on  hierarchical  addressing  but  all  are  focusing  IP 
networks, Internet domain level in the current inter-
net  and  not  suitable  for  IoT  [7,  8,  and  9].  The  Do-
main  Name  System  (DNS)  is  a  hierarchical  naming 
system built on a distributed database for computers, 
services, or any resource connected to the Internet or 
a private network [10]. DNS is not suited for critical 
infrastructure and is prone to spoofing and authenti-
cation  problem.    Meanwhile,  the  Distributed  Hash 
Table  (DHT)  is  adopted  as  the  underlying  structure 
to  construct  the  basic  UID  management  methodolo-
gy [11]. Problems using DHT for IdM are achieving 
load  balancing  while  mapping  keys  to  nodes  and 
forwarding lookup for a key to appropriate node.  
 

Each thing in the IoT is always linked to some 
namespace. The notion of namespace here is much clos-
er to the notion of scenario or application under consid-
eration  as  well  as  context  in  which  things  operate  and 
provide  service.  Things  are  classified  into  two  types  as 
either things that are computers equipped with commu-
nication  interfaces  or  things  which  are  not  computers 
but  are  associated  with  computers  equipped  with  com-
munication interfaces. To this purpose, there is a need to

design  new  hierarchical  identifiers,  applying  hierar-
chical  addressing  by  grouping  the  objects  into  domains 
and clusters.  

PROPOSED NOVEL CONTEXT-AWARE 
CLUSTERING WITH HIRARCHICAL 
ADDRESSING (CCHA)  

Functionalities and operational principle of WSN makes 
it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the  IoT.  De-
vices  with  ubiquitous  and  wireless  communication  ca-
pabilities  are  attached  to  the  object  satisfying  the  need 
of IoT. Dynamic  network topology,  collaborative,  mul-
ti-hop communication and interactions of devices in all 
way  can  be  achieved  using  clustering  resulting  into 
scalability.  We define clustering as grouping of similar 
objects/devices or sensors in given context by achieving 
logical  organizing.  In  the  IoT,  this  paper  classifies 
things  into  three  types  as  people  (Users),  devices 
(Things)  and  information  (cloth,  medicine).  Depending 
on  the  context,  there  are  different  types  of  clustering 
like static, dynamic, single hop and multi hop, homoge-
nous and heterogeneous. This paper argues that cluster-
ing  reduces  the  number  of  devices  taking  part  in  trans-
mission  resulting  in  useful  energy  consumption;  scala-
bility  for  large  number  of  devices  and  also  reduces 
communication  overhead  for  single  hop  and  multi  hop 
communication  maintaining  namespaces.  Clustering 
algorithm can be classified as heuristic,  weighted, hier-
archical 
[12, 
13].Heuristic  algorithms  are  metrics  independent  algo-
rithms  and  gives  reasonable  performance  with  optimal 
solution. In heuristic  method  of clustering, cluster  head 
can  be  selected  depending  on  the  node  ID  or  neighbor 
also  can  be  selected  as  cluster  head.  In  weighted 
schemes,  weight  function  is  calculated  depending  on 
parameters  like  transmission  power,  mobility  and  ener-
gy of the node. This weighted function is used to select 
cluster head. In grid scheme, nodes are arranged in grid 
like structure and grid is built dynamically and random-
ly.  As  clustering  algorithm  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this 
paper,  we  use  normal  clustering  to  create  domain  and 
one  node  is  cluster  head  in  each  cluster.  Example  sce-
nario is shown in the Figure 1.

Use of hierarchical addressing is explained be-
low.  With  the  help  of  hierarchical  addressing,  we  can 
apply structure to identifiers such that left parts of iden-
tifier refer to individual block of network and right part 
refers  to  individual  node.  Advantages  of  hierarchical 
addressing  are  easy  manageability  with  optimized  per-
formance,  scalability  and  low  memory  and  bandwidth 
requirements.  Main  property  of  hierarchical  addressing 
is  that  it  support  aggregation  feature.  Aggregation  is  a 
summarization i.e.  grouping  of  many  identifiers  for  en-
hanced  routing  performance  and  stability.  Routing  is 
simplified by hierarchical addressing because sequences 
of steps are depending on individual  field. Hierarchical 
addresses  can  also  be  assigned  without  the  need  for  a 
central  authority  and  ellipsis  of  addresses  for  local 
namespace  use  is  easy.  Hierarchical  addresses  are  easy 
to change in case of mobility of devices in the IoT sub-
ject  to  efficient  use  of  address  space  and  suitable  con-
text dependent clustering.  Routing becomes complex in 
case  of  flat  addressing  as,  there  is  no  relationship  be-
tween actual address and the  naming  system. The  most 
famous addressing solution is Dynamic Host Configura-
tion  Protocol  (DHCP)  [14]  which  provides  configura-
tion  parameters  for  internet  host  and  is  based  on  client 
server model. In IoT, access to DHCP server for address 
assignment  cannot  be  guaranteed.  Distributed  Address 
Assignment (DAA) is presented in Zigbee Alliance [15] 
where  free  address  is  assigned  to  new  device  through 
association process. The probability that the device may 
fail to acquire an available address from its neighbors is 
more  in  DAA.  This  addressing  failure  occurs  due  to 
shortage of addresses or geographical location of devic-
es.  Pre-emptive  Distributed  Address  Assignment 
(PDAA) which is an automatic address assignment with 
unicity  is  presented  in  [16]  but  it  is  designed  for  fixed 
WSN. Due to this limitation, it is not possible to use this 
in  the  IoT.  Different  between  flat  and  hierarchical  ad-
dressing  based  on  different  parameters  is  given  in  the

A.  Proposed Identifier Format 

This section describes proposed  work  for identities and 
identities for IoT.  
 

a.  Identifiers in IoT 

An  identifier  discerns  different  users,  place  or 
thing  within 
the  context  of  specific  namespace. 
Namespace  plays  important  role  in  defining  identifier 
because  identifiers  are  always  local  to  the  current 
namespace.  For  example  user  and  sensor  both  have 
identifiers. User may be associated with bank, his office 
or  home.  Here  bank,  office  and  home  are  different 
namespaces  and  each  will  have  different  identifiers. 
Each identifier is meaningful in the namespace and only 
when  associated  with  thing  being  identified.  Example 
for CAR entity and its identifiers are shown in below.  

CAR =    {VIN, LICENCE PLATE, TYPE} 

 

CAR  has  three  identifiers  and  association  of 
CAR with one of the identifier is used depending on the 
context  and  the  namespace.  Precisely,  identifier  can  be 
defined in generic way as having three parameters as 
Identifier = {Thing, Identifier, Namespace} 

 
e.g.    {CAR  ,  VIN  ,  RTO_DB  }  ,  {  SENSOR  , 
NODE_ID , HOME_GATEWAY } , { TAG , EPCID 
, LOCAL_DB }  

 

 

Things  are  associated  with  many  identifiers 

and are show in the Figure 2.  

Fig. 2: Things and Identifiers in IoT 

 

 

An  attribute  is  dedicated  characteristic  associ-
ated with an entity like sensor node or object with RFID 
tag  in  the  IoT.  As  attributes  are  only  going  to  be  ex-
changed  for  association  with  an  identifiers,  meaningful 
attributes of things need to be defined for the IoT along 
with the scope rules. Attributes will vary from personal 
space  to  public  space.    Broadly,  there  are  two  types  of 
attributes  persistent  attribute  which  are  permanent  at-
tributes of thing and non-persistent attributes which are 
temporary attributes of things.  This paper proposes that 
each thing should be associated with at least one persis-
tent and one non-persistent attribute in the IoT. As both 
types of attribute will have different meaning in the lo-
cal context.  

b.  Identification and Identifier Format  

 

Association of identifier with thing presenting an attrib-
ute  is  called  as  identification.  For  example,  thing  is 
PDA  with  ID1,  this  example  includes  accepting  the  as-
sociation between thing PDA and its attribute as ID1. As 
discussed in above section, things can have many identi-
fiers and each identifier has to be associated with it de-
pending  on  the  context.  Identification  is  applicable  to 
both things and users and requires identifier. Things are 
always  acquiring  some  attributes  and  authentication  is 
referred  as  collection  of  proofs  for  attribute.  When 
things  communicate  with  each  other,  or  provide  any 
service,  they  always  provide  some  attribute  along  with 
identifier to authenticate. Identification is represented as 

{Thing identified, thing} ε Namespace 

 

IdM  is  set  of  processes  that  consist  of  identity 
binding,  identity  mapping  and  authentication.  It  in-
volves  management  and  exchange  of  thing  identity  in-
formation  also  known  as  digital  identity.  Precisely  we 
define IdM as management of identity followed by iden-
tity  authentication  and  attribute  authentication.  In  the 
IoT, each end point user, service or thing will be repre-
sented by an identity and identity is set of temporary or 
permanent  attributes  of  things.  Depending  on  the  con-
text  in  use,  the  separate  context  identity  (CID)  [17]  is 
used  with  the  help  of  domain  and  clustering  as  dis-
cussed  in  above  section.  In  order  to  support  context 
awareness and applying namespace dependent identifier 
to  thing,  utilization  of  context  information  is  important 
aspect. General definition of context is any information 
that can be used to classify the situation of an entity. An 
entity  is  a  person,  place,  or  object  that  is  considered 
relevant to the interaction between  a user and an appli-
cation. It is clear that such information is very important 
to  select  apply  appropriate  identifier  to  thing.  We  pro-
pose framework for IdM in the IoT in which IdM is one 
layer  with  the  set  of  processes  mentioned  above.  Con-
text management, identity binding, mapping and lifecy-
cle  management are key  milestones  which takes identi-
ties  and  credentials  as  an  input.  This  proposed  frame-
work is shown in the Figure 3.

Figure  4  shows  identifier  format  for  things  in 
the IoT. As discussed in above sections, nomadic things 
in  the  IoT  can  join  to  public  or  private  IoT.  In  this  re-
gards, it is essential to assign ownership to these things. 
As  things  can  be  people,  thing  or  information  and  this 
classification  must  be  present  as  one  the  parameter  in 
format. It should be easy to know the thing is RFID tag, 
sensor node, sensor network or PDA. For unique identi-
fication  purpose,  unique  identifiers  like  EUI-64  bit  of 
802.15.4,  EPC  code  [2]  or  any  other  unique  identifiers 
are associated with format. This format for thing should 
have  association  with  the  different  attributes  and  these 
attributes  are  decided on  the  namespace  in  which  thing 
is being used.

In  hierarchical 

The  purpose  of  simulation  is  to  observe  total 
energy  consumption,  end-to-end  delay  and  throughput 
for  flat  addressing  and  hierarchical  addressing  with 
clustering. 
addressing,  proposed 
identifier  format  is  applied  in  bit  string  format  and 
clustering  is  used  to  provide  the  namespaces.  This 
research  focuses  on  the  comparison  of  flat  addressing 
and  hierarchical  addressing  with  clustering  for  same 
simulation 
environment 
independent  of  underlying  MAC  and  routing  protocol. 
Objective  is  to  measure  the  performance  of  proposed 
type  of  hierarchical  identifiers  for  different  mobile 
nodes  under  different  flow  conditions.  Flow  condition 
represents single source– single destination and multiple 
source  –  multiple  destination  flow  for  mobile  nodes  as 
both types of flow could be  envisage in the IoT. Result 
of  different  simulation  scenario  is  discussed  below.  In 
clustering,  total  nodes  are  divided  into  five  different 
domains  to  create  different  namespaces  and  in  each 
domain two clusters are created with five nodes in each 
cluster.  These  clusters  are  communicating  with  each 
other through cluster head of one domain to cluster head 
of  other  domain.  For  simulation  purpose,  sample 
contexts are applied to different measurements.  
 

Figure 5 depicts the variation in end-to-end de-
lay for different rate for flat and hierarchical addressing. 
Nodes  are  organized  in  different  domains  and  in  each 
domain  consist  of  some  number  of  clusters  with  one 
cluster  head  per  each  cluster  and  simulation  parameter 
are kept same  for both  flat and hierarchical addressing. 
Simulation result in the Figure 5 shows that there is less 
end-to-end delay in CCHA for varying rate. 
 

Fig. 5: Rate and End-to-End-Delay 

 

 

Relation  between  rate  and  throughput  with 
varying rate for both the types of addressing is shown in 
figure 6. It depicts that, organizing devices into different 
namespaces  as  per  context  requirement  does  not  affect 
the throughput. A simulation result shows that through-
put  for  this  ad-hoc  network  is  same  in  flat  and  hierar-
chical  addressing.  In  case  of  clustering  the  devices,  as 
the  communication  is  happening  through  cluster  heads, 
there is no difference in throughput. This encourages the 
proposed  schemes  of  CCHA  in  the  IoT  because 
throughput  is  most  important  parameter  for  utilization

of  the  resource  constrained  IoT.  Lifetime  of  WSN 
which is excellent candidate for the IoT depends on the 
context in which it is being used. Expected lifetime has 
high  impact  on  the  energy  efficiency  and  robustness  of 
the  individual  devices  and  in  turn  the  network  as  a 
whole. Figure 7 show that clustering reduces the energy 
expenditure  and  thus  improve  the  scalability  and  ro-
bustness of device network in  the IoT. CCHA is useful 
for better improvement in parameters like energy, end to 
end delay, and throughput with scalability.

Abstract:  As  computing  technology  becomes  more 
tightly  coupled  into  dynamic  and  mobile  world  of  the 
Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  security  mechanism  becomes 
more  stringent,  less  flexible  and  intrusive.  Scalability 
issue  in  the  IoT  makes  Identity  Management  (IdM)  of 
ubiquitous  things  more  challenging.    Forming  ad-hoc 
network,  interaction  between  these  nomadic  devices  to 
provide seamless service extend the need of new identi-
ties  to  the  things,  addressing  and  IdM  in  the  IoT.  New 
identities  and  identifier  format  to  alleviate  the  perfor-
mance issue is introduced in this paper. This paper pre-
sents novel Context-aware Clustering  with Hierarchical 
Addressing  (CCHA)  scheme  for  the  things  with  new 
identifier  format.  Simulation  results  shows  that  CCHA 
achieves  better  performance  with  less  energy  expendi-
ture, less end-to-end delay and more throughput. Results 
also  show  that  CCHA  significantly  reduces  the  failure 
probability.    Furthermore,  this  paper  also  presents  the 
framework for IdM in  the IoT and mathematical model 
for queuing analysis.

ty Management, Internet of Things. 
 
INTRODUCTION 

The IoT is service-oriented architecture and is mandato-
ry subset of future Internet where every virtual or physi-
cal thing can communicate with every other thing giving 
seamless service to all stakeholders. The IoT is conver-
gence  of  sensors,  (Radio  Frequency  Identification) 
RFID, smart devices and anything with sensing, compu-
ting  and  communication  capability.  Devices  with  com-
munication  and  computation  capability  with  resource 
constraints  are  attached  to  the  things.  The  realistic  no-
tion of the IoT [1] has been seen with the development 
of technologies such as handheld objects, sensors, wire-
less  communication  and  mobile  Internet  access.  Seam-
less  communication  between  ubiquitous  things  in  the 
IoT  possesses  problems  of  addressing  and  IdM.  The 
greater scale and scope of the IoT increases the options 
in  which  a  user  can  interact  with  the  things  in  his/her 
physical and virtual environment. In this context, every-
day  things  are  globally  connected  and  managing  in-
creasing number of things requires scalable and efficient 
addressing  and  IdM  mechanism.  Due  to  increasing 
number  of  connected  things  in  the  IoT,  energy,  ubiqui-
tous  network  access,  secure  user  interaction  increases 
the  complexity  of  operation.  This  broader  scope  of  in-
teractions  enhances  the  need  to  extend  current  IdM 
models  to  include  new  hierarchical  identifiers  and  ad-
dressing based on clustering. Functionalities and opera-

 

1 

tional  principle  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN) 
makes  it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the 
IoT.  Mobility  of  these  devices,  dynamic  topology  and 
ad-hoc nature  must also be taken into consideration  for 
designing new identification and addressing schemes for 
IoT.  Things,  identities  and  the  interaction  of  the  things 
are  three  major  components  of  future  IoT  and  are  dis-
cussed below as:  

 

 

  Things include resource constrained sensors to 
object  with  RFID  rags.  The  IoT  of  future  will 
include  a  wide  array  of  devices  ranging  from 
high to low computing and communication ca-
pabilities and these things are always linked to 
some namespaces. 
Identities are the windows through which users 
interact with their things and consume services 
in today’s world. In the IoT world, this concept 
of  identity  extends  to  things  [2,  3].  Identities 
can  be  considered  as  end  points  so  that  it  is 
easy to ensure access to end point independent 
of thing being used like PDA or sensor.  
Interaction  which  is  ubiquitous  is  another  im-
portant challenge in the IoT. In the future, IoT 
users  will  be  able  to  discover  and  use  things 
that  are  public,  add  things  temporarily  to  their 
personal  space,  share  their  things  with  others, 
things that are public can be part of the person-
al space of multiple users at the same time, etc. 
and  this  association  will  be  long  term  or  short 
term.  
The  contribution  of  this  paper  is  threefold. 
First,  this  paper  addresses  research  needs  in  identities 
and  identifier  format  for  IoT.  Secondly,  this  paper  pre-
sent new identities and identifier format for devices with 
hierarchical  addressing.  Third,  result  of  comprehensive 
set of simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of clus-
tering  with  hierarchical  addressing  with  new  identifier 
format  is  presented  and  discussed.  Simulation  results 
show  better  performance  in  energy,  end-to-end  delay 
and throughput. CCHA simulation results are also com-
pared with existing solution for failure probability.  
 

This paper is structured as follows: First part of 
this  paper  focuses  on  related  works  in  the  field  of  IdM 
and  addressing  for  IoT  with  limitations.  Next  part  pre-
sents  proposed  CCHA  together  with  concept  of  identi-
ties,  identifiers  in  the  IoT,  and  identifier  format.  This 
paper  also  addresses  the  need  of  CCHA  for  IoT  things 
and  discusses  difference  between  flat  and  hierarchical 
addressing. Next section explains simulation results and 
discussion  together  with  the  mathematical  model  for 
queuing  analysis.  Finally  last  part  concludes  this  paper 
with discussion.  

RELATED WORKS 
 
Literature shows that there has been lot of  work for 
IdM  and  identities  but  none  of  the  work  addresses 
IoT.  Meaning of identity and design of identifier in 
the IoT context is one of the main issues in the view 
of resource constraints like energy, lifetime, end-to -
end delay, memory and routing overhead. Identity is 
whatever which makes the thing distinguishable and 
delineate.    Thing  under  consideration  only  has  one 
identity but  might be associated  with  many  identifi-
ers. These identifiers are  used to distinct  two things 
from each other and are context dependent. Different 
identity schemes have been proposed in the IoT and 
it  is  predicted  that  it  is  dubious  to  have  common 
identification  schemes  globally  [2].  Identification 
schemes  for  RFID  Object  Identifier,  EPCglobal, 
Short-OID  and  Near  Field  Communications  Forum 
have been studied in [2]. In [3], author addresses the 
IdM  problem  in  the  IoT  with  challenges  and 
roadmap and presents naming and addressing as one 
of the main issues for the IoT. New concept of virtu-
al  identities  for  the  IoT  is  presented  in  [4]  but  ad-
dressing  and  implementation  details  are  left  un-
addressed.  An  author  presents  the  domain  trusted 
entity  where  each  identity  is  managed  by  a  trusted 
entity  of  its  corresponding  home  domain  that  keeps 
it  under  the  preferences  set  by  its  holder.  This  ap-
proach  is  not  suitable  for  futuristic  IoT  due  to  its 
dynamic  topology  and  distributed  nature.  Use  of 
clustering  for  efficient  resource  management  in  the 
IoT is proposed in [5] achieving lifetime of network, 
scalability  and  reduced  packet  delay.  [6]  Proposes 
multi-hop  clustering  protocol  for  WSN  without  ad-
dressing  mobility.  There  have  been  many  attempts 
on  hierarchical  addressing  but  all  are  focusing  IP 
networks, Internet domain level in the current inter-
net  and  not  suitable  for  IoT  [7,  8,  and  9].  The  Do-
main  Name  System  (DNS)  is  a  hierarchical  naming 
system built on a distributed database for computers, 
services, or any resource connected to the Internet or 
a private network [10]. DNS is not suited for critical 
infrastructure and is prone to spoofing and authenti-
cation  problem.    Meanwhile,  the  Distributed  Hash 
Table  (DHT)  is  adopted  as  the  underlying  structure 
to  construct  the  basic  UID  management  methodolo-
gy [11]. Problems using DHT for IdM are achieving 
load  balancing  while  mapping  keys  to  nodes  and 
forwarding lookup for a key to appropriate node.  
 

Each thing in the IoT is always linked to some 
namespace. The notion of namespace here is much clos-
er to the notion of scenario or application under consid-
eration  as  well  as  context  in  which  things  operate  and 
provide  service.  Things  are  classified  into  two  types  as 
either things that are computers equipped with commu-
nication  interfaces  or  things  which  are  not  computers 
but  are  associated  with  computers  equipped  with  com-
munication interfaces. To this purpose, there is a need to

design  new  hierarchical  identifiers,  applying  hierar-
chical  addressing  by  grouping  the  objects  into  domains 
and clusters.  

PROPOSED NOVEL CONTEXT-AWARE 
CLUSTERING WITH HIRARCHICAL 
ADDRESSING (CCHA)  

Functionalities and operational principle of WSN makes 
it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the  IoT.  De-
vices  with  ubiquitous  and  wireless  communication  ca-
pabilities  are  attached  to  the  object  satisfying  the  need 
of IoT. Dynamic  network topology,  collaborative,  mul-
ti-hop communication and interactions of devices in all 
way  can  be  achieved  using  clustering  resulting  into 
scalability.  We define clustering as grouping of similar 
objects/devices or sensors in given context by achieving 
logical  organizing.  In  the  IoT,  this  paper  classifies 
things  into  three  types  as  people  (Users),  devices 
(Things)  and  information  (cloth,  medicine).  Depending 
on  the  context,  there  are  different  types  of  clustering 
like static, dynamic, single hop and multi hop, homoge-
nous and heterogeneous. This paper argues that cluster-
ing  reduces  the  number  of  devices  taking  part  in  trans-
mission  resulting  in  useful  energy  consumption;  scala-
bility  for  large  number  of  devices  and  also  reduces 
communication  overhead  for  single  hop  and  multi  hop 
communication  maintaining  namespaces.  Clustering 
algorithm can be classified as heuristic,  weighted, hier-
archical 
[12, 
13].Heuristic  algorithms  are  metrics  independent  algo-
rithms  and  gives  reasonable  performance  with  optimal 
solution. In heuristic  method  of clustering, cluster  head 
can  be  selected  depending  on  the  node  ID  or  neighbor 
also  can  be  selected  as  cluster  head.  In  weighted 
schemes,  weight  function  is  calculated  depending  on 
parameters  like  transmission  power,  mobility  and  ener-
gy of the node. This weighted function is used to select 
cluster head. In grid scheme, nodes are arranged in grid 
like structure and grid is built dynamically and random-
ly.  As  clustering  algorithm  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this 
paper,  we  use  normal  clustering  to  create  domain  and 
one  node  is  cluster  head  in  each  cluster.  Example  sce-
nario is shown in the Figure 1.

Use of hierarchical addressing is explained be-
low.  With  the  help  of  hierarchical  addressing,  we  can 
apply structure to identifiers such that left parts of iden-
tifier refer to individual block of network and right part 
refers  to  individual  node.  Advantages  of  hierarchical 
addressing  are  easy  manageability  with  optimized  per-
formance,  scalability  and  low  memory  and  bandwidth 
requirements.  Main  property  of  hierarchical  addressing 
is  that  it  support  aggregation  feature.  Aggregation  is  a 
summarization i.e.  grouping  of  many  identifiers  for  en-
hanced  routing  performance  and  stability.  Routing  is 
simplified by hierarchical addressing because sequences 
of steps are depending on individual  field. Hierarchical 
addresses  can  also  be  assigned  without  the  need  for  a 
central  authority  and  ellipsis  of  addresses  for  local 
namespace  use  is  easy.  Hierarchical  addresses  are  easy 
to change in case of mobility of devices in the IoT sub-
ject  to  efficient  use  of  address  space  and  suitable  con-
text dependent clustering.  Routing becomes complex in 
case  of  flat  addressing  as,  there  is  no  relationship  be-
tween actual address and the  naming  system. The  most 
famous addressing solution is Dynamic Host Configura-
tion  Protocol  (DHCP)  [14]  which  provides  configura-
tion  parameters  for  internet  host  and  is  based  on  client 
server model. In IoT, access to DHCP server for address 
assignment  cannot  be  guaranteed.  Distributed  Address 
Assignment (DAA) is presented in Zigbee Alliance [15] 
where  free  address  is  assigned  to  new  device  through 
association process. The probability that the device may 
fail to acquire an available address from its neighbors is 
more  in  DAA.  This  addressing  failure  occurs  due  to 
shortage of addresses or geographical location of devic-
es.  Pre-emptive  Distributed  Address  Assignment 
(PDAA) which is an automatic address assignment with 
unicity  is  presented  in  [16]  but  it  is  designed  for  fixed 
WSN. Due to this limitation, it is not possible to use this 
in  the  IoT.  Different  between  flat  and  hierarchical  ad-
dressing  based  on  different  parameters  is  given  in  the

A.  Proposed Identifier Format 

This section describes proposed  work  for identities and 
identities for IoT.  
 

a.  Identifiers in IoT 

An  identifier  discerns  different  users,  place  or 
thing  within 
the  context  of  specific  namespace. 
Namespace  plays  important  role  in  defining  identifier 
because  identifiers  are  always  local  to  the  current 
namespace.  For  example  user  and  sensor  both  have 
identifiers. User may be associated with bank, his office 
or  home.  Here  bank,  office  and  home  are  different 
namespaces  and  each  will  have  different  identifiers. 
Each identifier is meaningful in the namespace and only 
when  associated  with  thing  being  identified.  Example 
for CAR entity and its identifiers are shown in below.  

CAR =    {VIN, LICENCE PLATE, TYPE} 

 

CAR  has  three  identifiers  and  association  of 
CAR with one of the identifier is used depending on the 
context  and  the  namespace.  Precisely,  identifier  can  be 
defined in generic way as having three parameters as 
Identifier = {Thing, Identifier, Namespace} 

 
e.g.    {CAR  ,  VIN  ,  RTO_DB  }  ,  {  SENSOR  , 
NODE_ID , HOME_GATEWAY } , { TAG , EPCID 
, LOCAL_DB }  

 

 

Things  are  associated  with  many  identifiers 

and are show in the Figure 2.  

Fig. 2: Things and Identifiers in IoT 

 

 

An  attribute  is  dedicated  characteristic  associ-
ated with an entity like sensor node or object with RFID 
tag  in  the  IoT.  As  attributes  are  only  going  to  be  ex-
changed  for  association  with  an  identifiers,  meaningful 
attributes of things need to be defined for the IoT along 
with the scope rules. Attributes will vary from personal 
space  to  public  space.    Broadly,  there  are  two  types  of 
attributes  persistent  attribute  which  are  permanent  at-
tributes of thing and non-persistent attributes which are 
temporary attributes of things.  This paper proposes that 
each thing should be associated with at least one persis-
tent and one non-persistent attribute in the IoT. As both 
types of attribute will have different meaning in the lo-
cal context.  

b.  Identification and Identifier Format  

 

Association of identifier with thing presenting an attrib-
ute  is  called  as  identification.  For  example,  thing  is 
PDA  with  ID1,  this  example  includes  accepting  the  as-
sociation between thing PDA and its attribute as ID1. As 
discussed in above section, things can have many identi-
fiers and each identifier has to be associated with it de-
pending  on  the  context.  Identification  is  applicable  to 
both things and users and requires identifier. Things are 
always  acquiring  some  attributes  and  authentication  is 
referred  as  collection  of  proofs  for  attribute.  When 
things  communicate  with  each  other,  or  provide  any 
service,  they  always  provide  some  attribute  along  with 
identifier to authenticate. Identification is represented as 

{Thing identified, thing} ε Namespace 

 

IdM  is  set  of  processes  that  consist  of  identity 
binding,  identity  mapping  and  authentication.  It  in-
volves  management  and  exchange  of  thing  identity  in-
formation  also  known  as  digital  identity.  Precisely  we 
define IdM as management of identity followed by iden-
tity  authentication  and  attribute  authentication.  In  the 
IoT, each end point user, service or thing will be repre-
sented by an identity and identity is set of temporary or 
permanent  attributes  of  things.  Depending  on  the  con-
text  in  use,  the  separate  context  identity  (CID)  [17]  is 
used  with  the  help  of  domain  and  clustering  as  dis-
cussed  in  above  section.  In  order  to  support  context 
awareness and applying namespace dependent identifier 
to  thing,  utilization  of  context  information  is  important 
aspect. General definition of context is any information 
that can be used to classify the situation of an entity. An 
entity  is  a  person,  place,  or  object  that  is  considered 
relevant to the interaction between  a user and an appli-
cation. It is clear that such information is very important 
to  select  apply  appropriate  identifier  to  thing.  We  pro-
pose framework for IdM in the IoT in which IdM is one 
layer  with  the  set  of  processes  mentioned  above.  Con-
text management, identity binding, mapping and lifecy-
cle  management are key  milestones  which takes identi-
ties  and  credentials  as  an  input.  This  proposed  frame-
work is shown in the Figure 3.

Figure  4  shows  identifier  format  for  things  in 
the IoT. As discussed in above sections, nomadic things 
in  the  IoT  can  join  to  public  or  private  IoT.  In  this  re-
gards, it is essential to assign ownership to these things. 
As  things  can  be  people,  thing  or  information  and  this 
classification  must  be  present  as  one  the  parameter  in 
format. It should be easy to know the thing is RFID tag, 
sensor node, sensor network or PDA. For unique identi-
fication  purpose,  unique  identifiers  like  EUI-64  bit  of 
802.15.4,  EPC  code  [2]  or  any  other  unique  identifiers 
are associated with format. This format for thing should 
have  association  with  the  different  attributes  and  these 
attributes  are  decided on  the  namespace  in  which  thing 
is being used.

a.  Simulation Results  

Simulation  is  carried  out  to  measure  the  fol-

lowing three sets of parameters: 

 

  Energy , end-to-end delay and throughput 

parameter 

in  mobile 

In  hierarchical 

The  purpose  of  simulation  is  to  observe  total 
energy  consumption,  end-to-end  delay  and  throughput 
for  flat  addressing  and  hierarchical  addressing  with 
clustering. 
addressing,  proposed 
identifier  format  is  applied  in  bit  string  format  and 
clustering  is  used  to  provide  the  namespaces.  This 
research  focuses  on  the  comparison  of  flat  addressing 
and  hierarchical  addressing  with  clustering  for  same 
simulation 
environment 
independent  of  underlying  MAC  and  routing  protocol. 
Objective  is  to  measure  the  performance  of  proposed 
type  of  hierarchical  identifiers  for  different  mobile 
nodes  under  different  flow  conditions.  Flow  condition 
represents single source– single destination and multiple 
source  –  multiple  destination  flow  for  mobile  nodes  as 
both types of flow could be  envisage in the IoT. Result 
of  different  simulation  scenario  is  discussed  below.  In 
clustering,  total  nodes  are  divided  into  five  different 
domains  to  create  different  namespaces  and  in  each 
domain two clusters are created with five nodes in each 
cluster.  These  clusters  are  communicating  with  each 
other through cluster head of one domain to cluster head 
of  other  domain.  For  simulation  purpose,  sample 
contexts are applied to different measurements.  
 

Figure 5 depicts the variation in end-to-end de-
lay for different rate for flat and hierarchical addressing. 
Nodes  are  organized  in  different  domains  and  in  each 
domain  consist  of  some  number  of  clusters  with  one 
cluster  head  per  each  cluster  and  simulation  parameter 
are kept same  for both  flat and hierarchical addressing. 
Simulation result in the Figure 5 shows that there is less 
end-to-end delay in CCHA for varying rate. 
 

Fig. 5: Rate and End-to-End-Delay 

 

 

Relation  between  rate  and  throughput  with 
varying rate for both the types of addressing is shown in 
figure 6. It depicts that, organizing devices into different 
namespaces  as  per  context  requirement  does  not  affect 
the throughput. A simulation result shows that through-
put  for  this  ad-hoc  network  is  same  in  flat  and  hierar-
chical  addressing.  In  case  of  clustering  the  devices,  as 
the  communication  is  happening  through  cluster  heads, 
there is no difference in throughput. This encourages the 
proposed  schemes  of  CCHA  in  the  IoT  because 
throughput  is  most  important  parameter  for  utilization

of  the  resource  constrained  IoT.  Lifetime  of  WSN 
which is excellent candidate for the IoT depends on the 
context in which it is being used. Expected lifetime has 
high  impact  on  the  energy  efficiency  and  robustness  of 
the  individual  devices  and  in  turn  the  network  as  a 
whole. Figure 7 show that clustering reduces the energy 
expenditure  and  thus  improve  the  scalability  and  ro-
bustness of device network in  the IoT. CCHA is useful 
for better improvement in parameters like energy, end to 
end delay, and throughput with scalability.

The effectiveness of proposed scheme in terms 
of  addressing  failure  is  verified  using  simulation.  1000

lated where N ranges from 100 to 1000 and the commu-
nication range of all devices is fixed. Address length is

The total service  time comprises of two  factors, expec-

kept constant as 16 bit. Figure 8 shows the failure prob-
ability  versus the  number of  devices in IoT for address 
length  16.  Figure  compares  the  failure  probability  of 
DAA,  PDAA  and  CCHA.  Figure  8  show  that  CCHA 
scheme  encounters  fewer  addressing  failures  as  com-
pared  to  DAA  and  PDAA  for  different  number  of  de-
vices in IoT. This proves that, in CCHA scheme, devic-
es are more like to associate than others hence making it 
scalable and energy efficient in nature. 
 

a.  Mathematical Model 

The proposed CCHA model consists of a cluster head or 
gateway  party  referred  as  Identifier  Allocator  (IA) 
which  is  responsible  for  context-aware  hierarchical  ad-
dress  assignment  to  the  devices  joining  the  IoT  net-
works. Devices approaching IA for identifiers are man-
aged  in  queue.  Figure  9  shows  the  system,  where     is 
the  arrival  rate  of  devices.  The  inter-arrival  time  for 
devices  is  exponentially  distributed.  Thus  arrival  rate 
follows  the  poisons  arrival  process.  Proposed  CCHA 
system  can  be  modelled  with  M/D/1  queuing  model 
with  constant  service  rate  and  one  server.  To  evaluate 
the system performance, we model the sojourn time that 
is total time spend by the device in the system.

The expectation of waiting time for devices in the queue 
can be given in equation (1) as, 
 [  ]           [ ]    [ ]                                       (1) 
Where,     = mean number of devices in queue                         
 [ ] = service time of IA   
 [ ] = residual time 
 
Thus  by  Llittle’s  formula  [19],  mean  queue  length  is 
given equation (2) as, 
           [  ]                                                            (2) 
Therefore,  [  ]    
 
Where,  utilization of IA is given as,             [ ] 
The  residual  time,      is  the  service  time  remaining  to 
the  device  being  served  when  the      device  arrives  at 
queue. Mean residual time can be calculated by dividing 
sum of areas of triangles by the length of interval and is 
derived in equation (3).

Thus, from equations (1) to (7), it can be con-
cluded that the total time spent by a device in system is 
function  of  the  service  time   [ ] and  utilization  of  IA, 
   .  The  mean  queue  length  and  utilization  are  propor-
tional  to  each  other.  If  number  of  devices  in  queue  in-
creases the utilization of IA also increases [18]. 
 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
 
IdM  and  addressing  of  ubiquitous  things  is  one  of  the 
main issues in resource constrained IoT. To solve ensu-
ing problem, this paper has proposed concept of identi-
ty,  identification  and  identifier  format.  It  also  proposes 
novel and efficient CCHA for nomadic things in the IoT 
and  clustering  of  ubiquitous  things  to  achieve  lifetime, 
scalability  and  robustness.  In  CCHA,  context  is  inte-
grated together with clustering and hierarchical address-
ing  for  proposed  identifier  format.  Simulation  results 
show  that  how  CCHA  is  beneficial  to  create  different 
namespaces and results into better performance in terms 
of end-to-end delay, throughput and energy expenditure 
of the network. Paper compares the results with existing 
flat  addressing  in  terms  of  aforementioned  parameters 
and  concludes  that  for  effective  IdM  in  the  IoT,  pro-
posed  identifier  format  together  with  context-aware 
clustering  for  hierarchical  addressing  is  better  choice. 
Simulation  results  also  shows  that  CCHA  is  less  prone

Abstract:  As  computing  technology  becomes  more 
tightly  coupled  into  dynamic  and  mobile  world  of  the 
Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  security  mechanism  becomes 
more  stringent,  less  flexible  and  intrusive.  Scalability 
issue  in  the  IoT  makes  Identity  Management  (IdM)  of 
ubiquitous  things  more  challenging.    Forming  ad-hoc 
network,  interaction  between  these  nomadic  devices  to 
provide seamless service extend the need of new identi-
ties  to  the  things,  addressing  and  IdM  in  the  IoT.  New 
identities  and  identifier  format  to  alleviate  the  perfor-
mance issue is introduced in this paper. This paper pre-
sents novel Context-aware Clustering  with Hierarchical 
Addressing  (CCHA)  scheme  for  the  things  with  new 
identifier  format.  Simulation  results  shows  that  CCHA 
achieves  better  performance  with  less  energy  expendi-
ture, less end-to-end delay and more throughput. Results 
also  show  that  CCHA  significantly  reduces  the  failure 
probability.    Furthermore,  this  paper  also  presents  the 
framework for IdM in  the IoT and mathematical model 
for queuing analysis.

ty Management, Internet of Things. 
 
INTRODUCTION 

The IoT is service-oriented architecture and is mandato-
ry subset of future Internet where every virtual or physi-
cal thing can communicate with every other thing giving 
seamless service to all stakeholders. The IoT is conver-
gence  of  sensors,  (Radio  Frequency  Identification) 
RFID, smart devices and anything with sensing, compu-
ting  and  communication  capability.  Devices  with  com-
munication  and  computation  capability  with  resource 
constraints  are  attached  to  the  things.  The  realistic  no-
tion of the IoT [1] has been seen with the development 
of technologies such as handheld objects, sensors, wire-
less  communication  and  mobile  Internet  access.  Seam-
less  communication  between  ubiquitous  things  in  the 
IoT  possesses  problems  of  addressing  and  IdM.  The 
greater scale and scope of the IoT increases the options 
in  which  a  user  can  interact  with  the  things  in  his/her 
physical and virtual environment. In this context, every-
day  things  are  globally  connected  and  managing  in-
creasing number of things requires scalable and efficient 
addressing  and  IdM  mechanism.  Due  to  increasing 
number  of  connected  things  in  the  IoT,  energy,  ubiqui-
tous  network  access,  secure  user  interaction  increases 
the  complexity  of  operation.  This  broader  scope  of  in-
teractions  enhances  the  need  to  extend  current  IdM 
models  to  include  new  hierarchical  identifiers  and  ad-
dressing based on clustering. Functionalities and opera-

 

1 

tional  principle  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN) 
makes  it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the 
IoT.  Mobility  of  these  devices,  dynamic  topology  and 
ad-hoc nature  must also be taken into consideration  for 
designing new identification and addressing schemes for 
IoT.  Things,  identities  and  the  interaction  of  the  things 
are  three  major  components  of  future  IoT  and  are  dis-
cussed below as:  

 

 

  Things include resource constrained sensors to 
object  with  RFID  rags.  The  IoT  of  future  will 
include  a  wide  array  of  devices  ranging  from 
high to low computing and communication ca-
pabilities and these things are always linked to 
some namespaces. 
Identities are the windows through which users 
interact with their things and consume services 
in today’s world. In the IoT world, this concept 
of  identity  extends  to  things  [2,  3].  Identities 
can  be  considered  as  end  points  so  that  it  is 
easy to ensure access to end point independent 
of thing being used like PDA or sensor.  
Interaction  which  is  ubiquitous  is  another  im-
portant challenge in the IoT. In the future, IoT 
users  will  be  able  to  discover  and  use  things 
that  are  public,  add  things  temporarily  to  their 
personal  space,  share  their  things  with  others, 
things that are public can be part of the person-
al space of multiple users at the same time, etc. 
and  this  association  will  be  long  term  or  short 
term.  
The  contribution  of  this  paper  is  threefold. 
First,  this  paper  addresses  research  needs  in  identities 
and  identifier  format  for  IoT.  Secondly,  this  paper  pre-
sent new identities and identifier format for devices with 
hierarchical  addressing.  Third,  result  of  comprehensive 
set of simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of clus-
tering  with  hierarchical  addressing  with  new  identifier 
format  is  presented  and  discussed.  Simulation  results 
show  better  performance  in  energy,  end-to-end  delay 
and throughput. CCHA simulation results are also com-
pared with existing solution for failure probability.  
 

This paper is structured as follows: First part of 
this  paper  focuses  on  related  works  in  the  field  of  IdM 
and  addressing  for  IoT  with  limitations.  Next  part  pre-
sents  proposed  CCHA  together  with  concept  of  identi-
ties,  identifiers  in  the  IoT,  and  identifier  format.  This 
paper  also  addresses  the  need  of  CCHA  for  IoT  things 
and  discusses  difference  between  flat  and  hierarchical 
addressing. Next section explains simulation results and 
discussion  together  with  the  mathematical  model  for 
queuing  analysis.  Finally  last  part  concludes  this  paper 
with discussion.  

RELATED WORKS 
 
Literature shows that there has been lot of  work for 
IdM  and  identities  but  none  of  the  work  addresses 
IoT.  Meaning of identity and design of identifier in 
the IoT context is one of the main issues in the view 
of resource constraints like energy, lifetime, end-to -
end delay, memory and routing overhead. Identity is 
whatever which makes the thing distinguishable and 
delineate.    Thing  under  consideration  only  has  one 
identity but  might be associated  with  many  identifi-
ers. These identifiers are  used to distinct  two things 
from each other and are context dependent. Different 
identity schemes have been proposed in the IoT and 
it  is  predicted  that  it  is  dubious  to  have  common 
identification  schemes  globally  [2].  Identification 
schemes  for  RFID  Object  Identifier,  EPCglobal, 
Short-OID  and  Near  Field  Communications  Forum 
have been studied in [2]. In [3], author addresses the 
IdM  problem  in  the  IoT  with  challenges  and 
roadmap and presents naming and addressing as one 
of the main issues for the IoT. New concept of virtu-
al  identities  for  the  IoT  is  presented  in  [4]  but  ad-
dressing  and  implementation  details  are  left  un-
addressed.  An  author  presents  the  domain  trusted 
entity  where  each  identity  is  managed  by  a  trusted 
entity  of  its  corresponding  home  domain  that  keeps 
it  under  the  preferences  set  by  its  holder.  This  ap-
proach  is  not  suitable  for  futuristic  IoT  due  to  its 
dynamic  topology  and  distributed  nature.  Use  of 
clustering  for  efficient  resource  management  in  the 
IoT is proposed in [5] achieving lifetime of network, 
scalability  and  reduced  packet  delay.  [6]  Proposes 
multi-hop  clustering  protocol  for  WSN  without  ad-
dressing  mobility.  There  have  been  many  attempts 
on  hierarchical  addressing  but  all  are  focusing  IP 
networks, Internet domain level in the current inter-
net  and  not  suitable  for  IoT  [7,  8,  and  9].  The  Do-
main  Name  System  (DNS)  is  a  hierarchical  naming 
system built on a distributed database for computers, 
services, or any resource connected to the Internet or 
a private network [10]. DNS is not suited for critical 
infrastructure and is prone to spoofing and authenti-
cation  problem.    Meanwhile,  the  Distributed  Hash 
Table  (DHT)  is  adopted  as  the  underlying  structure 
to  construct  the  basic  UID  management  methodolo-
gy [11]. Problems using DHT for IdM are achieving 
load  balancing  while  mapping  keys  to  nodes  and 
forwarding lookup for a key to appropriate node.  
 

Each thing in the IoT is always linked to some 
namespace. The notion of namespace here is much clos-
er to the notion of scenario or application under consid-
eration  as  well  as  context  in  which  things  operate  and 
provide  service.  Things  are  classified  into  two  types  as 
either things that are computers equipped with commu-
nication  interfaces  or  things  which  are  not  computers 
but  are  associated  with  computers  equipped  with  com-
munication interfaces. To this purpose, there is a need to

design  new  hierarchical  identifiers,  applying  hierar-
chical  addressing  by  grouping  the  objects  into  domains 
and clusters.  

PROPOSED NOVEL CONTEXT-AWARE 
CLUSTERING WITH HIRARCHICAL 
ADDRESSING (CCHA)  

Functionalities and operational principle of WSN makes 
it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the  IoT.  De-
vices  with  ubiquitous  and  wireless  communication  ca-
pabilities  are  attached  to  the  object  satisfying  the  need 
of IoT. Dynamic  network topology,  collaborative,  mul-
ti-hop communication and interactions of devices in all 
way  can  be  achieved  using  clustering  resulting  into 
scalability.  We define clustering as grouping of similar 
objects/devices or sensors in given context by achieving 
logical  organizing.  In  the  IoT,  this  paper  classifies 
things  into  three  types  as  people  (Users),  devices 
(Things)  and  information  (cloth,  medicine).  Depending 
on  the  context,  there  are  different  types  of  clustering 
like static, dynamic, single hop and multi hop, homoge-
nous and heterogeneous. This paper argues that cluster-
ing  reduces  the  number  of  devices  taking  part  in  trans-
mission  resulting  in  useful  energy  consumption;  scala-
bility  for  large  number  of  devices  and  also  reduces 
communication  overhead  for  single  hop  and  multi  hop 
communication  maintaining  namespaces.  Clustering 
algorithm can be classified as heuristic,  weighted, hier-
archical 
[12, 
13].Heuristic  algorithms  are  metrics  independent  algo-
rithms  and  gives  reasonable  performance  with  optimal 
solution. In heuristic  method  of clustering, cluster  head 
can  be  selected  depending  on  the  node  ID  or  neighbor 
also  can  be  selected  as  cluster  head.  In  weighted 
schemes,  weight  function  is  calculated  depending  on 
parameters  like  transmission  power,  mobility  and  ener-
gy of the node. This weighted function is used to select 
cluster head. In grid scheme, nodes are arranged in grid 
like structure and grid is built dynamically and random-
ly.  As  clustering  algorithm  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this 
paper,  we  use  normal  clustering  to  create  domain  and 
one  node  is  cluster  head  in  each  cluster.  Example  sce-
nario is shown in the Figure 1.

Use of hierarchical addressing is explained be-
low.  With  the  help  of  hierarchical  addressing,  we  can 
apply structure to identifiers such that left parts of iden-
tifier refer to individual block of network and right part 
refers  to  individual  node.  Advantages  of  hierarchical 
addressing  are  easy  manageability  with  optimized  per-
formance,  scalability  and  low  memory  and  bandwidth 
requirements.  Main  property  of  hierarchical  addressing 
is  that  it  support  aggregation  feature.  Aggregation  is  a 
summarization i.e.  grouping  of  many  identifiers  for  en-
hanced  routing  performance  and  stability.  Routing  is 
simplified by hierarchical addressing because sequences 
of steps are depending on individual  field. Hierarchical 
addresses  can  also  be  assigned  without  the  need  for  a 
central  authority  and  ellipsis  of  addresses  for  local 
namespace  use  is  easy.  Hierarchical  addresses  are  easy 
to change in case of mobility of devices in the IoT sub-
ject  to  efficient  use  of  address  space  and  suitable  con-
text dependent clustering.  Routing becomes complex in 
case  of  flat  addressing  as,  there  is  no  relationship  be-
tween actual address and the  naming  system. The  most 
famous addressing solution is Dynamic Host Configura-
tion  Protocol  (DHCP)  [14]  which  provides  configura-
tion  parameters  for  internet  host  and  is  based  on  client 
server model. In IoT, access to DHCP server for address 
assignment  cannot  be  guaranteed.  Distributed  Address 
Assignment (DAA) is presented in Zigbee Alliance [15] 
where  free  address  is  assigned  to  new  device  through 
association process. The probability that the device may 
fail to acquire an available address from its neighbors is 
more  in  DAA.  This  addressing  failure  occurs  due  to 
shortage of addresses or geographical location of devic-
es.  Pre-emptive  Distributed  Address  Assignment 
(PDAA) which is an automatic address assignment with 
unicity  is  presented  in  [16]  but  it  is  designed  for  fixed 
WSN. Due to this limitation, it is not possible to use this 
in  the  IoT.  Different  between  flat  and  hierarchical  ad-
dressing  based  on  different  parameters  is  given  in  the

A.  Proposed Identifier Format 

This section describes proposed  work  for identities and 
identities for IoT.  
 

a.  Identifiers in IoT 

An  identifier  discerns  different  users,  place  or 
thing  within 
the  context  of  specific  namespace. 
Namespace  plays  important  role  in  defining  identifier 
because  identifiers  are  always  local  to  the  current 
namespace.  For  example  user  and  sensor  both  have 
identifiers. User may be associated with bank, his office 
or  home.  Here  bank,  office  and  home  are  different 
namespaces  and  each  will  have  different  identifiers. 
Each identifier is meaningful in the namespace and only 
when  associated  with  thing  being  identified.  Example 
for CAR entity and its identifiers are shown in below.  

CAR =    {VIN, LICENCE PLATE, TYPE} 

 

CAR  has  three  identifiers  and  association  of 
CAR with one of the identifier is used depending on the 
context  and  the  namespace.  Precisely,  identifier  can  be 
defined in generic way as having three parameters as 
Identifier = {Thing, Identifier, Namespace} 

 
e.g.    {CAR  ,  VIN  ,  RTO_DB  }  ,  {  SENSOR  , 
NODE_ID , HOME_GATEWAY } , { TAG , EPCID 
, LOCAL_DB }  

 

 

Things  are  associated  with  many  identifiers 

and are show in the Figure 2.  

Fig. 2: Things and Identifiers in IoT 

 

 

An  attribute  is  dedicated  characteristic  associ-
ated with an entity like sensor node or object with RFID 
tag  in  the  IoT.  As  attributes  are  only  going  to  be  ex-
changed  for  association  with  an  identifiers,  meaningful 
attributes of things need to be defined for the IoT along 
with the scope rules. Attributes will vary from personal 
space  to  public  space.    Broadly,  there  are  two  types  of 
attributes  persistent  attribute  which  are  permanent  at-
tributes of thing and non-persistent attributes which are 
temporary attributes of things.  This paper proposes that 
each thing should be associated with at least one persis-
tent and one non-persistent attribute in the IoT. As both 
types of attribute will have different meaning in the lo-
cal context.  

b.  Identification and Identifier Format  

 

Association of identifier with thing presenting an attrib-
ute  is  called  as  identification.  For  example,  thing  is 
PDA  with  ID1,  this  example  includes  accepting  the  as-
sociation between thing PDA and its attribute as ID1. As 
discussed in above section, things can have many identi-
fiers and each identifier has to be associated with it de-
pending  on  the  context.  Identification  is  applicable  to 
both things and users and requires identifier. Things are 
always  acquiring  some  attributes  and  authentication  is 
referred  as  collection  of  proofs  for  attribute.  When 
things  communicate  with  each  other,  or  provide  any 
service,  they  always  provide  some  attribute  along  with 
identifier to authenticate. Identification is represented as 

{Thing identified, thing} ε Namespace 

 

IdM  is  set  of  processes  that  consist  of  identity 
binding,  identity  mapping  and  authentication.  It  in-
volves  management  and  exchange  of  thing  identity  in-
formation  also  known  as  digital  identity.  Precisely  we 
define IdM as management of identity followed by iden-
tity  authentication  and  attribute  authentication.  In  the 
IoT, each end point user, service or thing will be repre-
sented by an identity and identity is set of temporary or 
permanent  attributes  of  things.  Depending  on  the  con-
text  in  use,  the  separate  context  identity  (CID)  [17]  is 
used  with  the  help  of  domain  and  clustering  as  dis-
cussed  in  above  section.  In  order  to  support  context 
awareness and applying namespace dependent identifier 
to  thing,  utilization  of  context  information  is  important 
aspect. General definition of context is any information 
that can be used to classify the situation of an entity. An 
entity  is  a  person,  place,  or  object  that  is  considered 
relevant to the interaction between  a user and an appli-
cation. It is clear that such information is very important 
to  select  apply  appropriate  identifier  to  thing.  We  pro-
pose framework for IdM in the IoT in which IdM is one 
layer  with  the  set  of  processes  mentioned  above.  Con-
text management, identity binding, mapping and lifecy-
cle  management are key  milestones  which takes identi-
ties  and  credentials  as  an  input.  This  proposed  frame-
work is shown in the Figure 3.  
 

Fig. 3: Proposed Framework for IdM in the IoT

Figure  4  shows  identifier  format  for  things  in 
the IoT. As discussed in above sections, nomadic things 
in  the  IoT  can  join  to  public  or  private  IoT.  In  this  re-
gards, it is essential to assign ownership to these things. 
As  things  can  be  people,  thing  or  information  and  this 
classification  must  be  present  as  one  the  parameter  in 
format. It should be easy to know the thing is RFID tag, 
sensor node, sensor network or PDA. For unique identi-
fication  purpose,  unique  identifiers  like  EUI-64  bit  of 
802.15.4,  EPC  code  [2]  or  any  other  unique  identifiers 
are associated with format. This format for thing should 
have  association  with  the  different  attributes  and  these 
attributes  are  decided on  the  namespace  in  which  thing 
is being used.

a.  Simulation Results  

Simulation  is  carried  out  to  measure  the  fol-

lowing three sets of parameters: 

 

  Energy , end-to-end delay and throughput 

parameter 

in  mobile 

In  hierarchical 

The  purpose  of  simulation  is  to  observe  total 
energy  consumption,  end-to-end  delay  and  throughput 
for  flat  addressing  and  hierarchical  addressing  with 
clustering. 
addressing,  proposed 
identifier  format  is  applied  in  bit  string  format  and 
clustering  is  used  to  provide  the  namespaces.  This 
research  focuses  on  the  comparison  of  flat  addressing 
and  hierarchical  addressing  with  clustering  for  same 
simulation 
environment 
independent  of  underlying  MAC  and  routing  protocol. 
Objective  is  to  measure  the  performance  of  proposed 
type  of  hierarchical  identifiers  for  different  mobile 
nodes  under  different  flow  conditions.  Flow  condition 
represents single source– single destination and multiple 
source  –  multiple  destination  flow  for  mobile  nodes  as 
both types of flow could be  envisage in the IoT. Result 
of  different  simulation  scenario  is  discussed  below.  In 
clustering,  total  nodes  are  divided  into  five  different 
domains  to  create  different  namespaces  and  in  each 
domain two clusters are created with five nodes in each 
cluster.  These  clusters  are  communicating  with  each 
other through cluster head of one domain to cluster head 
of  other  domain.  For  simulation  purpose,  sample 
contexts are applied to different measurements.  
 

Figure 5 depicts the variation in end-to-end de-
lay for different rate for flat and hierarchical addressing. 
Nodes  are  organized  in  different  domains  and  in  each 
domain  consist  of  some  number  of  clusters  with  one 
cluster  head  per  each  cluster  and  simulation  parameter 
are kept same  for both  flat and hierarchical addressing. 
Simulation result in the Figure 5 shows that there is less 
end-to-end delay in CCHA for varying rate. 
 

Fig. 5: Rate and End-to-End-Delay 

 

 

Relation  between  rate  and  throughput  with 
varying rate for both the types of addressing is shown in 
figure 6. It depicts that, organizing devices into different 
namespaces  as  per  context  requirement  does  not  affect 
the throughput. A simulation result shows that through-
put  for  this  ad-hoc  network  is  same  in  flat  and  hierar-
chical  addressing.  In  case  of  clustering  the  devices,  as 
the  communication  is  happening  through  cluster  heads, 
there is no difference in throughput. This encourages the 
proposed  schemes  of  CCHA  in  the  IoT  because 
throughput  is  most  important  parameter  for  utilization

of  the  resource  constrained  IoT.  Lifetime  of  WSN 
which is excellent candidate for the IoT depends on the 
context in which it is being used. Expected lifetime has 
high  impact  on  the  energy  efficiency  and  robustness  of 
the  individual  devices  and  in  turn  the  network  as  a 
whole. Figure 7 show that clustering reduces the energy 
expenditure  and  thus  improve  the  scalability  and  ro-
bustness of device network in  the IoT. CCHA is useful 
for better improvement in parameters like energy, end to 
end delay, and throughput with scalability.

nication range of all devices is fixed. Address length is

The total service  time comprises of two  factors, expec-

square  of  mean  of  values.  Therefore  V[S]  is  given  by

kept constant as 16 bit. Figure 8 shows the failure prob-
ability  versus the  number of  devices in IoT for address 
length  16.  Figure  compares  the  failure  probability  of 
DAA,  PDAA  and  CCHA.  Figure  8  show  that  CCHA 
scheme  encounters  fewer  addressing  failures  as  com-
pared  to  DAA  and  PDAA  for  different  number  of  de-
vices in IoT. This proves that, in CCHA scheme, devic-
es are more like to associate than others hence making it 
scalable and energy efficient in nature. 
 

a.  Mathematical Model 

The proposed CCHA model consists of a cluster head or 
gateway  party  referred  as  Identifier  Allocator  (IA) 
which  is  responsible  for  context-aware  hierarchical  ad-
dress  assignment  to  the  devices  joining  the  IoT  net-
works. Devices approaching IA for identifiers are man-
aged  in  queue.  Figure  9  shows  the  system,  where     is 
the  arrival  rate  of  devices.  The  inter-arrival  time  for 
devices  is  exponentially  distributed.  Thus  arrival  rate 
follows  the  poisons  arrival  process.  Proposed  CCHA 
system  can  be  modelled  with  M/D/1  queuing  model 
with  constant  service  rate  and  one  server.  To  evaluate 
the system performance, we model the sojourn time that 
is total time spend by the device in the system. 

 

Fig.9: CCHA Queuing Model [18] 

 

 

       

 

   

 (     )
 

 

 

 

The expectation of waiting time for devices in the queue 
can be given in equation (1) as, 
 [  ]           [ ]    [ ]                                       (1) 
Where,     = mean number of devices in queue                         
 [ ] = service time of IA   
 [ ] = residual time 
 
Thus  by  Llittle’s  formula  [19],  mean  queue  length  is 
given equation (2) as, 
           [  ]                                                            (2) 
Therefore,  [  ]    
 
Where,  utilization of IA is given as,             [ ] 
The  residual  time,      is  the  service  time  remaining  to 
the  device  being  served  when  the      device  arrives  at 
queue. Mean residual time can be calculated by dividing 
sum of areas of triangles by the length of interval and is 
derived in equation (3).

Thus, from equations (1) to (7), it can be con-
cluded that the total time spent by a device in system is 
function  of  the  service  time   [ ] and  utilization  of  IA, 
   .  The  mean  queue  length  and  utilization  are  propor-
tional  to  each  other.  If  number  of  devices  in  queue  in-
creases the utilization of IA also increases [18]. 
 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
 
IdM  and  addressing  of  ubiquitous  things  is  one  of  the 
main issues in resource constrained IoT. To solve ensu-
ing problem, this paper has proposed concept of identi-
ty,  identification  and  identifier  format.  It  also  proposes 
novel and efficient CCHA for nomadic things in the IoT 
and  clustering  of  ubiquitous  things  to  achieve  lifetime, 
scalability  and  robustness.  In  CCHA,  context  is  inte-
grated together with clustering and hierarchical address-
ing  for  proposed  identifier  format.  Simulation  results 
show  that  how  CCHA  is  beneficial  to  create  different 
namespaces and results into better performance in terms 
of end-to-end delay, throughput and energy expenditure 
of the network. Paper compares the results with existing 
flat  addressing  in  terms  of  aforementioned  parameters 
and  concludes  that  for  effective  IdM  in  the  IoT,  pro-
posed  identifier  format  together  with  context-aware 
clustering  for  hierarchical  addressing  is  better  choice. 
Simulation  results  also  shows  that  CCHA  is  less  prone 

to  failure  addressing  probability  making  CCHA  as  the 
right  choice  in  nomadic  and  distributed  IoT  networks. 
Paper  has  also  presented  a  mathematical  model  for 
queuing  analysis  when  the  devices  join  the  IoT  net-
works. 

Future  work  is  also  to  extend  this  identifier 
format  and  addressing  scheme  to  ensure  authentication 
and secure attribute exchange of these things.

Abstract:  As  computing  technology  becomes  more 
tightly  coupled  into  dynamic  and  mobile  world  of  the 
Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  security  mechanism  becomes 
more  stringent,  less  flexible  and  intrusive.  Scalability 
issue  in  the  IoT  makes  Identity  Management  (IdM)  of 
ubiquitous  things  more  challenging.    Forming  ad-hoc 
network,  interaction  between  these  nomadic  devices  to 
provide seamless service extend the need of new identi-
ties  to  the  things,  addressing  and  IdM  in  the  IoT.  New 
identities  and  identifier  format  to  alleviate  the  perfor-
mance issue is introduced in this paper. This paper pre-
sents novel Context-aware Clustering  with Hierarchical 
Addressing  (CCHA)  scheme  for  the  things  with  new 
identifier  format.  Simulation  results  shows  that  CCHA 
achieves  better  performance  with  less  energy  expendi-
ture, less end-to-end delay and more throughput. Results 
also  show  that  CCHA  significantly  reduces  the  failure 
probability.    Furthermore,  this  paper  also  presents  the 
framework for IdM in  the IoT and mathematical model 
for queuing analysis. 
 
Keywords: Clustering, Hierarchical Addressing, Identi-
ty Management, Internet of Things. 
 
INTRODUCTION 

The IoT is service-oriented architecture and is mandato-
ry subset of future Internet where every virtual or physi-
cal thing can communicate with every other thing giving 
seamless service to all stakeholders. The IoT is conver-
gence  of  sensors,  (Radio  Frequency  Identification) 
RFID, smart devices and anything with sensing, compu-
ting  and  communication  capability.  Devices  with  com-
munication  and  computation  capability  with  resource 
constraints  are  attached  to  the  things.  The  realistic  no-
tion of the IoT [1] has been seen with the development 
of technologies such as handheld objects, sensors, wire-
less  communication  and  mobile  Internet  access.  Seam-
less  communication  between  ubiquitous  things  in  the 
IoT  possesses  problems  of  addressing  and  IdM.  The 
greater scale and scope of the IoT increases the options 
in  which  a  user  can  interact  with  the  things  in  his/her 
physical and virtual environment. In this context, every-
day  things  are  globally  connected  and  managing  in-
creasing number of things requires scalable and efficient 
addressing  and  IdM  mechanism.  Due  to  increasing 
number  of  connected  things  in  the  IoT,  energy,  ubiqui-
tous  network  access,  secure  user  interaction  increases 
the  complexity  of  operation.  This  broader  scope  of  in-
teractions  enhances  the  need  to  extend  current  IdM 
models  to  include  new  hierarchical  identifiers  and  ad-
dressing based on clustering. Functionalities and opera-

 

1 

tional  principle  of  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  (WSN) 
makes  it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the 
IoT.  Mobility  of  these  devices,  dynamic  topology  and 
ad-hoc nature  must also be taken into consideration  for 
designing new identification and addressing schemes for 
IoT.  Things,  identities  and  the  interaction  of  the  things 
are  three  major  components  of  future  IoT  and  are  dis-
cussed below as:  

 

 

  Things include resource constrained sensors to 
object  with  RFID  rags.  The  IoT  of  future  will 
include  a  wide  array  of  devices  ranging  from 
high to low computing and communication ca-
pabilities and these things are always linked to 
some namespaces. 
Identities are the windows through which users 
interact with their things and consume services 
in today’s world. In the IoT world, this concept 
of  identity  extends  to  things  [2,  3].  Identities 
can  be  considered  as  end  points  so  that  it  is 
easy to ensure access to end point independent 
of thing being used like PDA or sensor.  
Interaction  which  is  ubiquitous  is  another  im-
portant challenge in the IoT. In the future, IoT 
users  will  be  able  to  discover  and  use  things 
that  are  public,  add  things  temporarily  to  their 
personal  space,  share  their  things  with  others, 
things that are public can be part of the person-
al space of multiple users at the same time, etc. 
and  this  association  will  be  long  term  or  short 
term.  
The  contribution  of  this  paper  is  threefold. 
First,  this  paper  addresses  research  needs  in  identities 
and  identifier  format  for  IoT.  Secondly,  this  paper  pre-
sent new identities and identifier format for devices with 
hierarchical  addressing.  Third,  result  of  comprehensive 
set of simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of clus-
tering  with  hierarchical  addressing  with  new  identifier 
format  is  presented  and  discussed.  Simulation  results 
show  better  performance  in  energy,  end-to-end  delay 
and throughput. CCHA simulation results are also com-
pared with existing solution for failure probability.  
 

This paper is structured as follows: First part of 
this  paper  focuses  on  related  works  in  the  field  of  IdM 
and  addressing  for  IoT  with  limitations.  Next  part  pre-
sents  proposed  CCHA  together  with  concept  of  identi-
ties,  identifiers  in  the  IoT,  and  identifier  format.  This 
paper  also  addresses  the  need  of  CCHA  for  IoT  things 
and  discusses  difference  between  flat  and  hierarchical 
addressing. Next section explains simulation results and 
discussion  together  with  the  mathematical  model  for 
queuing  analysis.  Finally  last  part  concludes  this  paper 
with discussion.  

RELATED WORKS 
 
Literature shows that there has been lot of  work for 
IdM  and  identities  but  none  of  the  work  addresses 
IoT.  Meaning of identity and design of identifier in 
the IoT context is one of the main issues in the view 
of resource constraints like energy, lifetime, end-to -
end delay, memory and routing overhead. Identity is 
whatever which makes the thing distinguishable and 
delineate.    Thing  under  consideration  only  has  one 
identity but  might be associated  with  many  identifi-
ers. These identifiers are  used to distinct  two things 
from each other and are context dependent. Different 
identity schemes have been proposed in the IoT and 
it  is  predicted  that  it  is  dubious  to  have  common 
identification  schemes  globally  [2].  Identification 
schemes  for  RFID  Object  Identifier,  EPCglobal, 
Short-OID  and  Near  Field  Communications  Forum 
have been studied in [2]. In [3], author addresses the 
IdM  problem  in  the  IoT  with  challenges  and 
roadmap and presents naming and addressing as one 
of the main issues for the IoT. New concept of virtu-
al  identities  for  the  IoT  is  presented  in  [4]  but  ad-
dressing  and  implementation  details  are  left  un-
addressed.  An  author  presents  the  domain  trusted 
entity  where  each  identity  is  managed  by  a  trusted 
entity  of  its  corresponding  home  domain  that  keeps 
it  under  the  preferences  set  by  its  holder.  This  ap-
proach  is  not  suitable  for  futuristic  IoT  due  to  its 
dynamic  topology  and  distributed  nature.  Use  of 
clustering  for  efficient  resource  management  in  the 
IoT is proposed in [5] achieving lifetime of network, 
scalability  and  reduced  packet  delay.  [6]  Proposes 
multi-hop  clustering  protocol  for  WSN  without  ad-
dressing  mobility.  There  have  been  many  attempts 
on  hierarchical  addressing  but  all  are  focusing  IP 
networks, Internet domain level in the current inter-
net  and  not  suitable  for  IoT  [7,  8,  and  9].  The  Do-
main  Name  System  (DNS)  is  a  hierarchical  naming 
system built on a distributed database for computers, 
services, or any resource connected to the Internet or 
a private network [10]. DNS is not suited for critical 
infrastructure and is prone to spoofing and authenti-
cation  problem.    Meanwhile,  the  Distributed  Hash 
Table  (DHT)  is  adopted  as  the  underlying  structure 
to  construct  the  basic  UID  management  methodolo-
gy [11]. Problems using DHT for IdM are achieving 
load  balancing  while  mapping  keys  to  nodes  and 
forwarding lookup for a key to appropriate node.  
 

Each thing in the IoT is always linked to some 
namespace. The notion of namespace here is much clos-
er to the notion of scenario or application under consid-
eration  as  well  as  context  in  which  things  operate  and 
provide  service.  Things  are  classified  into  two  types  as 
either things that are computers equipped with commu-
nication  interfaces  or  things  which  are  not  computers 
but  are  associated  with  computers  equipped  with  com-
munication interfaces. To this purpose, there is a need to

design  new  hierarchical  identifiers,  applying  hierar-
chical  addressing  by  grouping  the  objects  into  domains 
and clusters.  

PROPOSED NOVEL CONTEXT-AWARE 
CLUSTERING WITH HIRARCHICAL 
ADDRESSING (CCHA)  

Functionalities and operational principle of WSN makes 
it  appropriate  and  mandatory  candidate  of  the  IoT.  De-
vices  with  ubiquitous  and  wireless  communication  ca-
pabilities  are  attached  to  the  object  satisfying  the  need 
of IoT. Dynamic  network topology,  collaborative,  mul-
ti-hop communication and interactions of devices in all 
way  can  be  achieved  using  clustering  resulting  into 
scalability.  We define clustering as grouping of similar 
objects/devices or sensors in given context by achieving 
logical  organizing.  In  the  IoT,  this  paper  classifies 
things  into  three  types  as  people  (Users),  devices 
(Things)  and  information  (cloth,  medicine).  Depending 
on  the  context,  there  are  different  types  of  clustering 
like static, dynamic, single hop and multi hop, homoge-
nous and heterogeneous. This paper argues that cluster-
ing  reduces  the  number  of  devices  taking  part  in  trans-
mission  resulting  in  useful  energy  consumption;  scala-
bility  for  large  number  of  devices  and  also  reduces 
communication  overhead  for  single  hop  and  multi  hop 
communication  maintaining  namespaces.  Clustering 
algorithm can be classified as heuristic,  weighted, hier-
archical 
[12, 
13].Heuristic  algorithms  are  metrics  independent  algo-
rithms  and  gives  reasonable  performance  with  optimal 
solution. In heuristic  method  of clustering, cluster  head 
can  be  selected  depending  on  the  node  ID  or  neighbor 
also  can  be  selected  as  cluster  head.  In  weighted 
schemes,  weight  function  is  calculated  depending  on 
parameters  like  transmission  power,  mobility  and  ener-
gy of the node. This weighted function is used to select 
cluster head. In grid scheme, nodes are arranged in grid 
like structure and grid is built dynamically and random-
ly.  As  clustering  algorithm  is  not  in  the  scope  of  this 
paper,  we  use  normal  clustering  to  create  domain  and 
one  node  is  cluster  head  in  each  cluster.  Example  sce-
nario is shown in the Figure 1.

Use of hierarchical addressing is explained be-
low.  With  the  help  of  hierarchical  addressing,  we  can 
apply structure to identifiers such that left parts of iden-
tifier refer to individual block of network and right part 
refers  to  individual  node.  Advantages  of  hierarchical 
addressing  are  easy  manageability  with  optimized  per-
formance,  scalability  and  low  memory  and  bandwidth 
requirements.  Main  property  of  hierarchical  addressing 
is  that  it  support  aggregation  feature.  Aggregation  is  a 
summarization i.e.  grouping  of  many  identifiers  for  en-
hanced  routing  performance  and  stability.  Routing  is 
simplified by hierarchical addressing because sequences 
of steps are depending on individual  field. Hierarchical 
addresses  can  also  be  assigned  without  the  need  for  a 
central  authority  and  ellipsis  of  addresses  for  local 
namespace  use  is  easy.  Hierarchical  addresses  are  easy 
to change in case of mobility of devices in the IoT sub-
ject  to  efficient  use  of  address  space  and  suitable  con-
text dependent clustering.  Routing becomes complex in 
case  of  flat  addressing  as,  there  is  no  relationship  be-
tween actual address and the  naming  system. The  most 
famous addressing solution is Dynamic Host Configura-
tion  Protocol  (DHCP)  [14]  which  provides  configura-
tion  parameters  for  internet  host  and  is  based  on  client 
server model. In IoT, access to DHCP server for address 
assignment  cannot  be  guaranteed.  Distributed  Address 
Assignment (DAA) is presented in Zigbee Alliance [15] 
where  free  address  is  assigned  to  new  device  through 
association process. The probability that the device may 
fail to acquire an available address from its neighbors is 
more  in  DAA.  This  addressing  failure  occurs  due  to 
shortage of addresses or geographical location of devic-
es.  Pre-emptive  Distributed  Address  Assignment 
(PDAA) which is an automatic address assignment with 
unicity  is  presented  in  [16]  but  it  is  designed  for  fixed 
WSN. Due to this limitation, it is not possible to use this 
in  the  IoT.  Different  between  flat  and  hierarchical  ad-
dressing  based  on  different  parameters  is  given  in  the

A.  Proposed Identifier Format 

This section describes proposed  work  for identities and 
identities for IoT.  
 

a.  Identifiers in IoT 

An  identifier  discerns  different  users,  place  or 
thing  within 
the  context  of  specific  namespace. 
Namespace  plays  important  role  in  defining  identifier 
because  identifiers  are  always  local  to  the  current 
namespace.  For  example  user  and  sensor  both  have 
identifiers. User may be associated with bank, his office 
or  home.  Here  bank,  office  and  home  are  different 
namespaces  and  each  will  have  different  identifiers. 
Each identifier is meaningful in the namespace and only 
when  associated  with  thing  being  identified.  Example 
for CAR entity and its identifiers are shown in below.  

CAR =    {VIN, LICENCE PLATE, TYPE} 

 

CAR  has  three  identifiers  and  association  of 
CAR with one of the identifier is used depending on the 
context  and  the  namespace.  Precisely,  identifier  can  be 
defined in generic way as having three parameters as 
Identifier = {Thing, Identifier, Namespace} 

 
e.g.    {CAR  ,  VIN  ,  RTO_DB  }  ,  {  SENSOR  , 
NODE_ID , HOME_GATEWAY } , { TAG , EPCID 
, LOCAL_DB }  

 

 

Things  are  associated  with  many  identifiers 

and are show in the Figure 2.  

Fig. 2: Things and Identifiers in IoT 

 

 

An  attribute  is  dedicated  characteristic  associ-
ated with an entity like sensor node or object with RFID 
tag  in  the  IoT.  As  attributes  are  only  going  to  be  ex-
changed  for  association  with  an  identifiers,  meaningful 
attributes of things need to be defined for the IoT along 
with the scope rules. Attributes will vary from personal 
space  to  public  space.    Broadly,  there  are  two  types  of 
attributes  persistent  attribute  which  are  permanent  at-
tributes of thing and non-persistent attributes which are 
temporary attributes of things.  This paper proposes that 
each thing should be associated with at least one persis-
tent and one non-persistent attribute in the IoT. As both 
types of attribute will have different meaning in the lo-
cal context.  

b.  Identification and Identifier Format  

 

Association of identifier with thing presenting an attrib-
ute  is  called  as  identification.  For  example,  thing  is 
PDA  with  ID1,  this  example  includes  accepting  the  as-
sociation between thing PDA and its attribute as ID1. As 
discussed in above section, things can have many identi-
fiers and each identifier has to be associated with it de-
pending  on  the  context.  Identification  is  applicable  to 
both things and users and requires identifier. Things are 
always  acquiring  some  attributes  and  authentication  is 
referred  as  collection  of  proofs  for  attribute.  When 
things  communicate  with  each  other,  or  provide  any 
service,  they  always  provide  some  attribute  along  with 
identifier to authenticate. Identification is represented as 

{Thing identified, thing} ε Namespace 

 

IdM  is  set  of  processes  that  consist  of  identity 
binding,  identity  mapping  and  authentication.  It  in-
volves  management  and  exchange  of  thing  identity  in-
formation  also  known  as  digital  identity.  Precisely  we 
define IdM as management of identity followed by iden-
tity  authentication  and  attribute  authentication.  In  the 
IoT, each end point user, service or thing will be repre-
sented by an identity and identity is set of temporary or 
permanent  attributes  of  things.  Depending  on  the  con-
text  in  use,  the  separate  context  identity  (CID)  [17]  is 
used  with  the  help  of  domain  and  clustering  as  dis-
cussed  in  above  section.  In  order  to  support  context 
awareness and applying namespace dependent identifier 
to  thing,  utilization  of  context  information  is  important 
aspect. General definition of context is any information 
that can be used to classify the situation of an entity. An 
entity  is  a  person,  place,  or  object  that  is  considered 
relevant to the interaction between  a user and an appli-
cation. It is clear that such information is very important 
to  select  apply  appropriate  identifier  to  thing.  We  pro-
pose framework for IdM in the IoT in which IdM is one 
layer  with  the  set  of  processes  mentioned  above.  Con-
text management, identity binding, mapping and lifecy-
cle  management are key  milestones  which takes identi-
ties  and  credentials  as  an  input.  This  proposed  frame-
work is shown in the Figure 3.  
 

Fig. 3: Proposed Framework for IdM in the IoT

Figure  4  shows  identifier  format  for  things  in 
the IoT. As discussed in above sections, nomadic things 
in  the  IoT  can  join  to  public  or  private  IoT.  In  this  re-
gards, it is essential to assign ownership to these things. 
As  things  can  be  people,  thing  or  information  and  this 
classification  must  be  present  as  one  the  parameter  in 
format. It should be easy to know the thing is RFID tag, 
sensor node, sensor network or PDA. For unique identi-
fication  purpose,  unique  identifiers  like  EUI-64  bit  of 
802.15.4,  EPC  code  [2]  or  any  other  unique  identifiers 
are associated with format. This format for thing should 
have  association  with  the  different  attributes  and  these 
attributes  are  decided on  the  namespace  in  which  thing 
is being used.

clustering. 
addressing,  proposed 
identifier  format  is  applied  in  bit  string  format  and 
clustering  is  used  to  provide  the  namespaces.  This 
research  focuses  on  the  comparison  of  flat  addressing 
and  hierarchical  addressing  with  clustering  for  same

environment 
independent  of  underlying  MAC  and  routing  protocol. 
Objective  is  to  measure  the  performance  of  proposed 
type  of  hierarchical  identifiers  for  different  mobile 
nodes  under  different  flow  conditions.  Flow  condition 
represents single source– single destination and multiple 
source  –  multiple  destination  flow  for  mobile  nodes  as 
both types of flow could be  envisage in the IoT. Result 
of  different  simulation  scenario  is  discussed  below.  In 
clustering,  total  nodes  are  divided  into  five  different 
domains  to  create  different  namespaces  and  in  each 
domain two clusters are created with five nodes in each 
cluster.  These  clusters  are  communicating  with  each 
other through cluster head of one domain to cluster head 
of  other  domain.  For  simulation  purpose,  sample 
contexts are applied to different measurements.  
 

Figure 5 depicts the variation in end-to-end de-
lay for different rate for flat and hierarchical addressing. 
Nodes  are  organized  in  different  domains  and  in  each 
domain  consist  of  some  number  of  clusters  with  one 
cluster  head  per  each  cluster  and  simulation  parameter 
are kept same  for both  flat and hierarchical addressing. 
Simulation result in the Figure 5 shows that there is less 
end-to-end delay in CCHA for varying rate.

Relation  between  rate  and  throughput  with 
varying rate for both the types of addressing is shown in 
figure 6. It depicts that, organizing devices into different 
namespaces  as  per  context  requirement  does  not  affect 
the throughput. A simulation result shows that through-
put  for  this  ad-hoc  network  is  same  in  flat  and  hierar-
chical  addressing.  In  case  of  clustering  the  devices,  as 
the  communication  is  happening  through  cluster  heads, 
there is no difference in throughput. This encourages the 
proposed  schemes  of  CCHA  in  the  IoT  because 
throughput  is  most  important  parameter  for  utilization

of  the  resource  constrained  IoT.  Lifetime  of  WSN 
which is excellent candidate for the IoT depends on the 
context in which it is being used. Expected lifetime has 
high  impact  on  the  energy  efficiency  and  robustness  of 
the  individual  devices  and  in  turn  the  network  as  a 
whole. Figure 7 show that clustering reduces the energy 
expenditure  and  thus  improve  the  scalability  and  ro-
bustness of device network in  the IoT. CCHA is useful 
for better improvement in parameters like energy, end to 
end delay, and throughput with scalability.

The total service  time comprises of two  factors, expec-

kept constant as 16 bit. Figure 8 shows the failure prob-
ability  versus the  number of  devices in IoT for address 
length  16.  Figure  compares  the  failure  probability  of 
DAA,  PDAA  and  CCHA.  Figure  8  show  that  CCHA 
scheme  encounters  fewer  addressing  failures  as  com-
pared  to  DAA  and  PDAA  for  different  number  of  de-
vices in IoT. This proves that, in CCHA scheme, devic-
es are more like to associate than others hence making it 
scalable and energy efficient in nature. 
 

a.  Mathematical Model 

The proposed CCHA model consists of a cluster head or 
gateway  party  referred  as  Identifier  Allocator  (IA) 
which  is  responsible  for  context-aware  hierarchical  ad-
dress  assignment  to  the  devices  joining  the  IoT  net-
works. Devices approaching IA for identifiers are man-
aged  in  queue.  Figure  9  shows  the  system,  where     is 
the  arrival  rate  of  devices.  The  inter-arrival  time  for 
devices  is  exponentially  distributed.  Thus  arrival  rate 
follows  the  poisons  arrival  process.  Proposed  CCHA 
system  can  be  modelled  with  M/D/1  queuing  model 
with  constant  service  rate  and  one  server.  To  evaluate 
the system performance, we model the sojourn time that 
is total time spend by the device in the system.

The expectation of waiting time for devices in the queue 
can be given in equation (1) as, 
 [  ]           [ ]    [ ]                                       (1) 
Where,     = mean number of devices in queue                         
 [ ] = service time of IA   
 [ ] = residual time 
 
Thus  by  Llittle’s  formula  [19],  mean  queue  length  is 
given equation (2) as, 
           [  ]                                                            (2) 
Therefore,  [  ]    
 
Where,  utilization of IA is given as,             [ ] 
The  residual  time,      is  the  service  time  remaining  to 
the  device  being  served  when  the      device  arrives  at 
queue. Mean residual time can be calculated by dividing 
sum of areas of triangles by the length of interval and is 
derived in equation (3).

Thus, from equations (1) to (7), it can be con-
cluded that the total time spent by a device in system is 
function  of  the  service  time   [ ] and  utilization  of  IA, 
   .  The  mean  queue  length  and  utilization  are  propor-
tional  to  each  other.  If  number  of  devices  in  queue  in-
creases the utilization of IA also increases [18]. 
 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
 
IdM  and  addressing  of  ubiquitous  things  is  one  of  the 
main issues in resource constrained IoT. To solve ensu-
ing problem, this paper has proposed concept of identi-
ty,  identification  and  identifier  format.  It  also  proposes 
novel and efficient CCHA for nomadic things in the IoT 
and  clustering  of  ubiquitous  things  to  achieve  lifetime, 
scalability  and  robustness.  In  CCHA,  context  is  inte-
grated together with clustering and hierarchical address-
ing  for  proposed  identifier  format.  Simulation  results 
show  that  how  CCHA  is  beneficial  to  create  different 
namespaces and results into better performance in terms 
of end-to-end delay, throughput and energy expenditure 
of the network. Paper compares the results with existing 
flat  addressing  in  terms  of  aforementioned  parameters 
and  concludes  that  for  effective  IdM  in  the  IoT,  pro-
posed  identifier  format  together  with  context-aware 
clustering  for  hierarchical  addressing  is  better  choice. 
Simulation  results  also  shows  that  CCHA  is  less  prone 

to  failure  addressing  probability  making  CCHA  as  the 
right  choice  in  nomadic  and  distributed  IoT  networks. 
Paper  has  also  presented  a  mathematical  model  for 
queuing  analysis  when  the  devices  join  the  IoT  net-
works. 

Future  work  is  also  to  extend  this  identifier 
format  and  addressing  scheme  to  ensure  authentication 
and secure attribute exchange of these things.
