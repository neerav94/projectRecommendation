Introduction

This paper describes the main outcomes of our research which is 
focused on the problematic of design and development of a universal

physical assets, or the operating environment, they will generate better 
information  and  analysis,  which  can  significantly  enhance  decision 
making process. Companies can begin to track and count everything, 
and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost - the range of possible uses for 
tracking is expanding [5]. The major advantage of using RFID tags is 
that multiple RFID tags can be read at the same time, and they can be 
hidden inside materials and objects, unlike barcodes which can only be 
read one at a time and need to be placed outside on items to be scanned. 
Fuhrer et al. [12] show how technologies of identification by RFID 
can be used to build a smart hospital which optimizes processes, and 
enhances  the  quality  of  service.  This  paper  also  presents  how  the 
technology can be used for an assets tracking application. Thanks to 
several  initiatives  several  open-source  RFID  frameworks,  such  as 
foosstrak project [13], Aspire RFID [14] and Mobitec [15] have been 
developed which provide unlicensed use of RFID middleware stacks. 
These  open  source  RFID  frameworks  contain  numerous  modules 
and tools and require deep knowledge of their internal principles and 
mechanism together with a considerable amount of development work 
to install or modify these solutions for the specific conditions of a real 
application. Schwartz [16] describes Microsoft’s commercial approach 
to  RFID  that  offers  a  way  of  communication  and  control  of  RFID 
devices  on  the  Microsoft  Windows  platform.  This  solution  is  called 
BizTalk RFID and includes software layers approach - ones that allow 
all types of RFID devices, sensors, and EPC (Electronic Product Code) 
readers to be integrated in a plug-and-play method. Other commercial 
platforms  for  RFID  are  Rifidi  [17],  Aspire  RFID  [18],  Oracle,  IBM, 
Detego [19], OAT RFID middleware platform [20] and DEPCAS [21]. 
In  comparison  with  the  previously  mentioned  RFID  platforms  our 
system has similar functionality, however, it adds one unique function 
which  is  the  evaluation  of  the  direction  of  an  identification  tag’s 
passage and provides a simpler system configuration and management 
but it is not primarily designed for large installations with numerous 
facilities in different locations or countries. Our platform is primarily 
targeted to smaller installations such as, for example, a hospital laundry 
management  system  whose  use-case  is  presented  in  the  following 
chapter.
RFID Laundry Inventory System

This paper also describes a case study of how RFID technology can be 
used to simplify operations and improve the effectiveness and efficiency 
of laundry management. This use-case gives a better understanding of 
the main advantages of the proposed platform and shows the benefits 
of  its  implementation  to  a  real  application  environment.  Since  the 
laundry RFID tags can be attached to cloth and linen, the possibility 
of reading laundry information has raised opportunities for automatic 
identification.  The  IoT  technology  is  opening  new  frontiers  for 
improving and changing processes and consumer interactions and even 
entire business models can be fine-tuned to take advantage of accessible 
data. It will have implications for organizational-structures, as well as 
for the way of how decisions are made, operations are managed, and 
for  optimization  of  processes  in  which  traditional  approaches  have 
not brought satisfactory results. Changes in information patterns have 
created a market for entirely new solutions and more innovative ways 
to  enable  new  services,  smarter  decisions  and  business  models,  and 
reduce costs. 
Use-cases  related  to  the  requirements  of  a 
management system  and managerial implication

laundry 

For  example,  a  manual  laundry  tracking  process  is  very  labour 
intensive,  because  obtaining  detailed  records  requires  it  to  separate, 

Page 2 of 7

count, record (e.g. by handwriting notes) and insert into a computer 
different  types  of  laundry  items  [22].  Cost  effective  and  efficient 
laundry  management  demands  sophisticated  laundry  management 
software  and  tagging  systems.  An  advanced  automatic  identification 
technology  based  on  the  RFID  technology  would  have  significant 
added value for inventory systems (i.e. computer data can in real-time 
show if the inventory stored in the stock is correct and has adequate 
quantity).This solution with many managerial implications can reduce 
the time and effort necessary for processing, shipping and receiving the 
laundry, and provide ultimate control and accountability in the process 
of laundry circulation - (e.g. status, current location, last recorded time, 
number  of  left  washing  cycles,  information  about  used  material  and 
washing  conditions,  etc.).  The  basic  infrastructure  necessary  for  this 
type of practical application includes readers and tags, as well as RFID 
management software, all designed to work together seamlessly. 

It  was  necessary  to  map  the  processes  to  refine  the  system 
requirements.  The  requirements  for 
locating  RFID  readers  for 
comprehensive coverage were identified by mapping the movement of 
monitored laundry items. Based on the results of mapping a process 
the possible readers location and requirements for the RFID readers, 
and modes of operation was determined. The system allows four basic 
modes, namely: 

•	

•	

Simple reporting, single report mode – the first occurrence of 
the monitored items is reported. As long as the item leaves the 
signal range of the antenna for a specified period of time, there 
is no further reporting.
Simple reporting by each antenna– similar to simple reporting, 
but associated with a single antenna. If the laundry is moved 
within the second antenna signal range, it is also reported by 
the other antenna.

•	 Periodic  reporting  –  if  the  laundry  is  within  range  of  the 
antenna, there is a periodic report from the antennas with the 
strongest signal.

•	 Detection of passage direction – in the case of two, or a multi 
– port reader, passage direction is determined on the basis of 
signals  from  the  antennas.  For  example,  if  the  first  antenna 
is considered external antenna and a second antenna for the 
internal antenna, the passage between 1 and 2 is reported as the 
direction of “IN” and the passage between 1 and 2 is reported 
as “OUT”.

All of these modes can be used on any connected reader. Algorithms 
for evaluating signals from readers are implemented at the middleware 
level.The modularity of the solution then lies in the possibility of adding 
another RFID reader. This reader can be operated in any of the four 
modes described above. The information gained from the report of the 
readers and antennas can thus by used for specific use applications. 

A general schematic of laundry circulation in a hospital environment 
is in Figure 1. All operations and steps which follow the movement of 
linen from the wash house to user and back are illustrated. Linen can 
be monitored after or during all these steps and the system operator 
has real-time information about the actual position of single linen item, 
but also about its general condition (e.g. number of completed washing 
cycles and its condition), total amounts, losses and damages, and can 
immediately react to new linen requests. The RFID IoT system can be 
also helpful in processes where the operator needs to be informed about 
i.e. an incorrect washing program or maximum temperature of ironing 
of the processed linen, because all this information is stored, managed

several  initiatives  several  open-source  RFID  frameworks,  such  as 
foosstrak project [13], Aspire RFID [14] and Mobitec [15] have been 
developed which provide unlicensed use of RFID middleware stacks. 
These  open  source  RFID  frameworks  contain  numerous  modules 
and tools and require deep knowledge of their internal principles and 
mechanism together with a considerable amount of development work 
to install or modify these solutions for the specific conditions of a real 
application. Schwartz [16] describes Microsoft’s commercial approach 
to  RFID  that  offers  a  way  of  communication  and  control  of  RFID 
devices  on  the  Microsoft  Windows  platform.  This  solution  is  called 
BizTalk RFID and includes software layers approach - ones that allow 
all types of RFID devices, sensors, and EPC (Electronic Product Code) 
readers to be integrated in a plug-and-play method. Other commercial 
platforms  for  RFID  are  Rifidi  [17],  Aspire  RFID  [18],  Oracle,  IBM, 
Detego [19], OAT RFID middleware platform [20] and DEPCAS [21]. 
In  comparison  with  the  previously  mentioned  RFID  platforms  our 
system has similar functionality, however, it adds one unique function 
which  is  the  evaluation  of  the  direction  of  an  identification  tag’s 
passage and provides a simpler system configuration and management 
but it is not primarily designed for large installations with numerous 
facilities in different locations or countries. Our platform is primarily 
targeted to smaller installations such as, for example, a hospital laundry 
management  system  whose  use-case  is  presented  in  the  following 
chapter.
RFID Laundry Inventory System

This paper also describes a case study of how RFID technology can be 
used to simplify operations and improve the effectiveness and efficiency 
of laundry management. This use-case gives a better understanding of 
the main advantages of the proposed platform and shows the benefits 
of  its  implementation  to  a  real  application  environment.  Since  the 
laundry RFID tags can be attached to cloth and linen, the possibility 
of reading laundry information has raised opportunities for automatic 
identification.  The  IoT  technology  is  opening  new  frontiers  for 
improving and changing processes and consumer interactions and even 
entire business models can be fine-tuned to take advantage of accessible 
data. It will have implications for organizational-structures, as well as 
for the way of how decisions are made, operations are managed, and 
for  optimization  of  processes  in  which  traditional  approaches  have 
not brought satisfactory results. Changes in information patterns have 
created a market for entirely new solutions and more innovative ways 
to  enable  new  services,  smarter  decisions  and  business  models,  and 
reduce costs. 
Use-cases  related  to  the  requirements  of  a 
management system  and managerial implication

laundry 

For  example,  a  manual  laundry  tracking  process  is  very  labour 
intensive,  because  obtaining  detailed  records  requires  it  to  separate, 

Page 2 of 7

count, record (e.g. by handwriting notes) and insert into a computer 
different  types  of  laundry  items  [22].  Cost  effective  and  efficient 
laundry  management  demands  sophisticated  laundry  management 
software  and  tagging  systems.  An  advanced  automatic  identification 
technology  based  on  the  RFID  technology  would  have  significant 
added value for inventory systems (i.e. computer data can in real-time 
show if the inventory stored in the stock is correct and has adequate 
quantity).This solution with many managerial implications can reduce 
the time and effort necessary for processing, shipping and receiving the 
laundry, and provide ultimate control and accountability in the process 
of laundry circulation - (e.g. status, current location, last recorded time, 
number  of  left  washing  cycles,  information  about  used  material  and 
washing  conditions,  etc.).  The  basic  infrastructure  necessary  for  this 
type of practical application includes readers and tags, as well as RFID 
management software, all designed to work together seamlessly. 

It  was  necessary  to  map  the  processes  to  refine  the  system 
requirements.  The  requirements  for 
locating  RFID  readers  for 
comprehensive coverage were identified by mapping the movement of 
monitored laundry items. Based on the results of mapping a process 
the possible readers location and requirements for the RFID readers, 
and modes of operation was determined. The system allows four basic 
modes, namely: 

•	

•	

Simple reporting, single report mode – the first occurrence of 
the monitored items is reported. As long as the item leaves the 
signal range of the antenna for a specified period of time, there 
is no further reporting.
Simple reporting by each antenna– similar to simple reporting, 
but associated with a single antenna. If the laundry is moved 
within the second antenna signal range, it is also reported by 
the other antenna.

•	 Periodic  reporting  –  if  the  laundry  is  within  range  of  the 
antenna, there is a periodic report from the antennas with the 
strongest signal.

•	 Detection of passage direction – in the case of two, or a multi 
– port reader, passage direction is determined on the basis of 
signals  from  the  antennas.  For  example,  if  the  first  antenna 
is considered external antenna and a second antenna for the 
internal antenna, the passage between 1 and 2 is reported as the 
direction of “IN” and the passage between 1 and 2 is reported 
as “OUT”.

All of these modes can be used on any connected reader. Algorithms 
for evaluating signals from readers are implemented at the middleware 
level.The modularity of the solution then lies in the possibility of adding 
another RFID reader. This reader can be operated in any of the four 
modes described above. The information gained from the report of the 
readers and antennas can thus by used for specific use applications. 

A general schematic of laundry circulation in a hospital environment 
is in Figure 1. All operations and steps which follow the movement of 
linen from the wash house to user and back are illustrated. Linen can 
be monitored after or during all these steps and the system operator 
has real-time information about the actual position of single linen item, 
but also about its general condition (e.g. number of completed washing 
cycles and its condition), total amounts, losses and damages, and can 
immediately react to new linen requests. The RFID IoT system can be 
also helpful in processes where the operator needs to be informed about 
i.e. an incorrect washing program or maximum temperature of ironing 
of the processed linen, because all this information is stored, managed

Abstract

Our  paper  presents  an  approach  of  how  RFID  technology  can  be  used  to  simplify  operations  and  improve  the 
effectiveness and efficiency of inventory management. The goal of our research is to design system architecture for 
identifying and monitoring movement of monitored items. The basic requirement is to create a modular system and 
application  of  this  system  for  real  hospital  laundry  management  application.  We  analysed  possible  solutions  and 
available technologies. We also analysed a specific use-case of laundry management process for designed laundry 
monitoring system based on the IoT platform principles. The development is related to the hot topic of the Internet of 
Things and the utilization of RFID technology as a key technology for detection and identification of monitored objects.

Introduction

This paper describes the main outcomes of our research which is 
focused on the problematic of design and development of a universal 
system  for  monitoring  the  movement  of  objects  and  things.  In  the 
second  chapter  of  the  paper  there  is  an  analysis  and  state  of  the  art 
of similar solutions and available technologies which can be used in 
the  specific  case  of  laundry  management  in  a  hospital  environment. 
An  application  scenario  and  detailed  description  of  a  use-case  and 
operation during laundry circulation process is in chapter two. Based 
on  collected  requirements  and  system  specification  we  developed 
a  universal  open  system  which  can  be  applied  to  a  wide  range  of 
application  scenarios  requiring  monitoring  the  movement  of  things 
such as logistic applications and software for control and management 
of  a  whole  range  of  items.  The  third  chapter  is  focused  on  the 
explanation of a developed system topology and its main properties and 
functions followed by the description of developed tools and modules 
for system management and testing. The last chapter summarizes our 
achievements and discusses the next steps of how we will continue in 
our following research.
State  of  the  Art  and  Importance  of  RFID  Auto-ID 
System for the Internet of Things 

Preparation  work  for  our  research  consisted  of  collecting  and 
analysing  documents  concerning  available  concepts  of  IoT  systems, 
used  identification  technologies  and  identification  tags.  The  main 
results of this preparatory phase were published in our journal paper 
describing state of the art of identification technologies [1].
Internet of Things

The term the Internet of Things (or IoT for short) was proposed 
by Kevin Ashton in 2009 [2] and the concept became popular through 
the Auto-ID Centre at MIT [3]. A thing can be a physical object with 
a virtual representation in a network Internet-like structure. It is the 
network  of  physical  objects  accessed  through  the  Internet,  that  are 
equipped with unique identifiers and an ability to automatically transfer 
data through a network without requiring manual data entry. 

The  IoT  network  infrastructure  with  self-configuring  capabilities 
interconnects  various  places,  such  as  manufacturing  or  healthcare 
facilities,  warehouses,  place  of  supply  of  services,  energy  grids,  and 
logistics  systems,  to  the  Internet.  Such  an  information  network  based 
on standard and interoperable communication protocols is formed by 

objects  having  identities,  operating  in  smart  spaces  using  intelligent 
communication interfaces. This type of information network represents a 
critical part of the connectivity platforms for system control, and provides 
opportunities to improve processes, and significantly reduce risks. 

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as the technology for IoT 
can be used to identify and track items [4-6]. It is a perfect identification 
technology for our development purposes due to its typical parameters 
such  as  wireless  reading  in  the  range  of  several  meters,  fast  reading 
of  numerous  identification  tags  at  one  time  and  the  possibility  to 
have  passive  tags  without  an  internal  source  of  energy  [6].  RFID  is 
the newest identification technique among all IoT technologies [7,8]. 
When an object can represent itself digitally, it can be controlled more 
precisely from elsewhere with high efficiency. If objects are equipped 
by  identifiers,  they  can  be  managed  and  inventoried  automatically; 
therefore, it is then possible to track the full transportation path of these 
products.  When  objects  can  both  sense  the  operating  environment 
and communicate, they become agents for understanding of real-time 
events.
The  RFID  Auto-ID  system  and  RFID  based  identification 
technologies 

The  RFID  systems  may  be  considered  a  case  of  a  wider  class  of 
Automatic  Identification  (Auto-ID)  systems  [9],  i.e.  RFID  Auto-
ID  System  [10].  In  the  IoT,  objects  are  expected  to  become  active 
participants  in  business,  information  and  control  processes.  For 
example an RFID laundry tag [11] is capable of withstanding washing 
conditions when attached to linen and it can be used to track its usage. 
It  will  offer  specific  object  identification,  and  connection  capability 
as  the  basis  for  development  of  independent  cooperative  services 
and  applications.  In  the  IoT  system  available  services  are  able  to 
interact with “smart” objects, query and change their state and collect 
associated information. As the new networks link data from products,

physical assets, or the operating environment, they will generate better 
information  and  analysis,  which  can  significantly  enhance  decision 
making process. Companies can begin to track and count everything, 
and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost - the range of possible uses for 
tracking is expanding [5]. The major advantage of using RFID tags is 
that multiple RFID tags can be read at the same time, and they can be 
hidden inside materials and objects, unlike barcodes which can only be 
read one at a time and need to be placed outside on items to be scanned. 
Fuhrer et al. [12] show how technologies of identification by RFID 
can be used to build a smart hospital which optimizes processes, and 
enhances  the  quality  of  service.  This  paper  also  presents  how  the 
technology can be used for an assets tracking application. Thanks to 
several  initiatives  several  open-source  RFID  frameworks,  such  as 
foosstrak project [13], Aspire RFID [14] and Mobitec [15] have been 
developed which provide unlicensed use of RFID middleware stacks.

identified the best points for placement of the RFID readers and their 
antennas which would ideally cover the complete process of laundry 
circulation. There are two modes of monitoring movement of laundry 
items. Firstly, passage detection mode which requires only one antenna. 
Secondly, there is possibility of monitoring movement of items using 
multi - antenna readers.

unifying purposes the IoT middleware has to control reading processes 
of all connected readers and process the raw data from the antennas 
which  contains  information  only  about  tags  in  the  communication 
range of an antenna and some of the readers add the RSSI information. 
Collected  data  are  analysed,  filtered  and  processed  by  the  algorithm 
for  determining  the  direction  of  passage.  This  information  is  then

The  lowest  level  of  the  developed  SW  module  is  a  communication 
layer  which  provides  several  communication  protocols  according  to 
required protocols by different readers from different manufacturers. 
This communication layer is made universal and developers can freely 
add  other  communication  protocols  via  the  available  SW  interface. 
Currently,  there  are  two  implemented  protocols.  The  first  one  is 
standardized  LLRP  (Low  Level  Reader  Protocol)  which  is  supported 
by major manufacturers of top class RFID readers and the second one 
is a proprietary protocol for a specific manufacturer: ChaFon, which 

offers low-cost RFID readers. The LLRP determines a protocol which 
provides access to air protocol command parameters and arranges a 
control of RFID air protocol operating timing [3]. 

The LLRP processes data from every single RFID tag in the form of 
EPC (Electronic Product Code) and a configuration of the reader (e.g. 
settings  of  reading  intervals,  transmit  power,  sensitivity  of  antennas 
etc.). 

The advantage of this approach is the possibility of using an LLRP 
reader with the support of different manufacturers and thus creating 
a  standardized  interface  depending  on  the  model  EPCIS  (Electronic 
Product  Code  Information  System).  The  EPCIS  is  an  EPC  global 
standard  that  specifies  a  means  to  enable  different  applications  to 
leverage EPC data via EPC-related data sharing [17]. The structure of 
the developed IoT middleware that processes data obtained from the 
connected readers can be seen in Figure 4.

Abstract

Our  paper  presents  an  approach  of  how  RFID  technology  can  be  used  to  simplify  operations  and  improve  the 
effectiveness and efficiency of inventory management. The goal of our research is to design system architecture for 
identifying and monitoring movement of monitored items. The basic requirement is to create a modular system and 
application  of  this  system  for  real  hospital  laundry  management  application.  We  analysed  possible  solutions  and 
available technologies. We also analysed a specific use-case of laundry management process for designed laundry 
monitoring system based on the IoT platform principles. The development is related to the hot topic of the Internet of 
Things and the utilization of RFID technology as a key technology for detection and identification of monitored objects.

Introduction

This paper describes the main outcomes of our research which is 
focused on the problematic of design and development of a universal 
system  for  monitoring  the  movement  of  objects  and  things.  In  the 
second  chapter  of  the  paper  there  is  an  analysis  and  state  of  the  art 
of similar solutions and available technologies which can be used in 
the  specific  case  of  laundry  management  in  a  hospital  environment. 
An  application  scenario  and  detailed  description  of  a  use-case  and 
operation during laundry circulation process is in chapter two. Based 
on  collected  requirements  and  system  specification  we  developed 
a  universal  open  system  which  can  be  applied  to  a  wide  range  of 
application  scenarios  requiring  monitoring  the  movement  of  things 
such as logistic applications and software for control and management 
of  a  whole  range  of  items.  The  third  chapter  is  focused  on  the 
explanation of a developed system topology and its main properties and 
functions followed by the description of developed tools and modules 
for system management and testing. The last chapter summarizes our 
achievements and discusses the next steps of how we will continue in 
our following research.
State  of  the  Art  and  Importance  of  RFID  Auto-ID 
System for the Internet of Things 

Preparation  work  for  our  research  consisted  of  collecting  and 
analysing  documents  concerning  available  concepts  of  IoT  systems, 
used  identification  technologies  and  identification  tags.  The  main 
results of this preparatory phase were published in our journal paper 
describing state of the art of identification technologies [1].
Internet of Things

The term the Internet of Things (or IoT for short) was proposed 
by Kevin Ashton in 2009 [2] and the concept became popular through 
the Auto-ID Centre at MIT [3]. A thing can be a physical object with 
a virtual representation in a network Internet-like structure. It is the 
network  of  physical  objects  accessed  through  the  Internet,  that  are 
equipped with unique identifiers and an ability to automatically transfer 
data through a network without requiring manual data entry. 

The  IoT  network  infrastructure  with  self-configuring  capabilities 
interconnects  various  places,  such  as  manufacturing  or  healthcare 
facilities,  warehouses,  place  of  supply  of  services,  energy  grids,  and 
logistics  systems,  to  the  Internet.  Such  an  information  network  based 
on standard and interoperable communication protocols is formed by 

objects  having  identities,  operating  in  smart  spaces  using  intelligent 
communication interfaces. This type of information network represents a 
critical part of the connectivity platforms for system control, and provides 
opportunities to improve processes, and significantly reduce risks. 

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as the technology for IoT 
can be used to identify and track items [4-6]. It is a perfect identification 
technology for our development purposes due to its typical parameters 
such  as  wireless  reading  in  the  range  of  several  meters,  fast  reading 
of  numerous  identification  tags  at  one  time  and  the  possibility  to 
have  passive  tags  without  an  internal  source  of  energy  [6].  RFID  is 
the newest identification technique among all IoT technologies [7,8]. 
When an object can represent itself digitally, it can be controlled more 
precisely from elsewhere with high efficiency. If objects are equipped 
by  identifiers,  they  can  be  managed  and  inventoried  automatically; 
therefore, it is then possible to track the full transportation path of these 
products.  When  objects  can  both  sense  the  operating  environment 
and communicate, they become agents for understanding of real-time 
events.
The  RFID  Auto-ID  system  and  RFID  based  identification 
technologies 

The  RFID  systems  may  be  considered  a  case  of  a  wider  class  of 
Automatic  Identification  (Auto-ID)  systems  [9],  i.e.  RFID  Auto-
ID  System  [10].  In  the  IoT,  objects  are  expected  to  become  active 
participants  in  business,  information  and  control  processes.  For 
example an RFID laundry tag [11] is capable of withstanding washing 
conditions when attached to linen and it can be used to track its usage. 
It  will  offer  specific  object  identification,  and  connection  capability 
as  the  basis  for  development  of  independent  cooperative  services 
and  applications.  In  the  IoT  system  available  services  are  able  to 
interact with “smart” objects, query and change their state and collect 
associated information. As the new networks link data from products,

physical assets, or the operating environment, they will generate better 
information  and  analysis,  which  can  significantly  enhance  decision 
making process. Companies can begin to track and count everything, 
and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost - the range of possible uses for 
tracking is expanding [5]. The major advantage of using RFID tags is 
that multiple RFID tags can be read at the same time, and they can be 
hidden inside materials and objects, unlike barcodes which can only be 
read one at a time and need to be placed outside on items to be scanned. 
Fuhrer et al. [12] show how technologies of identification by RFID 
can be used to build a smart hospital which optimizes processes, and 
enhances  the  quality  of  service.  This  paper  also  presents  how  the 
technology can be used for an assets tracking application. Thanks to 
several  initiatives  several  open-source  RFID  frameworks,  such  as 
foosstrak project [13], Aspire RFID [14] and Mobitec [15] have been 
developed which provide unlicensed use of RFID middleware stacks. 
These  open  source  RFID  frameworks  contain  numerous  modules 
and tools and require deep knowledge of their internal principles and 
mechanism together with a considerable amount of development work 
to install or modify these solutions for the specific conditions of a real 
application. Schwartz [16] describes Microsoft’s commercial approach 
to  RFID  that  offers  a  way  of  communication  and  control  of  RFID 
devices  on  the  Microsoft  Windows  platform.  This  solution  is  called 
BizTalk RFID and includes software layers approach - ones that allow 
all types of RFID devices, sensors, and EPC (Electronic Product Code) 
readers to be integrated in a plug-and-play method. Other commercial 
platforms  for  RFID  are  Rifidi  [17],  Aspire  RFID  [18],  Oracle,  IBM, 
Detego [19], OAT RFID middleware platform [20] and DEPCAS [21]. 
In  comparison  with  the  previously  mentioned  RFID  platforms  our 
system has similar functionality, however, it adds one unique function 
which  is  the  evaluation  of  the  direction  of  an  identification  tag’s 
passage and provides a simpler system configuration and management 
but it is not primarily designed for large installations with numerous 
facilities in different locations or countries. Our platform is primarily 
targeted to smaller installations such as, for example, a hospital laundry 
management  system  whose  use-case  is  presented  in  the  following 
chapter.
RFID Laundry Inventory System

This paper also describes a case study of how RFID technology can be 
used to simplify operations and improve the effectiveness and efficiency 
of laundry management. This use-case gives a better understanding of 
the main advantages of the proposed platform and shows the benefits 
of  its  implementation  to  a  real  application  environment.  Since  the 
laundry RFID tags can be attached to cloth and linen, the possibility 
of reading laundry information has raised opportunities for automatic 
identification.  The  IoT  technology  is  opening  new  frontiers  for 
improving and changing processes and consumer interactions and even 
entire business models can be fine-tuned to take advantage of accessible 
data. It will have implications for organizational-structures, as well as 
for the way of how decisions are made, operations are managed, and 
for  optimization  of  processes  in  which  traditional  approaches  have 
not brought satisfactory results. Changes in information patterns have 
created a market for entirely new solutions and more innovative ways 
to  enable  new  services,  smarter  decisions  and  business  models,  and 
reduce costs. 
Use-cases  related  to  the  requirements  of  a 
management system  and managerial implication

laundry 

For  example,  a  manual  laundry  tracking  process  is  very  labour 
intensive,  because  obtaining  detailed  records  requires  it  to  separate, 

Page 2 of 7

count, record (e.g. by handwriting notes) and insert into a computer 
different  types  of  laundry  items  [22].  Cost  effective  and  efficient 
laundry  management  demands  sophisticated  laundry  management 
software  and  tagging  systems.  An  advanced  automatic  identification 
technology  based  on  the  RFID  technology  would  have  significant 
added value for inventory systems (i.e. computer data can in real-time 
show if the inventory stored in the stock is correct and has adequate 
quantity).This solution with many managerial implications can reduce 
the time and effort necessary for processing, shipping and receiving the 
laundry, and provide ultimate control and accountability in the process 
of laundry circulation - (e.g. status, current location, last recorded time, 
number  of  left  washing  cycles,  information  about  used  material  and 
washing  conditions,  etc.).  The  basic  infrastructure  necessary  for  this 
type of practical application includes readers and tags, as well as RFID 
management software, all designed to work together seamlessly. 

It  was  necessary  to  map  the  processes  to  refine  the  system 
requirements.  The  requirements  for 
locating  RFID  readers  for 
comprehensive coverage were identified by mapping the movement of 
monitored laundry items. Based on the results of mapping a process 
the possible readers location and requirements for the RFID readers, 
and modes of operation was determined. The system allows four basic 
modes, namely: 

•	

•	

Simple reporting, single report mode – the first occurrence of 
the monitored items is reported. As long as the item leaves the 
signal range of the antenna for a specified period of time, there 
is no further reporting.
Simple reporting by each antenna– similar to simple reporting, 
but associated with a single antenna. If the laundry is moved 
within the second antenna signal range, it is also reported by 
the other antenna.

•	 Periodic  reporting  –  if  the  laundry  is  within  range  of  the 
antenna, there is a periodic report from the antennas with the 
strongest signal.

•	 Detection of passage direction – in the case of two, or a multi 
– port reader, passage direction is determined on the basis of 
signals  from  the  antennas.  For  example,  if  the  first  antenna 
is considered external antenna and a second antenna for the 
internal antenna, the passage between 1 and 2 is reported as the 
direction of “IN” and the passage between 1 and 2 is reported 
as “OUT”.

All of these modes can be used on any connected reader. Algorithms 
for evaluating signals from readers are implemented at the middleware 
level.The modularity of the solution then lies in the possibility of adding 
another RFID reader. This reader can be operated in any of the four 
modes described above. The information gained from the report of the 
readers and antennas can thus by used for specific use applications. 

A general schematic of laundry circulation in a hospital environment 
is in Figure 1. All operations and steps which follow the movement of 
linen from the wash house to user and back are illustrated. Linen can 
be monitored after or during all these steps and the system operator 
has real-time information about the actual position of single linen item, 
but also about its general condition (e.g. number of completed washing 
cycles and its condition), total amounts, losses and damages, and can 
immediately react to new linen requests. The RFID IoT system can be 
also helpful in processes where the operator needs to be informed about 
i.e. an incorrect washing program or maximum temperature of ironing 
of the processed linen, because all this information is stored, managed

and  provides  unified  data  to  upper  systems  which  will  implement 
this middleware. The proposed network infrastructure, Figure 3, can 
be used in all types of companies and applications because it can use 
existing network infrastructure. Realization of the designed middleware 
layer was done in the Microsoft .NET 4.0 framework to have a platform 
independent and Microsoft Windows OS compatible solution.

One of the main goals of our development work was to realize a 
complex SW module for obtaining data from readers, filtering, unifying 
and  providing  these  data  for  following  evaluation  or  storing  into  a 
database  system  in  an  external  database  server  [6].  For  filtering  and

provides access to air protocol command parameters and arranges a 
control of RFID air protocol operating timing [3]. 

The LLRP processes data from every single RFID tag in the form of 
EPC (Electronic Product Code) and a configuration of the reader (e.g. 
settings  of  reading  intervals,  transmit  power,  sensitivity  of  antennas 
etc.). 

The advantage of this approach is the possibility of using an LLRP 
reader with the support of different manufacturers and thus creating 
a  standardized  interface  depending  on  the  model  EPCIS  (Electronic 
Product  Code  Information  System).  The  EPCIS  is  an  EPC  global 
standard  that  specifies  a  means  to  enable  different  applications  to 
leverage EPC data via EPC-related data sharing [17]. The structure of 
the developed IoT middleware that processes data obtained from the 
connected readers can be seen in Figure 4.

The  next  goal  of  our  development  was  to  provide  secure 
communication and remote reader configuration and upgrades via a 
secure  channel.  This  was  ensured  by  several  security  mechanisms  at 
a communication and application level. Upgrade of FW in readers is 
also possible due to the modular structure of IoT middleware which 
conveys  FW  data  transport  to  the  reader.  Its  installation  and  calling 
system commands is done by DAL (Data Access Layer) of the relevant 
reader. The data access layer provides a way to give access between the 
program and any type of persistent storage. To ensure the versatility 
of the proposed solution, the configuration data is passed to the data 
link layer in XML format. A data string in XML format is decoded on 
the lowest layer and the relevant parameters of the reader are then set. 

This solution allows simple management of the settings of each reader, 
upgrading  to  the  newer  FW  versions  and  storing  these  settings  in  a 
database  system.  Implementation  of  a  non-standard  communication 
protocol  shows  the  main  advantage  of  this  modular  concept,  which 
allows easy system expansion and addition of other types of readers 
from different manufacturers into the system.

Another part of the developed software is a database system that 
allows archiving data from the readers. This database is used for long-
term testing. Data from individual transactions and iterations of tags 
are stored and used for searching of error states and their elimination. 
Relational  database  structure  is  shown  in  Figure  5.  The  database  is

Abstract

Our  paper  presents  an  approach  of  how  RFID  technology  can  be  used  to  simplify  operations  and  improve  the 
effectiveness and efficiency of inventory management. The goal of our research is to design system architecture for 
identifying and monitoring movement of monitored items. The basic requirement is to create a modular system and 
application  of  this  system  for  real  hospital  laundry  management  application.  We  analysed  possible  solutions  and 
available technologies. We also analysed a specific use-case of laundry management process for designed laundry 
monitoring system based on the IoT platform principles. The development is related to the hot topic of the Internet of 
Things and the utilization of RFID technology as a key technology for detection and identification of monitored objects.

Introduction

This paper describes the main outcomes of our research which is 
focused on the problematic of design and development of a universal 
system  for  monitoring  the  movement  of  objects  and  things.  In  the 
second  chapter  of  the  paper  there  is  an  analysis  and  state  of  the  art 
of similar solutions and available technologies which can be used in 
the  specific  case  of  laundry  management  in  a  hospital  environment. 
An  application  scenario  and  detailed  description  of  a  use-case  and 
operation during laundry circulation process is in chapter two. Based 
on  collected  requirements  and  system  specification  we  developed 
a  universal  open  system  which  can  be  applied  to  a  wide  range  of 
application  scenarios  requiring  monitoring  the  movement  of  things 
such as logistic applications and software for control and management 
of  a  whole  range  of  items.  The  third  chapter  is  focused  on  the 
explanation of a developed system topology and its main properties and 
functions followed by the description of developed tools and modules 
for system management and testing. The last chapter summarizes our 
achievements and discusses the next steps of how we will continue in 
our following research.
State  of  the  Art  and  Importance  of  RFID  Auto-ID 
System for the Internet of Things 

Preparation  work  for  our  research  consisted  of  collecting  and 
analysing  documents  concerning  available  concepts  of  IoT  systems, 
used  identification  technologies  and  identification  tags.  The  main 
results of this preparatory phase were published in our journal paper 
describing state of the art of identification technologies [1].
Internet of Things

The term the Internet of Things (or IoT for short) was proposed 
by Kevin Ashton in 2009 [2] and the concept became popular through 
the Auto-ID Centre at MIT [3]. A thing can be a physical object with 
a virtual representation in a network Internet-like structure. It is the 
network  of  physical  objects  accessed  through  the  Internet,  that  are 
equipped with unique identifiers and an ability to automatically transfer 
data through a network without requiring manual data entry. 

The  IoT  network  infrastructure  with  self-configuring  capabilities 
interconnects  various  places,  such  as  manufacturing  or  healthcare 
facilities,  warehouses,  place  of  supply  of  services,  energy  grids,  and 
logistics  systems,  to  the  Internet.  Such  an  information  network  based 
on standard and interoperable communication protocols is formed by 

objects  having  identities,  operating  in  smart  spaces  using  intelligent 
communication interfaces. This type of information network represents a 
critical part of the connectivity platforms for system control, and provides 
opportunities to improve processes, and significantly reduce risks. 

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as the technology for IoT 
can be used to identify and track items [4-6]. It is a perfect identification 
technology for our development purposes due to its typical parameters 
such  as  wireless  reading  in  the  range  of  several  meters,  fast  reading 
of  numerous  identification  tags  at  one  time  and  the  possibility  to 
have  passive  tags  without  an  internal  source  of  energy  [6].  RFID  is 
the newest identification technique among all IoT technologies [7,8]. 
When an object can represent itself digitally, it can be controlled more 
precisely from elsewhere with high efficiency. If objects are equipped 
by  identifiers,  they  can  be  managed  and  inventoried  automatically; 
therefore, it is then possible to track the full transportation path of these 
products.  When  objects  can  both  sense  the  operating  environment 
and communicate, they become agents for understanding of real-time 
events.
The  RFID  Auto-ID  system  and  RFID  based  identification 
technologies 

The  RFID  systems  may  be  considered  a  case  of  a  wider  class  of 
Automatic  Identification  (Auto-ID)  systems  [9],  i.e.  RFID  Auto-
ID  System  [10].  In  the  IoT,  objects  are  expected  to  become  active 
participants  in  business,  information  and  control  processes.  For 
example an RFID laundry tag [11] is capable of withstanding washing 
conditions when attached to linen and it can be used to track its usage. 
It  will  offer  specific  object  identification,  and  connection  capability 
as  the  basis  for  development  of  independent  cooperative  services 
and  applications.  In  the  IoT  system  available  services  are  able  to 
interact with “smart” objects, query and change their state and collect 
associated information. As the new networks link data from products,

physical assets, or the operating environment, they will generate better 
information  and  analysis,  which  can  significantly  enhance  decision 
making process. Companies can begin to track and count everything, 
and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost - the range of possible uses for 
tracking is expanding [5]. The major advantage of using RFID tags is 
that multiple RFID tags can be read at the same time, and they can be 
hidden inside materials and objects, unlike barcodes which can only be 
read one at a time and need to be placed outside on items to be scanned. 
Fuhrer et al. [12] show how technologies of identification by RFID 
can be used to build a smart hospital which optimizes processes, and 
enhances  the  quality  of  service.  This  paper  also  presents  how  the 
technology can be used for an assets tracking application. Thanks to 
several  initiatives  several  open-source  RFID  frameworks,  such  as 
foosstrak project [13], Aspire RFID [14] and Mobitec [15] have been 
developed which provide unlicensed use of RFID middleware stacks. 
These  open  source  RFID  frameworks  contain  numerous  modules 
and tools and require deep knowledge of their internal principles and 
mechanism together with a considerable amount of development work 
to install or modify these solutions for the specific conditions of a real 
application. Schwartz [16] describes Microsoft’s commercial approach 
to  RFID  that  offers  a  way  of  communication  and  control  of  RFID 
devices  on  the  Microsoft  Windows  platform.  This  solution  is  called 
BizTalk RFID and includes software layers approach - ones that allow 
all types of RFID devices, sensors, and EPC (Electronic Product Code) 
readers to be integrated in a plug-and-play method. Other commercial 
platforms  for  RFID  are  Rifidi  [17],  Aspire  RFID  [18],  Oracle,  IBM, 
Detego [19], OAT RFID middleware platform [20] and DEPCAS [21]. 
In  comparison  with  the  previously  mentioned  RFID  platforms  our 
system has similar functionality, however, it adds one unique function 
which  is  the  evaluation  of  the  direction  of  an  identification  tag’s 
passage and provides a simpler system configuration and management 
but it is not primarily designed for large installations with numerous 
facilities in different locations or countries. Our platform is primarily 
targeted to smaller installations such as, for example, a hospital laundry 
management  system  whose  use-case  is  presented  in  the  following 
chapter.
RFID Laundry Inventory System

This paper also describes a case study of how RFID technology can be 
used to simplify operations and improve the effectiveness and efficiency 
of laundry management. This use-case gives a better understanding of 
the main advantages of the proposed platform and shows the benefits 
of  its  implementation  to  a  real  application  environment.  Since  the 
laundry RFID tags can be attached to cloth and linen, the possibility 
of reading laundry information has raised opportunities for automatic 
identification.  The  IoT  technology  is  opening  new  frontiers  for 
improving and changing processes and consumer interactions and even 
entire business models can be fine-tuned to take advantage of accessible 
data. It will have implications for organizational-structures, as well as 
for the way of how decisions are made, operations are managed, and 
for  optimization  of  processes  in  which  traditional  approaches  have 
not brought satisfactory results. Changes in information patterns have 
created a market for entirely new solutions and more innovative ways 
to  enable  new  services,  smarter  decisions  and  business  models,  and 
reduce costs. 
Use-cases  related  to  the  requirements  of  a 
management system  and managerial implication

laundry 

For  example,  a  manual  laundry  tracking  process  is  very  labour 
intensive,  because  obtaining  detailed  records  requires  it  to  separate, 

Page 2 of 7

count, record (e.g. by handwriting notes) and insert into a computer 
different  types  of  laundry  items  [22].  Cost  effective  and  efficient 
laundry  management  demands  sophisticated  laundry  management 
software  and  tagging  systems.  An  advanced  automatic  identification 
technology  based  on  the  RFID  technology  would  have  significant 
added value for inventory systems (i.e. computer data can in real-time 
show if the inventory stored in the stock is correct and has adequate 
quantity).This solution with many managerial implications can reduce 
the time and effort necessary for processing, shipping and receiving the 
laundry, and provide ultimate control and accountability in the process 
of laundry circulation - (e.g. status, current location, last recorded time, 
number  of  left  washing  cycles,  information  about  used  material  and 
washing  conditions,  etc.).  The  basic  infrastructure  necessary  for  this 
type of practical application includes readers and tags, as well as RFID 
management software, all designed to work together seamlessly. 

It  was  necessary  to  map  the  processes  to  refine  the  system 
requirements.  The  requirements  for 
locating  RFID  readers  for 
comprehensive coverage were identified by mapping the movement of 
monitored laundry items. Based on the results of mapping a process 
the possible readers location and requirements for the RFID readers, 
and modes of operation was determined. The system allows four basic 
modes, namely: 

•	

•	

Simple reporting, single report mode – the first occurrence of 
the monitored items is reported. As long as the item leaves the 
signal range of the antenna for a specified period of time, there 
is no further reporting.
Simple reporting by each antenna– similar to simple reporting, 
but associated with a single antenna. If the laundry is moved 
within the second antenna signal range, it is also reported by 
the other antenna.

•	 Periodic  reporting  –  if  the  laundry  is  within  range  of  the 
antenna, there is a periodic report from the antennas with the 
strongest signal.

•	 Detection of passage direction – in the case of two, or a multi 
– port reader, passage direction is determined on the basis of 
signals  from  the  antennas.  For  example,  if  the  first  antenna 
is considered external antenna and a second antenna for the 
internal antenna, the passage between 1 and 2 is reported as the 
direction of “IN” and the passage between 1 and 2 is reported 
as “OUT”.

All of these modes can be used on any connected reader. Algorithms 
for evaluating signals from readers are implemented at the middleware 
level.The modularity of the solution then lies in the possibility of adding 
another RFID reader. This reader can be operated in any of the four 
modes described above. The information gained from the report of the 
readers and antennas can thus by used for specific use applications. 

A general schematic of laundry circulation in a hospital environment 
is in Figure 1. All operations and steps which follow the movement of 
linen from the wash house to user and back are illustrated. Linen can 
be monitored after or during all these steps and the system operator 
has real-time information about the actual position of single linen item, 
but also about its general condition (e.g. number of completed washing 
cycles and its condition), total amounts, losses and damages, and can 
immediately react to new linen requests. The RFID IoT system can be 
also helpful in processes where the operator needs to be informed about 
i.e. an incorrect washing program or maximum temperature of ironing 
of the processed linen, because all this information is stored, managed

universal  for  wide  usage  across  different  identification  technologies 
and  provides  unified  data  to  upper  systems  which  will  implement 
this middleware. The proposed network infrastructure, Figure 3, can 
be used in all types of companies and applications because it can use 
existing network infrastructure. Realization of the designed middleware 
layer was done in the Microsoft .NET 4.0 framework to have a platform 
independent and Microsoft Windows OS compatible solution.

One of the main goals of our development work was to realize a 
complex SW module for obtaining data from readers, filtering, unifying 
and  providing  these  data  for  following  evaluation  or  storing  into  a 
database  system  in  an  external  database  server  [6].  For  filtering  and

Areal example of processes which correspond to a laundry management 
system are summarized in Table 1 and all included parts of the hospital 
laundry circulation use-case are shown in Figure 2. Based on a detailed 
analysis  of  all  operations  during  the  laundry  circulation  process  we 
identified the best points for placement of the RFID readers and their 
antennas which would ideally cover the complete process of laundry 
circulation. There are two modes of monitoring movement of laundry 
items. Firstly, passage detection mode which requires only one antenna. 
Secondly, there is possibility of monitoring movement of items using 
multi - antenna readers. 
Realization  and  Description  of  Necessary  Network 
Infrastructure 

We analysed possible solutions of a communication layer for data 
transfer between different types of RFID readers and a master system 
device.  Based  on  our  research  of  available  RFID  readers  technology 
we chose Ethernet as a standardized communication interface which 
allows us to connect most of the readers on the market to our system 
[23].

We  designed  a  middleware 

layer  which  combines  a  data 
communication  part  with  a  data  processing  core  and  provides  pre-
processed  data  to  an  upper  system  layer.  This  layer  structure  with 
an  Ethernet  communication  transport  interface  makes  this  solution

unifying purposes the IoT middleware has to control reading processes 
of all connected readers and process the raw data from the antennas 
which  contains  information  only  about  tags  in  the  communication 
range of an antenna and some of the readers add the RSSI information. 
Collected  data  are  analysed,  filtered  and  processed  by  the  algorithm 
for  determining  the  direction  of  passage.  This  information  is  then 
transferred to a superior system in the form of a single iteration report. 
The  lowest  level  of  the  developed  SW  module  is  a  communication 
layer  which  provides  several  communication  protocols  according  to 
required protocols by different readers from different manufacturers. 
This communication layer is made universal and developers can freely 
add  other  communication  protocols  via  the  available  SW  interface. 
Currently,  there  are  two  implemented  protocols.  The  first  one  is 
standardized  LLRP  (Low  Level  Reader  Protocol)  which  is  supported 
by major manufacturers of top class RFID readers and the second one 
is a proprietary protocol for a specific manufacturer: ChaFon, which 

offers low-cost RFID readers. The LLRP determines a protocol which 
provides access to air protocol command parameters and arranges a 
control of RFID air protocol operating timing [3]. 

The LLRP processes data from every single RFID tag in the form of 
EPC (Electronic Product Code) and a configuration of the reader (e.g. 
settings  of  reading  intervals,  transmit  power,  sensitivity  of  antennas 
etc.). 

The advantage of this approach is the possibility of using an LLRP 
reader with the support of different manufacturers and thus creating 
a  standardized  interface  depending  on  the  model  EPCIS  (Electronic 
Product  Code  Information  System).  The  EPCIS  is  an  EPC  global 
standard  that  specifies  a  means  to  enable  different  applications  to 
leverage EPC data via EPC-related data sharing [17]. The structure of 
the developed IoT middleware that processes data obtained from the 
connected readers can be seen in Figure 4.

The  next  goal  of  our  development  was  to  provide  secure 
communication and remote reader configuration and upgrades via a 
secure  channel.  This  was  ensured  by  several  security  mechanisms  at 
a communication and application level. Upgrade of FW in readers is 
also possible due to the modular structure of IoT middleware which 
conveys  FW  data  transport  to  the  reader.  Its  installation  and  calling 
system commands is done by DAL (Data Access Layer) of the relevant 
reader. The data access layer provides a way to give access between the 
program and any type of persistent storage. To ensure the versatility 
of the proposed solution, the configuration data is passed to the data 
link layer in XML format. A data string in XML format is decoded on 
the lowest layer and the relevant parameters of the reader are then set. 

This solution allows simple management of the settings of each reader, 
upgrading  to  the  newer  FW  versions  and  storing  these  settings  in  a 
database  system.  Implementation  of  a  non-standard  communication 
protocol  shows  the  main  advantage  of  this  modular  concept,  which 
allows easy system expansion and addition of other types of readers 
from different manufacturers into the system.

Another part of the developed software is a database system that 
allows archiving data from the readers. This database is used for long-
term testing. Data from individual transactions and iterations of tags 
are stored and used for searching of error states and their elimination. 
Relational  database  structure  is  shown  in  Figure  5.  The  database  is

organized  into  several  blocks  which  make  it  universal  for  usage  not 
only in laundry management but also for other types of IoT monitoring 
systems.  Core  database  tables  store  information  about  IoT  system 
structure  and  processed  tags  and  the  rest  of  the  database  tables  is 
specific for laundry management. The mutual connection of these two 
parts provides an identification number of a tag. Thus, every tag can be 
linked via its ID to other databases primarily targeted to storage data 
from different monitoring processes or application scenarios.

For  demonstration,  testing  and  verification  of  IoT  middleware  a 
SW tool was realized which controls various connected RFID readers 
and  displays  information  about  recorded  iterations  of  tags  with  the 
connected  readers.  Testing  the  SW  tool  allows  easy  configuration  of 
the  settings  of  every  connected  reader  and  real-time  monitoring  of 
their status via the implemented IoT middleware library. A developer 
or system administrator can have access to real-time system data with 
processed information about iterations of tags within detection range 
of readers’ antennas. This makes the necessary development feedback 
about internal processes and general functionality of the system. The 
realized  testing  SW  tool  makes  development  of  filtration  algorithms 
easier  with  the  possibility  to  have  immediate  debugging  data  output 
and simplifies the configuration of the readers.

The user is immediately informed about the response of the system 
to individual passages of UHF tags through the detecting field of the 
RFID antennas of individual readers. 

This 

information  provides  the  necessary  feedback  for  the 
development  of  algorithms  for  determining  the  direction  of  passage 
of  the  UHF  identification  tags,  but  also  for  the  settings  parameters 
(e.g. gain and sensitivity of the antenna) and finding optimal physical 
placement of antennas
Conclusions

Our paper presents an approach of how RFID technology can be 
used to simplify operations and improve the effectiveness and efficiency 
of inventory management [24-28]. The main goal of our research was 
fulfilled by the development and realization of a universal and freely 
extensible  system  for  wireless  monitoring  of  things  and  objects.  We 
have found that by using one four-port RFID reader we can monitor 
four laundry operations, thereby reducing installation costs. In relation 
to the state of the art could be said that the presented network topology 
creates  a  universal  platform  for  access  to  data  from  different  RFID 
readers  from  different  vendors  which  have  different  communication 
protocols  and  standard  Implemented  in  them.  Also,  part  of  our 
research was focused on an evaluation of reliable and fast algorithms 
for determining the direction of passage of the identification tag by the 
field of connected antennas from data from all types of RFID readers. 
This function that give the information if laundry is going in or out is 
unique and it is not implemented in other RFID management systems 
which were mentioned in chapter 2.2. Other research effort was spent on 
development of a module for unifying data from the RFID readers. Due 
to different communication protocols, data formats, and different ways 
of obtaining data from RFID readers. These are moreover dependent 
on the applied settings. The unified module had to be developed and 
implemented as a data pre-processing part of the IoT middleware. 

In the first step of our research we analysed possible solutions and 
available  technologies  applicable  for  the  designed  IoT  identification 
system. Based on state of the art of identification technologies we chose 
the UHF RFIDtechnology, which fulfils all important parameters and 
can  be  used  as  a  universal  monitoring  platform.  We  also  analysed  a 
specific use-case of laundry management process in a hospital and from 

Page 6 of 7

the description of process operations we found and specified in detail 
all  the  important  requirements  to  the  designed  laundry  monitoring 
system based on the IoT platform principles.

Based  on  the  specification  of  processes,  data  flows  and  network 
topology we designed a layered structure of the IoT system. The core part 
of this system is the IoT middleware which is responsible for processing 
data from the lowest system architectural layers. The developed system is 
module based and can be extended by add-ons for communication with 
other types of RFID readers. The basic condition for development of a 
new add-on module is to implement a standardized interface for data 
transmission. Currently there are three developed communication add-
on modules available for demonstration of implementation principles 
and usage purposes of a real application. The first add-on module is 
for communication via the proprietary communication protocol with 
an RFID reader from the manufacturer ChaFon. The second one is for 
communication with an Impinj reader through the LLRP protocol with 
some extended commands and the third add-on module is for a general 
device which supports the LLRP communication protocol standard. 

The  IoT  middleware  compiles  data  from  all  connected  RFID 
readers, filters them and according to the selected reading mode of every 
single RFID reader it applies an algorithm for iteration evaluation. The 
resulting iteration reports contain all important parameters, about time, 
place, average signal strength, duration and direction of passage of a 
tag, and information about the identification tag itself which is initiator 
of this transaction. Collected iterations by the IoT middleware are then 
reported to the upper system layer for post–processing operations and 
storage in a database system. 

The realized database system is a cloud based solution which offers 
unlimited access to data from anywhere where users can be connected 
to the Internet. The user can obtain all information from the laundry 
management system anywhere s/he needs it. 

Our future work will be focused on the realization of a web server 
application which will provide a Web based Graphical User Interface for 
user-friendly control and management of a whole realized IoT system 
via the Internet, not only for classical PCs but also for smartphones and 
tablets.

Our  paper  presents  an  approach  of  how  RFID  technology  can  be  used  to  simplify  operations  and  improve  the 
effectiveness and efficiency of inventory management. The goal of our research is to design system architecture for 
identifying and monitoring movement of monitored items. The basic requirement is to create a modular system and 
application  of  this  system  for  real  hospital  laundry  management  application.  We  analysed  possible  solutions  and 
available technologies. We also analysed a specific use-case of laundry management process for designed laundry 
monitoring system based on the IoT platform principles. The development is related to the hot topic of the Internet of 
Things and the utilization of RFID technology as a key technology for detection and identification of monitored objects.

Introduction

This paper describes the main outcomes of our research which is 
focused on the problematic of design and development of a universal 
system  for  monitoring  the  movement  of  objects  and  things.  In  the 
second  chapter  of  the  paper  there  is  an  analysis  and  state  of  the  art 
of similar solutions and available technologies which can be used in 
the  specific  case  of  laundry  management  in  a  hospital  environment. 
An  application  scenario  and  detailed  description  of  a  use-case  and 
operation during laundry circulation process is in chapter two. Based 
on  collected  requirements  and  system  specification  we  developed 
a  universal  open  system  which  can  be  applied  to  a  wide  range  of 
application  scenarios  requiring  monitoring  the  movement  of  things 
such as logistic applications and software for control and management 
of  a  whole  range  of  items.  The  third  chapter  is  focused  on  the 
explanation of a developed system topology and its main properties and 
functions followed by the description of developed tools and modules 
for system management and testing. The last chapter summarizes our 
achievements and discusses the next steps of how we will continue in 
our following research.
State  of  the  Art  and  Importance  of  RFID  Auto-ID 
System for the Internet of Things 

Preparation  work  for  our  research  consisted  of  collecting  and 
analysing  documents  concerning  available  concepts  of  IoT  systems, 
used  identification  technologies  and  identification  tags.  The  main 
results of this preparatory phase were published in our journal paper 
describing state of the art of identification technologies [1].
Internet of Things

The term the Internet of Things (or IoT for short) was proposed 
by Kevin Ashton in 2009 [2] and the concept became popular through 
the Auto-ID Centre at MIT [3]. A thing can be a physical object with 
a virtual representation in a network Internet-like structure. It is the 
network  of  physical  objects  accessed  through  the  Internet,  that  are 
equipped with unique identifiers and an ability to automatically transfer 
data through a network without requiring manual data entry. 

The  IoT  network  infrastructure  with  self-configuring  capabilities 
interconnects  various  places,  such  as  manufacturing  or  healthcare 
facilities,  warehouses,  place  of  supply  of  services,  energy  grids,  and 
logistics  systems,  to  the  Internet.  Such  an  information  network  based 
on standard and interoperable communication protocols is formed by 

objects  having  identities,  operating  in  smart  spaces  using  intelligent 
communication interfaces. This type of information network represents a 
critical part of the connectivity platforms for system control, and provides 
opportunities to improve processes, and significantly reduce risks. 

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) as the technology for IoT 
can be used to identify and track items [4-6]. It is a perfect identification 
technology for our development purposes due to its typical parameters 
such  as  wireless  reading  in  the  range  of  several  meters,  fast  reading 
of  numerous  identification  tags  at  one  time  and  the  possibility  to 
have  passive  tags  without  an  internal  source  of  energy  [6].  RFID  is 
the newest identification technique among all IoT technologies [7,8]. 
When an object can represent itself digitally, it can be controlled more 
precisely from elsewhere with high efficiency. If objects are equipped 
by  identifiers,  they  can  be  managed  and  inventoried  automatically; 
therefore, it is then possible to track the full transportation path of these 
products.  When  objects  can  both  sense  the  operating  environment 
and communicate, they become agents for understanding of real-time 
events.
The  RFID  Auto-ID  system  and  RFID  based  identification 
technologies 

The  RFID  systems  may  be  considered  a  case  of  a  wider  class  of 
Automatic  Identification  (Auto-ID)  systems  [9],  i.e.  RFID  Auto-
ID  System  [10].  In  the  IoT,  objects  are  expected  to  become  active 
participants  in  business,  information  and  control  processes.  For 
example an RFID laundry tag [11] is capable of withstanding washing 
conditions when attached to linen and it can be used to track its usage. 
It  will  offer  specific  object  identification,  and  connection  capability 
as  the  basis  for  development  of  independent  cooperative  services 
and  applications.  In  the  IoT  system  available  services  are  able  to 
interact with “smart” objects, query and change their state and collect 
associated information. As the new networks link data from products,

physical assets, or the operating environment, they will generate better 
information  and  analysis,  which  can  significantly  enhance  decision 
making process. Companies can begin to track and count everything, 
and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost - the range of possible uses for 
tracking is expanding [5]. The major advantage of using RFID tags is 
that multiple RFID tags can be read at the same time, and they can be 
hidden inside materials and objects, unlike barcodes which can only be 
read one at a time and need to be placed outside on items to be scanned. 
Fuhrer et al. [12] show how technologies of identification by RFID 
can be used to build a smart hospital which optimizes processes, and 
enhances  the  quality  of  service.  This  paper  also  presents  how  the 
technology can be used for an assets tracking application. Thanks to 
several  initiatives  several  open-source  RFID  frameworks,  such  as 
foosstrak project [13], Aspire RFID [14] and Mobitec [15] have been 
developed which provide unlicensed use of RFID middleware stacks. 
These  open  source  RFID  frameworks  contain  numerous  modules 
and tools and require deep knowledge of their internal principles and 
mechanism together with a considerable amount of development work 
to install or modify these solutions for the specific conditions of a real 
application. Schwartz [16] describes Microsoft’s commercial approach 
to  RFID  that  offers  a  way  of  communication  and  control  of  RFID 
devices  on  the  Microsoft  Windows  platform.  This  solution  is  called 
BizTalk RFID and includes software layers approach - ones that allow 
all types of RFID devices, sensors, and EPC (Electronic Product Code) 
readers to be integrated in a plug-and-play method. Other commercial 
platforms  for  RFID  are  Rifidi  [17],  Aspire  RFID  [18],  Oracle,  IBM, 
Detego [19], OAT RFID middleware platform [20] and DEPCAS [21]. 
In  comparison  with  the  previously  mentioned  RFID  platforms  our 
system has similar functionality, however, it adds one unique function 
which  is  the  evaluation  of  the  direction  of  an  identification  tag’s 
passage and provides a simpler system configuration and management 
but it is not primarily designed for large installations with numerous 
facilities in different locations or countries. Our platform is primarily 
targeted to smaller installations such as, for example, a hospital laundry 
management  system  whose  use-case  is  presented  in  the  following 
chapter.
RFID Laundry Inventory System

This paper also describes a case study of how RFID technology can be 
used to simplify operations and improve the effectiveness and efficiency 
of laundry management. This use-case gives a better understanding of 
the main advantages of the proposed platform and shows the benefits 
of  its  implementation  to  a  real  application  environment.  Since  the 
laundry RFID tags can be attached to cloth and linen, the possibility 
of reading laundry information has raised opportunities for automatic 
identification.  The  IoT  technology  is  opening  new  frontiers  for 
improving and changing processes and consumer interactions and even 
entire business models can be fine-tuned to take advantage of accessible 
data. It will have implications for organizational-structures, as well as 
for the way of how decisions are made, operations are managed, and 
for  optimization  of  processes  in  which  traditional  approaches  have 
not brought satisfactory results. Changes in information patterns have 
created a market for entirely new solutions and more innovative ways 
to  enable  new  services,  smarter  decisions  and  business  models,  and 
reduce costs. 
Use-cases  related  to  the  requirements  of  a 
management system  and managerial implication

laundry 

For  example,  a  manual  laundry  tracking  process  is  very  labour 
intensive,  because  obtaining  detailed  records  requires  it  to  separate, 

Page 2 of 7

count, record (e.g. by handwriting notes) and insert into a computer 
different  types  of  laundry  items  [22].  Cost  effective  and  efficient 
laundry  management  demands  sophisticated  laundry  management 
software  and  tagging  systems.  An  advanced  automatic  identification 
technology  based  on  the  RFID  technology  would  have  significant 
added value for inventory systems (i.e. computer data can in real-time 
show if the inventory stored in the stock is correct and has adequate 
quantity).This solution with many managerial implications can reduce 
the time and effort necessary for processing, shipping and receiving the 
laundry, and provide ultimate control and accountability in the process 
of laundry circulation - (e.g. status, current location, last recorded time, 
number  of  left  washing  cycles,  information  about  used  material  and 
washing  conditions,  etc.).  The  basic  infrastructure  necessary  for  this 
type of practical application includes readers and tags, as well as RFID 
management software, all designed to work together seamlessly. 

It  was  necessary  to  map  the  processes  to  refine  the  system 
requirements.  The  requirements  for 
locating  RFID  readers  for 
comprehensive coverage were identified by mapping the movement of 
monitored laundry items. Based on the results of mapping a process 
the possible readers location and requirements for the RFID readers, 
and modes of operation was determined. The system allows four basic 
modes, namely: 

•	

•	

Simple reporting, single report mode – the first occurrence of 
the monitored items is reported. As long as the item leaves the 
signal range of the antenna for a specified period of time, there 
is no further reporting.
Simple reporting by each antenna– similar to simple reporting, 
but associated with a single antenna. If the laundry is moved 
within the second antenna signal range, it is also reported by 
the other antenna.

•	 Periodic  reporting  –  if  the  laundry  is  within  range  of  the 
antenna, there is a periodic report from the antennas with the 
strongest signal.

•	 Detection of passage direction – in the case of two, or a multi 
– port reader, passage direction is determined on the basis of 
signals  from  the  antennas.  For  example,  if  the  first  antenna 
is considered external antenna and a second antenna for the 
internal antenna, the passage between 1 and 2 is reported as the 
direction of “IN” and the passage between 1 and 2 is reported 
as “OUT”.

All of these modes can be used on any connected reader. Algorithms 
for evaluating signals from readers are implemented at the middleware 
level.The modularity of the solution then lies in the possibility of adding 
another RFID reader. This reader can be operated in any of the four 
modes described above. The information gained from the report of the 
readers and antennas can thus by used for specific use applications. 

A general schematic of laundry circulation in a hospital environment 
is in Figure 1. All operations and steps which follow the movement of 
linen from the wash house to user and back are illustrated. Linen can 
be monitored after or during all these steps and the system operator 
has real-time information about the actual position of single linen item, 
but also about its general condition (e.g. number of completed washing 
cycles and its condition), total amounts, losses and damages, and can 
immediately react to new linen requests. The RFID IoT system can be 
also helpful in processes where the operator needs to be informed about 
i.e. an incorrect washing program or maximum temperature of ironing 
of the processed linen, because all this information is stored, managed

universal  for  wide  usage  across  different  identification  technologies 
and  provides  unified  data  to  upper  systems  which  will  implement 
this middleware. The proposed network infrastructure, Figure 3, can 
be used in all types of companies and applications because it can use 
existing network infrastructure. Realization of the designed middleware 
layer was done in the Microsoft .NET 4.0 framework to have a platform 
independent and Microsoft Windows OS compatible solution.

One of the main goals of our development work was to realize a 
complex SW module for obtaining data from readers, filtering, unifying 
and  providing  these  data  for  following  evaluation  or  storing  into  a 
database  system  in  an  external  database  server  [6].  For  filtering  and

Areal example of processes which correspond to a laundry management 
system are summarized in Table 1 and all included parts of the hospital 
laundry circulation use-case are shown in Figure 2. Based on a detailed 
analysis  of  all  operations  during  the  laundry  circulation  process  we 
identified the best points for placement of the RFID readers and their 
antennas which would ideally cover the complete process of laundry 
circulation. There are two modes of monitoring movement of laundry 
items. Firstly, passage detection mode which requires only one antenna. 
Secondly, there is possibility of monitoring movement of items using 
multi - antenna readers. 
Realization  and  Description  of  Necessary  Network 
Infrastructure 

We analysed possible solutions of a communication layer for data 
transfer between different types of RFID readers and a master system 
device.  Based  on  our  research  of  available  RFID  readers  technology 
we chose Ethernet as a standardized communication interface which 
allows us to connect most of the readers on the market to our system 
[23].

We  designed  a  middleware 

layer  which  combines  a  data 
communication  part  with  a  data  processing  core  and  provides  pre-
processed  data  to  an  upper  system  layer.  This  layer  structure  with 
an  Ethernet  communication  transport  interface  makes  this  solution

unifying purposes the IoT middleware has to control reading processes 
of all connected readers and process the raw data from the antennas 
which  contains  information  only  about  tags  in  the  communication 
range of an antenna and some of the readers add the RSSI information. 
Collected  data  are  analysed,  filtered  and  processed  by  the  algorithm 
for  determining  the  direction  of  passage.  This  information  is  then 
transferred to a superior system in the form of a single iteration report. 
The  lowest  level  of  the  developed  SW  module  is  a  communication 
layer  which  provides  several  communication  protocols  according  to 
required protocols by different readers from different manufacturers. 
This communication layer is made universal and developers can freely 
add  other  communication  protocols  via  the  available  SW  interface. 
Currently,  there  are  two  implemented  protocols.  The  first  one  is 
standardized  LLRP  (Low  Level  Reader  Protocol)  which  is  supported 
by major manufacturers of top class RFID readers and the second one 
is a proprietary protocol for a specific manufacturer: ChaFon, which 

offers low-cost RFID readers. The LLRP determines a protocol which 
provides access to air protocol command parameters and arranges a 
control of RFID air protocol operating timing [3]. 

The LLRP processes data from every single RFID tag in the form of 
EPC (Electronic Product Code) and a configuration of the reader (e.g. 
settings  of  reading  intervals,  transmit  power,  sensitivity  of  antennas 
etc.). 

The advantage of this approach is the possibility of using an LLRP 
reader with the support of different manufacturers and thus creating 
a  standardized  interface  depending  on  the  model  EPCIS  (Electronic 
Product  Code  Information  System).  The  EPCIS  is  an  EPC  global 
standard  that  specifies  a  means  to  enable  different  applications  to 
leverage EPC data via EPC-related data sharing [17]. The structure of 
the developed IoT middleware that processes data obtained from the 
connected readers can be seen in Figure 4.

The  next  goal  of  our  development  was  to  provide  secure 
communication and remote reader configuration and upgrades via a 
secure  channel.  This  was  ensured  by  several  security  mechanisms  at 
a communication and application level. Upgrade of FW in readers is 
also possible due to the modular structure of IoT middleware which 
conveys  FW  data  transport  to  the  reader.  Its  installation  and  calling 
system commands is done by DAL (Data Access Layer) of the relevant 
reader. The data access layer provides a way to give access between the 
program and any type of persistent storage. To ensure the versatility 
of the proposed solution, the configuration data is passed to the data 
link layer in XML format. A data string in XML format is decoded on 
the lowest layer and the relevant parameters of the reader are then set. 

This solution allows simple management of the settings of each reader, 
upgrading  to  the  newer  FW  versions  and  storing  these  settings  in  a 
database  system.  Implementation  of  a  non-standard  communication 
protocol  shows  the  main  advantage  of  this  modular  concept,  which 
allows easy system expansion and addition of other types of readers 
from different manufacturers into the system.

Another part of the developed software is a database system that 
allows archiving data from the readers. This database is used for long-
term testing. Data from individual transactions and iterations of tags 
are stored and used for searching of error states and their elimination. 
Relational  database  structure  is  shown  in  Figure  5.  The  database  is

organized  into  several  blocks  which  make  it  universal  for  usage  not 
only in laundry management but also for other types of IoT monitoring 
systems.  Core  database  tables  store  information  about  IoT  system 
structure  and  processed  tags  and  the  rest  of  the  database  tables  is 
specific for laundry management. The mutual connection of these two 
parts provides an identification number of a tag. Thus, every tag can be 
linked via its ID to other databases primarily targeted to storage data 
from different monitoring processes or application scenarios.

For  demonstration,  testing  and  verification  of  IoT  middleware  a 
SW tool was realized which controls various connected RFID readers 
and  displays  information  about  recorded  iterations  of  tags  with  the 
connected  readers.  Testing  the  SW  tool  allows  easy  configuration  of 
the  settings  of  every  connected  reader  and  real-time  monitoring  of 
their status via the implemented IoT middleware library. A developer 
or system administrator can have access to real-time system data with 
processed information about iterations of tags within detection range 
of readers’ antennas. This makes the necessary development feedback 
about internal processes and general functionality of the system. The 
realized  testing  SW  tool  makes  development  of  filtration  algorithms 
easier  with  the  possibility  to  have  immediate  debugging  data  output 
and simplifies the configuration of the readers.

The user is immediately informed about the response of the system 
to individual passages of UHF tags through the detecting field of the 
RFID antennas of individual readers. 

This 

information  provides  the  necessary  feedback  for  the 
development  of  algorithms  for  determining  the  direction  of  passage 
of  the  UHF  identification  tags,  but  also  for  the  settings  parameters 
(e.g. gain and sensitivity of the antenna) and finding optimal physical 
placement of antennas
Conclusions

Our paper presents an approach of how RFID technology can be 
used to simplify operations and improve the effectiveness and efficiency 
of inventory management [24-28]. The main goal of our research was 
fulfilled by the development and realization of a universal and freely 
extensible  system  for  wireless  monitoring  of  things  and  objects.  We 
have found that by using one four-port RFID reader we can monitor 
four laundry operations, thereby reducing installation costs. In relation 
to the state of the art could be said that the presented network topology 
creates  a  universal  platform  for  access  to  data  from  different  RFID 
readers  from  different  vendors  which  have  different  communication 
protocols  and  standard  Implemented  in  them.  Also,  part  of  our 
research was focused on an evaluation of reliable and fast algorithms 
for determining the direction of passage of the identification tag by the 
field of connected antennas from data from all types of RFID readers. 
This function that give the information if laundry is going in or out is 
unique and it is not implemented in other RFID management systems 
which were mentioned in chapter 2.2. Other research effort was spent on 
development of a module for unifying data from the RFID readers. Due 
to different communication protocols, data formats, and different ways 
of obtaining data from RFID readers. These are moreover dependent 
on the applied settings. The unified module had to be developed and 
implemented as a data pre-processing part of the IoT middleware. 

In the first step of our research we analysed possible solutions and 
available  technologies  applicable  for  the  designed  IoT  identification 
system. Based on state of the art of identification technologies we chose 
the UHF RFIDtechnology, which fulfils all important parameters and 
can  be  used  as  a  universal  monitoring  platform.  We  also  analysed  a 
specific use-case of laundry management process in a hospital and from 

Page 6 of 7

the description of process operations we found and specified in detail 
all  the  important  requirements  to  the  designed  laundry  monitoring 
system based on the IoT platform principles.

Based  on  the  specification  of  processes,  data  flows  and  network 
topology we designed a layered structure of the IoT system. The core part 
of this system is the IoT middleware which is responsible for processing 
data from the lowest system architectural layers. The developed system is 
module based and can be extended by add-ons for communication with 
other types of RFID readers. The basic condition for development of a 
new add-on module is to implement a standardized interface for data 
transmission. Currently there are three developed communication add-
on modules available for demonstration of implementation principles 
and usage purposes of a real application. The first add-on module is 
for communication via the proprietary communication protocol with 
an RFID reader from the manufacturer ChaFon. The second one is for 
communication with an Impinj reader through the LLRP protocol with 
some extended commands and the third add-on module is for a general 
device which supports the LLRP communication protocol standard. 

The  IoT  middleware  compiles  data  from  all  connected  RFID 
readers, filters them and according to the selected reading mode of every 
single RFID reader it applies an algorithm for iteration evaluation. The 
resulting iteration reports contain all important parameters, about time, 
place, average signal strength, duration and direction of passage of a 
tag, and information about the identification tag itself which is initiator 
of this transaction. Collected iterations by the IoT middleware are then 
reported to the upper system layer for post–processing operations and 
storage in a database system. 

The realized database system is a cloud based solution which offers 
unlimited access to data from anywhere where users can be connected 
to the Internet. The user can obtain all information from the laundry 
management system anywhere s/he needs it. 

Our future work will be focused on the realization of a web server 
application which will provide a Web based Graphical User Interface for 
user-friendly control and management of a whole realized IoT system 
via the Internet, not only for classical PCs but also for smartphones and 
tablets.
