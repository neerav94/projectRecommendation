objects are represented in a virtualized environ-
ment, and where cognition and proximity are
used to select the most relevant objects for the

RELATED WORK

The previous section has identified the hetero-
geneity of objects and the need for resilience as
main challenges to be addressed by IoT in the
effort for a sustainable smart city, while it has
also introduced proximity and cognition as
promising factors toward this direction.

In the scope of IoT, the virtualization of
objects and the use of semantics are the most
important assets for addressing the heterogene-
ity of objects. The authors in [4] use virtual sen-
sor abstraction in order to hide the complexity in
large-scale interconnected sensor networks. The
CONVERGENCE project (www.ict-conver-
gence.eu/) introduces a common container for
any kind of digital data, including representa-
tions of services, people, and real-world objects.
The EBBITS project (www.ebbits-project.eu/
news.php) aims at transforming every device into
a web service with semantic resolution. The
CASAGRAS project (www.iot-casagras.org/)
suggests the object’s identification in the physical
layer through the use of ontology instead of rep-
resentations.  However,  there  is  a  need  for
dynamic and intelligent virtual representation of
objects, which will allow them to become virtual-
ly “always on” in accordance with application
requirements and despite changing conditions.

Several efforts have been performed in the
field of resilience. In [5], the authors present a
taxonomy for threats and countermeasures with
respect  to  dependability  and  security.  The
ENISA study in [6] intends to provide end-to-
end consideration of resilience through an ontol-
ogy that encompasses different domains and
helps hide the heterogeneity of the underlying
infrastructure. In [7], a security framework is
presented that comprises mechanisms to achieve
intrusion detection and reaction. The work in [8]
focuses on enhancing the resilience of superviso-
ry control and data acquisition (SCADA) sys-
tems  against  cyber  attacks.  However,  the
majority of these efforts concern separate appli-
cation domains and rely on human intervention
in order to resolve problems. The means to
enhance the cross-domain resilience capability of
IoT, where a huge aggregation of objects and
vulnerabilities exist, in a dynamic and automated
way are strongly required.

The study of the similarity between two con-
cepts based on their information presents par-
ticular  research  interest.  The  effort  in  [9]
presents an estimation of semantic proximity
between  arbitrary  concepts  and  concept
instances, using the taxonomic knowledge con-
cepts. The authors in [10] develop a collabora-
tive and proximity-based mechanism for the
clustering of semantic web documents according
to their characteristics. Semantic models and a
web service for querying are used in [11] to sup-
port efficient service discovery, while service
selection using proximity-based ontology filter-
ing  is  proposed.  The  proximity  should  be
expanded  in  IoT  in  order  to  enhance  the

description, discovery, and selection of objects
based on application requirements, moving from
proximity among objects to proximity between
users/applications and objects.

The research on cognitive management is
mainly focused on resource usage and architec-
tural efficiency in future networks. The effort
in [12] introduces cognitive and self-x princi-
ples in order to optimize the use of the radio
resources and spectrum in future networks.
The OneFit project (www.ict-onefit.eu/) com-
prises cognitive systems and opportunistic net-
works to achieve higher utilization of resources,
lower energy consumption, and reductions in
the total cost of ownership in the future Inter-
net. The UniverSelf project (www.univerself-
project.eu/) designs a unified management
framework for overcoming the management
complexity of future networking systems by
means of federation and self-management. The
introduction of cognitive management in IoT
will enable self-management and self-configu-
ration for the virtual representations of objects
and their (re)use in the context of dynamic ser-
vice provisioning.

Summarizing, the above references reveal
some issues related to how the current trends
address the heterogeneity of objects and the
need for resilience, while identifying that prox-
imity and cognitive management should expand
toward IoT to help smart city development.
These aspects are the motivation for our cogni-
tive framework, introduced in the next section.

FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

CONCEPTS

This effort proposes a cognitive management
framework for IoT that addresses the main
issues identified above:
(cid:129) The considerable number of objects that fall
within the scope of any IoT applications
and their heterogeneity

(cid:129) The inherently unreliable nature of such
objects and the guarantee of the end-to-end
resilience

(cid:129) The complexity associated with the huge
quantities of usable objects in a smart city
context

To this end we have identified the need to sup-
port end users and application providers with
techniques that can automatically select by rele-
vance all potential objects discovered to be avail-
able for use and able to meet given application
requirements. The cornerstone of the framework
is the concept of the virtual object (VO). A VO
is a virtual representation of any real-world
object (RWO), which thus becomes virtually
“always on.” VOs can be dynamically created
and destroyed, and they are dynamic objects
since  they  represent  dynamically  changing
RWOs.

In order to further enhance the resilience
capability, as well as offer an automated ability
to aggregate VOs to meet application require-
ments, the framework introduces the composite
VO  (CVO)  concept.  A  CVO  is  a  cognitive
mashup of semantically interoperable VOs (and
their offered services) that renders services in
accordance with the application requirements.

(cid:129) The considerable number of objects that fall

and their heterogeneity

(cid:129) The inherently unreliable nature of such

CVOs enable the reuse of existing VOs outside
their initial context and domain. Besides this
role of fostering aggregation of VOs into more
complex services, once created, CVOs are meant
to maintain their performance and self-reconfig-
ure as the context changes, giving our framework
better levels of resilience/reliability.

As said before, CVOs allow finding the opti-
mal possible way to deliver the application, given
both the capabilities offered by VOs and the
application requirements. The piece of the jig-
saw that completes our framework is the one
that provides the functionality of deriving the so-
called service logic, which represents the transla-
tion of the stakeholder/application requirements
into services to be fulfilled by the CVO level.
This addresses the need to reduce complexity
levels  for  the  users  of  the  platform.  Each
requested service is accompanied with specific
quality of service (QoS) requirements to further
address resilience. 

This level completes the description of how
we equipped our framework to fulfil the three
issues identified earlier. The three distinct con-
ceptual levels of our framework, — VO level,
CVO level, and service level — are illustrated in
Fig. 1.

COGNITION AND PROXIMITY

The main difference of the proposed framework
with respect to existing or past efforts is that cog-
nitive technologies are enabled with the intention
of supporting how we address the key issues high-
lighted above. Cognition is transversal to all three
levels. At the VO level, cognition is used for the
self-management and self-configuration of VOs in
order to maintain a constant link to the relevant
RWOs and manage the relevant data flows. More
precisely, envisioned cognition includes optimiza-
tion techniques to select more appropriate links
with RWOs, as well as learning techniques to pre-
dict problematic links, propose alternate links,
and generate knowledge from data.

At the CVO level, cognition is used in order
to decide on the VOs and CVOs that should be
(re)used to meet the application requirements.
CVOs are self-managed self-configurable objects
that are created dynamically in an autonomous
manner. First, techniques to acquire situation
information (e.g., monitoring relevant VOs and
their associated RWOs) are crucial, so as to dis-
cover VOs/CVOs and exploit their capabilities.
Moreover, learning techniques for predicting
future situations are also helpful in this direc-

future smart cities. This article identifies the
main issues that may prevent IoT from playing
this crucial role, such as the heterogeneity among

The previous section has identified the hetero-
geneity of objects and the need for resilience as
main challenges to be addressed by IoT in the
effort for a sustainable smart city, while it has
also introduced proximity and cognition as
promising factors toward this direction.

In the scope of IoT, the virtualization of
objects and the use of semantics are the most
important assets for addressing the heterogene-
ity of objects. The authors in [4] use virtual sen-
sor abstraction in order to hide the complexity in
large-scale interconnected sensor networks. The
CONVERGENCE project (www.ict-conver-
gence.eu/) introduces a common container for
any kind of digital data, including representa-
tions of services, people, and real-world objects.
The EBBITS project (www.ebbits-project.eu/
news.php) aims at transforming every device into
a web service with semantic resolution. The
CASAGRAS project (www.iot-casagras.org/)
suggests the object’s identification in the physical
layer through the use of ontology instead of rep-
resentations.  However,  there  is  a  need  for
dynamic and intelligent virtual representation of
objects, which will allow them to become virtual-
ly “always on” in accordance with application
requirements and despite changing conditions.

Several efforts have been performed in the
field of resilience. In [5], the authors present a
taxonomy for threats and countermeasures with
respect  to  dependability  and  security.  The
ENISA study in [6] intends to provide end-to-
end consideration of resilience through an ontol-
ogy that encompasses different domains and
helps hide the heterogeneity of the underlying
infrastructure. In [7], a security framework is
presented that comprises mechanisms to achieve
intrusion detection and reaction. The work in [8]
focuses on enhancing the resilience of superviso-
ry control and data acquisition (SCADA) sys-
tems  against  cyber  attacks.  However,  the
majority of these efforts concern separate appli-
cation domains and rely on human intervention
in order to resolve problems. The means to
enhance the cross-domain resilience capability of
IoT, where a huge aggregation of objects and
vulnerabilities exist, in a dynamic and automated
way are strongly required.

The study of the similarity between two con-
cepts based on their information presents par-
ticular  research  interest.  The  effort  in  [9]
presents an estimation of semantic proximity
between  arbitrary  concepts  and  concept
instances, using the taxonomic knowledge con-
cepts. The authors in [10] develop a collabora-
tive and proximity-based mechanism for the
clustering of semantic web documents according
to their characteristics. Semantic models and a
web service for querying are used in [11] to sup-
port efficient service discovery, while service
selection using proximity-based ontology filter-
ing  is  proposed.  The  proximity  should  be
expanded  in  IoT  in  order  to  enhance  the

description, discovery, and selection of objects
based on application requirements, moving from
proximity among objects to proximity between
users/applications and objects.

The research on cognitive management is
mainly focused on resource usage and architec-
tural efficiency in future networks. The effort
in [12] introduces cognitive and self-x princi-
ples in order to optimize the use of the radio
resources and spectrum in future networks.
The OneFit project (www.ict-onefit.eu/) com-
prises cognitive systems and opportunistic net-
works to achieve higher utilization of resources,
lower energy consumption, and reductions in
the total cost of ownership in the future Inter-
net. The UniverSelf project (www.univerself-
project.eu/) designs a unified management
framework for overcoming the management
complexity of future networking systems by
means of federation and self-management. The
introduction of cognitive management in IoT
will enable self-management and self-configu-
ration for the virtual representations of objects
and their (re)use in the context of dynamic ser-
vice provisioning.

Summarizing, the above references reveal
some issues related to how the current trends
address the heterogeneity of objects and the
need for resilience, while identifying that prox-
imity and cognitive management should expand
toward IoT to help smart city development.
These aspects are the motivation for our cogni-
tive framework, introduced in the next section.

FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

CONCEPTS

This effort proposes a cognitive management
framework for IoT that addresses the main
issues identified above:
(cid:129) The considerable number of objects that fall
within the scope of any IoT applications
and their heterogeneity

(cid:129) The inherently unreliable nature of such
objects and the guarantee of the end-to-end
resilience

(cid:129) The complexity associated with the huge
quantities of usable objects in a smart city
context

To this end we have identified the need to sup-
port end users and application providers with
techniques that can automatically select by rele-
vance all potential objects discovered to be avail-
able for use and able to meet given application
requirements. The cornerstone of the framework
is the concept of the virtual object (VO). A VO
is a virtual representation of any real-world
object (RWO), which thus becomes virtually
“always on.” VOs can be dynamically created
and destroyed, and they are dynamic objects
since  they  represent  dynamically  changing
RWOs.

In order to further enhance the resilience
capability, as well as offer an automated ability
to aggregate VOs to meet application require-
ments, the framework introduces the composite
VO  (CVO)  concept.  A  CVO  is  a  cognitive
mashup of semantically interoperable VOs (and
their offered services) that renders services in
accordance with the application requirements.

CVOs enable the reuse of existing VOs outside
their initial context and domain. Besides this
role of fostering aggregation of VOs into more
complex services, once created, CVOs are meant
to maintain their performance and self-reconfig-
ure as the context changes, giving our framework
better levels of resilience/reliability.

As said before, CVOs allow finding the opti-
mal possible way to deliver the application, given
both the capabilities offered by VOs and the
application requirements. The piece of the jig-
saw that completes our framework is the one
that provides the functionality of deriving the so-
called service logic, which represents the transla-
tion of the stakeholder/application requirements
into services to be fulfilled by the CVO level.
This addresses the need to reduce complexity
levels  for  the  users  of  the  platform.  Each
requested service is accompanied with specific
quality of service (QoS) requirements to further
address resilience. 

This level completes the description of how
we equipped our framework to fulfil the three
issues identified earlier. The three distinct con-
ceptual levels of our framework, — VO level,
CVO level, and service level — are illustrated in
Fig. 1.

COGNITION AND PROXIMITY

The main difference of the proposed framework
with respect to existing or past efforts is that cog-
nitive technologies are enabled with the intention
of supporting how we address the key issues high-
lighted above. Cognition is transversal to all three
levels. At the VO level, cognition is used for the
self-management and self-configuration of VOs in
order to maintain a constant link to the relevant
RWOs and manage the relevant data flows. More
precisely, envisioned cognition includes optimiza-
tion techniques to select more appropriate links
with RWOs, as well as learning techniques to pre-
dict problematic links, propose alternate links,
and generate knowledge from data.

At the CVO level, cognition is used in order
to decide on the VOs and CVOs that should be
(re)used to meet the application requirements.
CVOs are self-managed self-configurable objects
that are created dynamically in an autonomous
manner. First, techniques to acquire situation
information (e.g., monitoring relevant VOs and
their associated RWOs) are crucial, so as to dis-
cover VOs/CVOs and exploit their capabilities.
Moreover, learning techniques for predicting
future situations are also helpful in this direc-

Another vital con-
cept of the frame-
work is the notion of
proximity. Proximity
denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of
relatedness between
any IoT application
and the relevant

objects that may be
used to deliver this.

how close (hence

useful) objects are to

tion. Pattern recognition techniques are then
used to identify if an already existing CVO can
be (re)used for the current application. Other-
wise, optimization techniques are exploited
afresh for the optimal CVO (re)configuration
and selection of CVOs and VOs taking into
account user preferences and the current situa-
tion. The optimization process is aided by learn-
ing techniques for both the prioritization of
candidate CVOs or VOs and the exploitation of
the knowledge they built in past similar situa-
tions. An example of such knowledge derivation
is the learning related to the efficiency of CVO
(re)configuration.

Cognition at the service level is a prerequisite
in order to capture the application requirements
and then guide the selection process at the CVO
level. Semantic reasoning is used for the auto-
matic translation of a user request to a well
formed request for a service, understandable by
the system. Learning techniques build knowledge
of user preferences and eventually act on behalf
of the user. Finally, derivation and management
of information related to policies, that is, con-
straints imposed on the CVO by the administra-
tive domain in which the user is currently located
(set of permissible VOs, priorities for the use of
certain VOs, security related aspects), are strong-
ly required.

Building cognition should not spoil but needs
to coexist with security and privacy features. In the
proposed framework, security and privacy are
mainly considered through authentication and
access control. Authentication provides the means
to validate the identity of the user before s/he
interacts with the system. Access control is used to
regulate access to data and services (through
access 
corresponding  VOs/
CVOs). In this respect, VOs/CVOs are created
and managed with their associated policies and
access rights, which define when, how, and to what
extent the enclosed data/function can be disclosed.
The VOs/CVOs can be accessible only by authen-
ticated parties, which are authorized and granted

to 

the 

with the appropriate level of access according to
their role, even if the VOs/CVOs are distributed
across untrusted networks and domains.

Another vital concept of the framework is the
notion of proximity. Proximity denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of relatedness between any
IoT application and the relevant objects that may
be used to deliver this. The actual problem is
about assessing how close (hence useful) objects
are to users/applications. While the current trend
is to assess how close objects descriptions or data
stored in different databases can be, the differen-
tiation of the framework is toward an effort to
bring  a  much  more  “application-oriented”
approach. Thus, the distance the system wishes
to assess is not necessarily only between objects,
but between users/applications and objects.
Undoubtedly, the proximity is a prerequisite for
achieving more automatic and scalable solutions
in the cognitive selection of VOs/CVOs. 

Figure 2 depicts a technical view of the pro-
posed framework. RWOs are represented by
several colors and shapes, highlighting their het-
erogeneity. One level above, VO/CVO levels are
depicted  as  uniformly  colored  and  shaped
objects. Finally, at the top level, several objects
are selected to be used by a specific application
through the corresponding VOs/CVOs based on
proximity. For illustration purposes, the applica-
tion is considered to aggregate the objects by a
criterion related to either their shape or their
color. The cognition at the VO level as described
above is related to the Cognitive.prep property
allowing prepping the data with which to initially
enrich the VO. The automatic selection of the
most appropriate objects among the available
ones for the purpose of an application is repre-
sented by the Cognitive.select property. This
cognition could be split between the CVO level
and the service level. Proximity is used by the
Cognitive.select process.

As illustrated by the figure, the concepts of
VOs/CVOs are primarily targeted to the abstrac-
tion of heterogeneity. This is first achieved by a

ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to
substantially support sustainable development of
future smart cities. This article identifies the
main issues that may prevent IoT from playing
this crucial role, such as the heterogeneity among
connected objects and the unreliable nature of
associated services. To solve these issues, a cog-
nitive management framework for IoT is pro-
posed, in which dynamically changing real-world
objects are represented in a virtualized environ-
ment, and where cognition and proximity are
used to select the most relevant objects for the
purpose of an application in an intelligent and
autonomic way. Part of the framework is instan-
tiated in terms of building blocks and demon-
strated  through  a  smart  city  scenario  that
horizontally spans several application domains.
This preliminary proof of concept reveals the
high potential that self-reconfigurable IoT can
achieve in the context of smart cities.

INTRODUCTION

Urban living already poses major challenges in
our daily lives. The United Nations Population
Fund forecasts that by 2030 approximately 60
percent of the world population will live in an
urban environment, while 27 megacities with
greater than 10 million people are anticipated to
exist [1]. Therefore, urgent solutions are sought
for viable living conditions and sustainable city
development. On the other hand, the tremen-
dous development of information and communi-
cations technologies (ICT) and the power of the
Internet may help us see the light at the end of
the tunnel.

Even at present, we can hardly imagine our
life without the Internet. With more and more
connected objects becoming available, it will be

being used across application domains

(cid:129) Availability of a wide set of predefined ser-

even harder to imagine that the Internet we use
today to reach people, find information, and
assist us in our daily lives with innovative ser-
vices will not be extended toward creating value
out of such increased availability of connected
objects. This article is about helping to achieve
that transition from the Internet of People to
the Internet of Things (IoT) for People, especial-
ly in the context of future smart cities.

According to the European Research Cluster
on the Internet of Things, IoT is a dynamic glob-
al self-configuring network infrastructure where
physical and virtual “things” are identifiable and
communicate with standard and interoperable
protocols. While it is anticipated that IoT will be
the great hope of sustainable city life [2], the evi-
dence on how this will be achieved is not so
straightforward because of:

Within this contextual background we pro-
pose a cognitive management framework that
aims at showing, besides the widely addressed
issue of how objects should be connected, why
and when objects need to be connected, and
what value they can bring in enhancing existing
services and applications.

To this effect, the proposed framework focus-
es mainly on four axes: how we plan to hide het-
erogeneity of connected objects, how we ensure
resilience (ability to deliver service that can be
justifiably trusted in spite of continuous changes)
of dynamic service provisioning, how we instruct
systems to assess proximity (metric of relevance)
between IoT applications and “useful” objects,
and how the use of cognitive technologies [3]

mizing users’ intervention. Moreover, some
experimental evidence to support the theory
behind our proposed framework is provided. 

RELATED WORK

The previous section has identified the hetero-
geneity of objects and the need for resilience as
main challenges to be addressed by IoT in the
effort for a sustainable smart city, while it has
also introduced proximity and cognition as

FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

CONCEPTS

This effort proposes a cognitive management
framework for IoT that addresses the main
issues identified above:
(cid:129) The considerable number of objects that fall
within the scope of any IoT applications
and their heterogeneity

(cid:129) The inherently unreliable nature of such
objects and the guarantee of the end-to-end
resilience

(cid:129) The complexity associated with the huge
quantities of usable objects in a smart city
context

To this end we have identified the need to sup-
port end users and application providers with
techniques that can automatically select by rele-
vance all potential objects discovered to be avail-
able for use and able to meet given application
requirements. The cornerstone of the framework
is the concept of the virtual object (VO). A VO
is a virtual representation of any real-world
object (RWO), which thus becomes virtually
“always on.” VOs can be dynamically created
and destroyed, and they are dynamic objects
since  they  represent  dynamically  changing
RWOs.

In order to further enhance the resilience
capability, as well as offer an automated ability
to aggregate VOs to meet application require-
ments, the framework introduces the composite
VO  (CVO)  concept.  A  CVO  is  a  cognitive
mashup of semantically interoperable VOs (and
their offered services) that renders services in
accordance with the application requirements.

CVOs enable the reuse of existing VOs outside
their initial context and domain. Besides this
role of fostering aggregation of VOs into more
complex services, once created, CVOs are meant
to maintain their performance and self-reconfig-
ure as the context changes, giving our framework
better levels of resilience/reliability.

This addresses the need to reduce complexity
levels  for  the  users  of  the  platform.  Each
requested service is accompanied with specific
quality of service (QoS) requirements to further
address resilience. 

This level completes the description of how
we equipped our framework to fulfil the three
issues identified earlier. The three distinct con-
ceptual levels of our framework, — VO level,
CVO level, and service level — are illustrated in
Fig. 1.

The main difference of the proposed framework
with respect to existing or past efforts is that cog-

used to identify if an already existing CVO can
be (re)used for the current application. Other-
wise, optimization techniques are exploited
afresh for the optimal CVO (re)configuration
and selection of CVOs and VOs taking into
account user preferences and the current situa-
tion. The optimization process is aided by learn-
ing techniques for both the prioritization of
candidate CVOs or VOs and the exploitation of
the knowledge they built in past similar situa-
tions. An example of such knowledge derivation
is the learning related to the efficiency of CVO

Cognition at the service level is a prerequisite
in order to capture the application requirements
and then guide the selection process at the CVO
level. Semantic reasoning is used for the auto-
matic translation of a user request to a well
formed request for a service, understandable by
the system. Learning techniques build knowledge
of user preferences and eventually act on behalf
of the user. Finally, derivation and management
of information related to policies, that is, con-
straints imposed on the CVO by the administra-
tive domain in which the user is currently located
(set of permissible VOs, priorities for the use of
certain VOs, security related aspects), are strong-
ly required.

Building cognition should not spoil but needs
to coexist with security and privacy features. In the
proposed framework, security and privacy are
mainly considered through authentication and

to validate the identity of the user before s/he

their role, even if the VOs/CVOs are distributed

Another vital concept of the framework is the
notion of proximity. Proximity denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of relatedness between any
IoT application and the relevant objects that may
be used to deliver this. The actual problem is
about assessing how close (hence useful) objects
are to users/applications. While the current trend
is to assess how close objects descriptions or data
stored in different databases can be, the differen-
tiation of the framework is toward an effort to
bring  a  much  more  “application-oriented”
approach. Thus, the distance the system wishes
to assess is not necessarily only between objects,
but between users/applications and objects.
Undoubtedly, the proximity is a prerequisite for
achieving more automatic and scalable solutions
in the cognitive selection of VOs/CVOs. 

Figure 2 depicts a technical view of the pro-
posed framework. RWOs are represented by
several colors and shapes, highlighting their het-
erogeneity. One level above, VO/CVO levels are
depicted  as  uniformly  colored  and  shaped
objects. Finally, at the top level, several objects
are selected to be used by a specific application
through the corresponding VOs/CVOs based on
proximity. For illustration purposes, the applica-
tion is considered to aggregate the objects by a
criterion related to either their shape or their
color. The cognition at the VO level as described
above is related to the Cognitive.prep property
allowing prepping the data with which to initially
enrich the VO. The automatic selection of the
most appropriate objects among the available
ones for the purpose of an application is repre-
sented by the Cognitive.select property. This
cognition could be split between the CVO level
and the service level. Proximity is used by the
Cognitive.select process.

As illustrated by the figure, the concepts of
VOs/CVOs are primarily targeted to the abstrac-
tion of heterogeneity. This is first achieved by a

As stated before, VOs/CVOs are dynamic, self-

requirements. In such a way, they guarantee the

FRAMEWORK INSTANTIATION

The previous section illustrated a set of prob-
lems we found to be relevant to future smart
cities and presented an IoT-based cognitive con-

ceptual framework designed to address them. In
this section, we illustrate how such a framework
has been instantiated (Fig. 3). For this purpose,
a representative set of cognitive functions and
components were selected to be implemented as
building blocks in the various framework levels,
and their role is illustrated hereafter.

SERVICE-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The users use appropriate interfaces (which are
left outside the scope of this specific work) after
being authenticated/authorized in order to pro-

which are then conveyed to Application Transla-

reasoning for the automatic translation of a user
request into a language the system understands.
The application requirements are mapped to
request parameters (e.g., requested functions),
taking into account both the user-provided and
local policies.

Then Situation Acquisition is responsible for
deriving the situation associated with the request.

ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to
substantially support sustainable development of
future smart cities. This article identifies the
main issues that may prevent IoT from playing
this crucial role, such as the heterogeneity among
connected objects and the unreliable nature of
associated services. To solve these issues, a cog-
nitive management framework for IoT is pro-
posed, in which dynamically changing real-world
objects are represented in a virtualized environ-
ment, and where cognition and proximity are
used to select the most relevant objects for the
purpose of an application in an intelligent and
autonomic way. Part of the framework is instan-
tiated in terms of building blocks and demon-
strated  through  a  smart  city  scenario  that
horizontally spans several application domains.
This preliminary proof of concept reveals the
high potential that self-reconfigurable IoT can
achieve in the context of smart cities.

INTRODUCTION

Urban living already poses major challenges in
our daily lives. The United Nations Population
Fund forecasts that by 2030 approximately 60
percent of the world population will live in an
urban environment, while 27 megacities with
greater than 10 million people are anticipated to
exist [1]. Therefore, urgent solutions are sought
for viable living conditions and sustainable city
development. On the other hand, the tremen-
dous development of information and communi-
cations technologies (ICT) and the power of the
Internet may help us see the light at the end of
the tunnel.

Even at present, we can hardly imagine our
life without the Internet. With more and more
connected objects becoming available, it will be

being used across application domains

(cid:129) Availability of a wide set of predefined ser-

even harder to imagine that the Internet we use
today to reach people, find information, and
assist us in our daily lives with innovative ser-
vices will not be extended toward creating value
out of such increased availability of connected
objects. This article is about helping to achieve
that transition from the Internet of People to
the Internet of Things (IoT) for People, especial-
ly in the context of future smart cities.

According to the European Research Cluster
on the Internet of Things, IoT is a dynamic glob-
al self-configuring network infrastructure where
physical and virtual “things” are identifiable and
communicate with standard and interoperable
protocols. While it is anticipated that IoT will be
the great hope of sustainable city life [2], the evi-
dence on how this will be achieved is not so
straightforward because of:
(cid:129) Technological barriers among objects when

vices and applications
Within this contextual background we pro-
pose a cognitive management framework that
aims at showing, besides the widely addressed
issue of how objects should be connected, why
and when objects need to be connected, and
what value they can bring in enhancing existing
services and applications.

To this effect, the proposed framework focus-
es mainly on four axes: how we plan to hide het-
erogeneity of connected objects, how we ensure
resilience (ability to deliver service that can be
justifiably trusted in spite of continuous changes)
of dynamic service provisioning, how we instruct
systems to assess proximity (metric of relevance)
between IoT applications and “useful” objects,
and how the use of cognitive technologies [3]
(ability to dynamically select behavior through
self-management, taking into account informa-
tion and knowledge on the context of operation

as well as policies) offers intelligence while mini-
mizing users’ intervention. Moreover, some
experimental evidence to support the theory
behind our proposed framework is provided. 

RELATED WORK

The previous section has identified the hetero-
geneity of objects and the need for resilience as
main challenges to be addressed by IoT in the
effort for a sustainable smart city, while it has
also introduced proximity and cognition as
promising factors toward this direction.

In the scope of IoT, the virtualization of
objects and the use of semantics are the most
important assets for addressing the heterogene-
ity of objects. The authors in [4] use virtual sen-
sor abstraction in order to hide the complexity in
large-scale interconnected sensor networks. The
CONVERGENCE project (www.ict-conver-
gence.eu/) introduces a common container for
any kind of digital data, including representa-
tions of services, people, and real-world objects.
The EBBITS project (www.ebbits-project.eu/
news.php) aims at transforming every device into
a web service with semantic resolution. The
CASAGRAS project (www.iot-casagras.org/)
suggests the object’s identification in the physical
layer through the use of ontology instead of rep-
resentations.  However,  there  is  a  need  for
dynamic and intelligent virtual representation of
objects, which will allow them to become virtual-
ly “always on” in accordance with application
requirements and despite changing conditions.

Several efforts have been performed in the
field of resilience. In [5], the authors present a
taxonomy for threats and countermeasures with
respect  to  dependability  and  security.  The
ENISA study in [6] intends to provide end-to-
end consideration of resilience through an ontol-
ogy that encompasses different domains and
helps hide the heterogeneity of the underlying
infrastructure. In [7], a security framework is
presented that comprises mechanisms to achieve
intrusion detection and reaction. The work in [8]
focuses on enhancing the resilience of superviso-
ry control and data acquisition (SCADA) sys-
tems  against  cyber  attacks.  However,  the
majority of these efforts concern separate appli-
cation domains and rely on human intervention
in order to resolve problems. The means to
enhance the cross-domain resilience capability of
IoT, where a huge aggregation of objects and
vulnerabilities exist, in a dynamic and automated
way are strongly required.

The study of the similarity between two con-
cepts based on their information presents par-
ticular  research  interest.  The  effort  in  [9]
presents an estimation of semantic proximity
between  arbitrary  concepts  and  concept
instances, using the taxonomic knowledge con-
cepts. The authors in [10] develop a collabora-
tive and proximity-based mechanism for the
clustering of semantic web documents according
to their characteristics. Semantic models and a
web service for querying are used in [11] to sup-
port efficient service discovery, while service
selection using proximity-based ontology filter-
ing  is  proposed.  The  proximity  should  be
expanded  in  IoT  in  order  to  enhance  the

the framework is the
concept of the virtu-
al object. VOs are

tions of any real-

world object, which

description, discovery, and selection of objects
based on application requirements, moving from
proximity among objects to proximity between
users/applications and objects.

The research on cognitive management is
mainly focused on resource usage and architec-
tural efficiency in future networks. The effort
in [12] introduces cognitive and self-x princi-
ples in order to optimize the use of the radio
resources and spectrum in future networks.
The OneFit project (www.ict-onefit.eu/) com-
prises cognitive systems and opportunistic net-
works to achieve higher utilization of resources,
lower energy consumption, and reductions in
the total cost of ownership in the future Inter-
net. The UniverSelf project (www.univerself-
project.eu/) designs a unified management
framework for overcoming the management
complexity of future networking systems by
means of federation and self-management. The
introduction of cognitive management in IoT
will enable self-management and self-configu-
ration for the virtual representations of objects
and their (re)use in the context of dynamic ser-
vice provisioning.

Summarizing, the above references reveal
some issues related to how the current trends
address the heterogeneity of objects and the
need for resilience, while identifying that prox-
imity and cognitive management should expand
toward IoT to help smart city development.
These aspects are the motivation for our cogni-
tive framework, introduced in the next section.

FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

CONCEPTS

This effort proposes a cognitive management
framework for IoT that addresses the main
issues identified above:
(cid:129) The considerable number of objects that fall
within the scope of any IoT applications
and their heterogeneity

(cid:129) The inherently unreliable nature of such
objects and the guarantee of the end-to-end
resilience

(cid:129) The complexity associated with the huge
quantities of usable objects in a smart city
context

To this end we have identified the need to sup-
port end users and application providers with
techniques that can automatically select by rele-
vance all potential objects discovered to be avail-
able for use and able to meet given application
requirements. The cornerstone of the framework
is the concept of the virtual object (VO). A VO
is a virtual representation of any real-world
object (RWO), which thus becomes virtually
“always on.” VOs can be dynamically created
and destroyed, and they are dynamic objects
since  they  represent  dynamically  changing
RWOs.

In order to further enhance the resilience
capability, as well as offer an automated ability
to aggregate VOs to meet application require-
ments, the framework introduces the composite
VO  (CVO)  concept.  A  CVO  is  a  cognitive
mashup of semantically interoperable VOs (and
their offered services) that renders services in
accordance with the application requirements.

CVOs enable the reuse of existing VOs outside
their initial context and domain. Besides this
role of fostering aggregation of VOs into more
complex services, once created, CVOs are meant
to maintain their performance and self-reconfig-
ure as the context changes, giving our framework
better levels of resilience/reliability.

As said before, CVOs allow finding the opti-
mal possible way to deliver the application, given
both the capabilities offered by VOs and the
application requirements. The piece of the jig-
saw that completes our framework is the one
that provides the functionality of deriving the so-
called service logic, which represents the transla-
tion of the stakeholder/application requirements
into services to be fulfilled by the CVO level.
This addresses the need to reduce complexity
levels  for  the  users  of  the  platform.  Each
requested service is accompanied with specific
quality of service (QoS) requirements to further
address resilience. 

This level completes the description of how
we equipped our framework to fulfil the three
issues identified earlier. The three distinct con-
ceptual levels of our framework, — VO level,
CVO level, and service level — are illustrated in
Fig. 1.

COGNITION AND PROXIMITY

The main difference of the proposed framework
with respect to existing or past efforts is that cog-
nitive technologies are enabled with the intention
of supporting how we address the key issues high-
lighted above. Cognition is transversal to all three
levels. At the VO level, cognition is used for the
self-management and self-configuration of VOs in
order to maintain a constant link to the relevant
RWOs and manage the relevant data flows. More
precisely, envisioned cognition includes optimiza-
tion techniques to select more appropriate links
with RWOs, as well as learning techniques to pre-
dict problematic links, propose alternate links,
and generate knowledge from data.

At the CVO level, cognition is used in order
to decide on the VOs and CVOs that should be
(re)used to meet the application requirements.
CVOs are self-managed self-configurable objects
that are created dynamically in an autonomous
manner. First, techniques to acquire situation
information (e.g., monitoring relevant VOs and
their associated RWOs) are crucial, so as to dis-
cover VOs/CVOs and exploit their capabilities.
Moreover, learning techniques for predicting
future situations are also helpful in this direc-

Figure 2. Technical view of the proposed framework.

Another vital con-
cept of the frame-
work is the notion of
proximity. Proximity
denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of
relatedness between
any IoT application
and the relevant

objects that may be
used to deliver this.
The actual problem
is about assessing
how close (hence

useful) objects are to
users/applications.

tion. Pattern recognition techniques are then
used to identify if an already existing CVO can
be (re)used for the current application. Other-
wise, optimization techniques are exploited
afresh for the optimal CVO (re)configuration
and selection of CVOs and VOs taking into
account user preferences and the current situa-
tion. The optimization process is aided by learn-
ing techniques for both the prioritization of
candidate CVOs or VOs and the exploitation of
the knowledge they built in past similar situa-
tions. An example of such knowledge derivation
is the learning related to the efficiency of CVO
(re)configuration.

Cognition at the service level is a prerequisite
in order to capture the application requirements
and then guide the selection process at the CVO
level. Semantic reasoning is used for the auto-
matic translation of a user request to a well
formed request for a service, understandable by
the system. Learning techniques build knowledge
of user preferences and eventually act on behalf
of the user. Finally, derivation and management
of information related to policies, that is, con-
straints imposed on the CVO by the administra-
tive domain in which the user is currently located
(set of permissible VOs, priorities for the use of
certain VOs, security related aspects), are strong-
ly required.

Building cognition should not spoil but needs
to coexist with security and privacy features. In the
proposed framework, security and privacy are
mainly considered through authentication and
access control. Authentication provides the means
to validate the identity of the user before s/he
interacts with the system. Access control is used to
regulate access to data and services (through
access 
corresponding  VOs/
CVOs). In this respect, VOs/CVOs are created
and managed with their associated policies and
access rights, which define when, how, and to what
extent the enclosed data/function can be disclosed.
The VOs/CVOs can be accessible only by authen-
ticated parties, which are authorized and granted

to 

the 

with the appropriate level of access according to
their role, even if the VOs/CVOs are distributed
across untrusted networks and domains.

Another vital concept of the framework is the
notion of proximity. Proximity denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of relatedness between any
IoT application and the relevant objects that may
be used to deliver this. The actual problem is
about assessing how close (hence useful) objects
are to users/applications. While the current trend
is to assess how close objects descriptions or data
stored in different databases can be, the differen-
tiation of the framework is toward an effort to
bring  a  much  more  “application-oriented”
approach. Thus, the distance the system wishes
to assess is not necessarily only between objects,
but between users/applications and objects.
Undoubtedly, the proximity is a prerequisite for
achieving more automatic and scalable solutions
in the cognitive selection of VOs/CVOs. 

Figure 2 depicts a technical view of the pro-
posed framework. RWOs are represented by
several colors and shapes, highlighting their het-
erogeneity. One level above, VO/CVO levels are
depicted  as  uniformly  colored  and  shaped
objects. Finally, at the top level, several objects
are selected to be used by a specific application
through the corresponding VOs/CVOs based on
proximity. For illustration purposes, the applica-
tion is considered to aggregate the objects by a
criterion related to either their shape or their
color. The cognition at the VO level as described
above is related to the Cognitive.prep property
allowing prepping the data with which to initially
enrich the VO. The automatic selection of the
most appropriate objects among the available
ones for the purpose of an application is repre-
sented by the Cognitive.select property. This
cognition could be split between the CVO level
and the service level. Proximity is used by the
Cognitive.select process.

As illustrated by the figure, the concepts of
VOs/CVOs are primarily targeted to the abstrac-
tion of heterogeneity. This is first achieved by a

uniform way of representation through seman-
tics. Semantics are used for the specification and
high-level description, registration, discovery,
and access/invocation of existing VOs and CVOs.
As stated before, VOs/CVOs are dynamic, self-
aware, self-managed, and self-configurable
objects that adapt their own operation, even
their own configuration, based on the continu-
ously changing situation related to the underly-
ing  objects  and  overlying  application
requirements. In such a way, they guarantee the
resilience of the application in terms of availabil-
ity, performance, and dependability, and there-
fore of the constituent services. Moreover, CVOs
abstract the domain dependence by allowing the
reuse of VOs outside their initial domain and
offer end-to-end resilience.

FRAMEWORK INSTANTIATION

The previous section illustrated a set of prob-
lems we found to be relevant to future smart
cities and presented an IoT-based cognitive con-

ceptual framework designed to address them. In
this section, we illustrate how such a framework
has been instantiated (Fig. 3). For this purpose,
a representative set of cognitive functions and
components were selected to be implemented as
building blocks in the various framework levels,
and their role is illustrated hereafter.

SERVICE-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The users use appropriate interfaces (which are
left outside the scope of this specific work) after
being authenticated/authorized in order to pro-
vide their application requirements and policies,
which are then conveyed to Application Transla-
tion. This mechanism represents the semantic
reasoning for the automatic translation of a user
request into a language the system understands.
The application requirements are mapped to
request parameters (e.g., requested functions),
taking into account both the user-provided and
local policies.

Then Situation Acquisition is responsible for
deriving the situation associated with the request.

106

IEEE Communications Magazine (cid:129) June 2013

VLACHEAS LAYOUT_Layout 1  5/30/13  4:52 PM  Page 107

The situation is acquired in terms of situation
parameters, which enable the system to be
aware, as well as to foresee potential changes.
The situation parameters may include informa-
tion such as the time of day, the location of
interest, and the available VOs at that time and
place. The situation parameters are combined
with the request parameters, which helps maxi-
mize the reliability of the framework due to
more sophisticated and aware decisions at the
lower levels of the framework.

CVO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

Once the request and situation parameters are
retrieved, the framework needs to check how it
can address those requirements. Request and
Situation Matching (RSM) first performs a
search in order to discover potentially available,
relevant CVOs that can be reused. For this pur-
pose, RSM compares the request and situation
parameters with the corresponding recorded
parameters in the CVO registry (a registry where
logged CVOs are stored) using a satisfaction-
rate-based similarity metric (proximity), reflect-
ing the Euclidean distance between them. If
there is a matching of a satisfactory percentage,
RSM triggers the re-instantiation of existing
CVOs in order to be executed. If not matching
found, then the CVO should be created from
scratch.

In this case, RSM forwards the parameters to
Decision Making (DM) with a proposal of avail-
able VOs derived based on proximity that might
fit the parameters. First, DM interacts with the
VO registry (a registry where logged VOs are
stored with their semantic annotations, which
are used here for an automatic selection pro-
cess) in order to get information about these
VOs (discovery). Then DM selects the appropri-
ate VOs that should be composed for the cre-
ation of the CVO (optimization techniques
discussed earlier). DM registers the new CVO in
the CVO registry and then activates it.

The CVO Registry contains information for
each deployed CVO, which is preserved for a
specific time period. This information includes:
(cid:129) CVO identifier
(cid:129) Request parameters that led to the creation

of the CVO

(cid:129) Situation parameters that represent the con-

text in which the CVO was created

(cid:129) Access rights of the CVO
(cid:129) The VOs that comprise the CVO
The CVO registry is implemented and accessible
similar to the VO registry, as explained later.

Access Control can impose that only the
(C)VOs that can be accessed by a user/applica-
tion appear after a lookup in the (C)VO reg-
istry.

VO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The VO is the virtual representation of an ICT
object (supporting ICT capabilities such as a
smartphone or sensor) that may be associated
with one or more non-ICT objects (e.g., persons,
places). Both ICT and non-ICT objects are
RWOs. The information regarding the VO is
semantically enriched by adding contextual
information (metadata) through learning tech-
niques and the use of ontology that helps assess

Apart from running
instances of VOs, the
VO level comprises
the VO registries,
which store the

semantically enriched
data that are used
for the description of
the VOs, in order to
be available any time
from anywhere for

the authorized 

parties.

proximity in the selection of relevant objects.
VOs are implemented as web resources using
RESTful Web Services, shortlisted for the wide
applicability domain. The VO communicates
with the ICT object, either directly or by means
of a gateway, using the REST interface over var-
ious wireless or wired access technologies. The
communication between the ICT object and the
gateway in the second case (or even inside a net-
work of ICT objects connected to a VO through
a gateway) can be realized by different types of
communication technology standards, such as
universal plug and play (UPnP), open metering
system (OMS), data over cable service interface
specifications  (DOCSIS),  and  machine-to-
machine (M2M) communication.

Apart from running instances of VOs, the
VO level comprises the VO registries, which
store the semantically enriched data that are
used for the description of the VOs, in order to
be available any time from anywhere for the
authorized parties. The stored information may
include VO identifier, associations with ICT and
non-ICT objects, location, offered functions, and
access  rights  of  the  VO.  The  semantically
enriched  data  of  the  VOs  are  written  in
Resource Description Framework (RDF) [13],
which was designed as a model for representing
metadata about web resources, and stored in the
RDF graph databases, which implement the VO
registries. VO and CVO registries may be dis-
tributed across several domains.

CASE STUDY AND VALIDATION

This section intends to demonstrate the use of
the proposed IoT cognitive framework and the
cross-application nature of objects in one smart
city scenario that horizontally connects several
application domains and, more specifically,
smart health/smart home/smart living, smart
transport, and public safety. Smart cities are
actually a real driver for connecting application
domains.

STORYLINE SUMMARY

This scenario refers to how the proposed frame-
work may be exploited to protect and facilitate
the daily life in the smart city. Sarah, an elderly
woman, has opted for an assisted living service
that is provided by a medical center. A doctor,
who monitors Sarah’s health remotely from the
medical center, receives an alarm that Sarah has
fainted. An ambulance is instructed to go to
assist Sarah. A smart driving application is used
by the ambulance to reach Sarah’s home as
quickly as possible.

ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to
substantially support sustainable development of
future smart cities. This article identifies the
main issues that may prevent IoT from playing
this crucial role, such as the heterogeneity among
connected objects and the unreliable nature of
associated services. To solve these issues, a cog-
nitive management framework for IoT is pro-
posed, in which dynamically changing real-world
objects are represented in a virtualized environ-
ment, and where cognition and proximity are
used to select the most relevant objects for the
purpose of an application in an intelligent and
autonomic way. Part of the framework is instan-
tiated in terms of building blocks and demon-
strated  through  a  smart  city  scenario  that
horizontally spans several application domains.
This preliminary proof of concept reveals the
high potential that self-reconfigurable IoT can
achieve in the context of smart cities.

INTRODUCTION

Urban living already poses major challenges in
our daily lives. The United Nations Population
Fund forecasts that by 2030 approximately 60
percent of the world population will live in an
urban environment, while 27 megacities with
greater than 10 million people are anticipated to
exist [1]. Therefore, urgent solutions are sought
for viable living conditions and sustainable city
development. On the other hand, the tremen-
dous development of information and communi-
cations technologies (ICT) and the power of the
Internet may help us see the light at the end of
the tunnel.

Even at present, we can hardly imagine our
life without the Internet. With more and more
connected objects becoming available, it will be

being used across application domains

(cid:129) Availability of a wide set of predefined ser-

even harder to imagine that the Internet we use
today to reach people, find information, and
assist us in our daily lives with innovative ser-
vices will not be extended toward creating value
out of such increased availability of connected
objects. This article is about helping to achieve
that transition from the Internet of People to
the Internet of Things (IoT) for People, especial-
ly in the context of future smart cities.

According to the European Research Cluster
on the Internet of Things, IoT is a dynamic glob-
al self-configuring network infrastructure where
physical and virtual “things” are identifiable and
communicate with standard and interoperable
protocols. While it is anticipated that IoT will be
the great hope of sustainable city life [2], the evi-
dence on how this will be achieved is not so
straightforward because of:

vices and applications
Within this contextual background we pro-
pose a cognitive management framework that
aims at showing, besides the widely addressed
issue of how objects should be connected, why
and when objects need to be connected, and
what value they can bring in enhancing existing
services and applications.

To this effect, the proposed framework focus-
es mainly on four axes: how we plan to hide het-
erogeneity of connected objects, how we ensure
resilience (ability to deliver service that can be
justifiably trusted in spite of continuous changes)
of dynamic service provisioning, how we instruct
systems to assess proximity (metric of relevance)
between IoT applications and “useful” objects,
and how the use of cognitive technologies [3]
(ability to dynamically select behavior through
self-management, taking into account informa-
tion and knowledge on the context of operation

as well as policies) offers intelligence while mini-
mizing users’ intervention. Moreover, some
experimental evidence to support the theory
behind our proposed framework is provided. 

RELATED WORK

The previous section has identified the hetero-
geneity of objects and the need for resilience as
main challenges to be addressed by IoT in the
effort for a sustainable smart city, while it has
also introduced proximity and cognition as
promising factors toward this direction.

In the scope of IoT, the virtualization of
objects and the use of semantics are the most
important assets for addressing the heterogene-
ity of objects. The authors in [4] use virtual sen-
sor abstraction in order to hide the complexity in
large-scale interconnected sensor networks. The
CONVERGENCE project (www.ict-conver-
gence.eu/) introduces a common container for
any kind of digital data, including representa-
tions of services, people, and real-world objects.
The EBBITS project (www.ebbits-project.eu/
news.php) aims at transforming every device into
a web service with semantic resolution. The
CASAGRAS project (www.iot-casagras.org/)
suggests the object’s identification in the physical
layer through the use of ontology instead of rep-
resentations.  However,  there  is  a  need  for
dynamic and intelligent virtual representation of
objects, which will allow them to become virtual-
ly “always on” in accordance with application
requirements and despite changing conditions.

Several efforts have been performed in the
field of resilience. In [5], the authors present a
taxonomy for threats and countermeasures with
respect  to  dependability  and  security.  The
ENISA study in [6] intends to provide end-to-
end consideration of resilience through an ontol-
ogy that encompasses different domains and
helps hide the heterogeneity of the underlying
infrastructure. In [7], a security framework is
presented that comprises mechanisms to achieve
intrusion detection and reaction. The work in [8]
focuses on enhancing the resilience of superviso-
ry control and data acquisition (SCADA) sys-
tems  against  cyber  attacks.  However,  the
majority of these efforts concern separate appli-
cation domains and rely on human intervention
in order to resolve problems. The means to
enhance the cross-domain resilience capability of
IoT, where a huge aggregation of objects and
vulnerabilities exist, in a dynamic and automated
way are strongly required.

The study of the similarity between two con-
cepts based on their information presents par-
ticular  research  interest.  The  effort  in  [9]
presents an estimation of semantic proximity
between  arbitrary  concepts  and  concept
instances, using the taxonomic knowledge con-
cepts. The authors in [10] develop a collabora-
tive and proximity-based mechanism for the
clustering of semantic web documents according
to their characteristics. Semantic models and a
web service for querying are used in [11] to sup-
port efficient service discovery, while service
selection using proximity-based ontology filter-
ing  is  proposed.  The  proximity  should  be
expanded  in  IoT  in  order  to  enhance  the

The cornerstone of
the framework is the
concept of the virtu-
al object. VOs are
virtual representa-
tions of any real-

world object, which

description, discovery, and selection of objects
based on application requirements, moving from
proximity among objects to proximity between
users/applications and objects.

The research on cognitive management is
mainly focused on resource usage and architec-
tural efficiency in future networks. The effort
in [12] introduces cognitive and self-x princi-
ples in order to optimize the use of the radio
resources and spectrum in future networks.
The OneFit project (www.ict-onefit.eu/) com-
prises cognitive systems and opportunistic net-
works to achieve higher utilization of resources,
lower energy consumption, and reductions in
the total cost of ownership in the future Inter-
net. The UniverSelf project (www.univerself-
project.eu/) designs a unified management
framework for overcoming the management
complexity of future networking systems by
means of federation and self-management. The
introduction of cognitive management in IoT
will enable self-management and self-configu-
ration for the virtual representations of objects
and their (re)use in the context of dynamic ser-
vice provisioning.

Summarizing, the above references reveal
some issues related to how the current trends
address the heterogeneity of objects and the
need for resilience, while identifying that prox-
imity and cognitive management should expand
toward IoT to help smart city development.
These aspects are the motivation for our cogni-
tive framework, introduced in the next section.

FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

CONCEPTS

This effort proposes a cognitive management
framework for IoT that addresses the main
issues identified above:
(cid:129) The considerable number of objects that fall
within the scope of any IoT applications
and their heterogeneity

(cid:129) The inherently unreliable nature of such
objects and the guarantee of the end-to-end
resilience

(cid:129) The complexity associated with the huge
quantities of usable objects in a smart city
context

To this end we have identified the need to sup-
port end users and application providers with
techniques that can automatically select by rele-
vance all potential objects discovered to be avail-
able for use and able to meet given application
requirements. The cornerstone of the framework
is the concept of the virtual object (VO). A VO
is a virtual representation of any real-world
object (RWO), which thus becomes virtually
“always on.” VOs can be dynamically created
and destroyed, and they are dynamic objects
since  they  represent  dynamically  changing
RWOs.

In order to further enhance the resilience
capability, as well as offer an automated ability
to aggregate VOs to meet application require-
ments, the framework introduces the composite
VO  (CVO)  concept.  A  CVO  is  a  cognitive
mashup of semantically interoperable VOs (and
their offered services) that renders services in
accordance with the application requirements.

CVOs enable the reuse of existing VOs outside
their initial context and domain. Besides this
role of fostering aggregation of VOs into more
complex services, once created, CVOs are meant
to maintain their performance and self-reconfig-
ure as the context changes, giving our framework
better levels of resilience/reliability.

As said before, CVOs allow finding the opti-
mal possible way to deliver the application, given
both the capabilities offered by VOs and the
application requirements. The piece of the jig-
saw that completes our framework is the one
that provides the functionality of deriving the so-
called service logic, which represents the transla-
tion of the stakeholder/application requirements
into services to be fulfilled by the CVO level.
This addresses the need to reduce complexity
levels  for  the  users  of  the  platform.  Each
requested service is accompanied with specific
quality of service (QoS) requirements to further
address resilience. 

This level completes the description of how
we equipped our framework to fulfil the three
issues identified earlier. The three distinct con-
ceptual levels of our framework, — VO level,
CVO level, and service level — are illustrated in
Fig. 1.

COGNITION AND PROXIMITY

The main difference of the proposed framework
with respect to existing or past efforts is that cog-
nitive technologies are enabled with the intention
of supporting how we address the key issues high-
lighted above. Cognition is transversal to all three
levels. At the VO level, cognition is used for the
self-management and self-configuration of VOs in
order to maintain a constant link to the relevant
RWOs and manage the relevant data flows. More
precisely, envisioned cognition includes optimiza-
tion techniques to select more appropriate links
with RWOs, as well as learning techniques to pre-
dict problematic links, propose alternate links,
and generate knowledge from data.

At the CVO level, cognition is used in order
to decide on the VOs and CVOs that should be
(re)used to meet the application requirements.
CVOs are self-managed self-configurable objects
that are created dynamically in an autonomous
manner. First, techniques to acquire situation
information (e.g., monitoring relevant VOs and
their associated RWOs) are crucial, so as to dis-
cover VOs/CVOs and exploit their capabilities.
Moreover, learning techniques for predicting
future situations are also helpful in this direc-

Figure 2. Technical view of the proposed framework.

Another vital con-
cept of the frame-
work is the notion of
proximity. Proximity
denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of
relatedness between
any IoT application
and the relevant

objects that may be
used to deliver this.
The actual problem
is about assessing
how close (hence

useful) objects are to
users/applications.

tion. Pattern recognition techniques are then
used to identify if an already existing CVO can
be (re)used for the current application. Other-
wise, optimization techniques are exploited
afresh for the optimal CVO (re)configuration
and selection of CVOs and VOs taking into
account user preferences and the current situa-
tion. The optimization process is aided by learn-
ing techniques for both the prioritization of
candidate CVOs or VOs and the exploitation of
the knowledge they built in past similar situa-
tions. An example of such knowledge derivation
is the learning related to the efficiency of CVO
(re)configuration.

Cognition at the service level is a prerequisite
in order to capture the application requirements
and then guide the selection process at the CVO
level. Semantic reasoning is used for the auto-
matic translation of a user request to a well
formed request for a service, understandable by
the system. Learning techniques build knowledge
of user preferences and eventually act on behalf
of the user. Finally, derivation and management
of information related to policies, that is, con-
straints imposed on the CVO by the administra-
tive domain in which the user is currently located
(set of permissible VOs, priorities for the use of
certain VOs, security related aspects), are strong-
ly required.

Building cognition should not spoil but needs
to coexist with security and privacy features. In the
proposed framework, security and privacy are
mainly considered through authentication and
access control. Authentication provides the means
to validate the identity of the user before s/he
interacts with the system. Access control is used to
regulate access to data and services (through
access 
corresponding  VOs/
CVOs). In this respect, VOs/CVOs are created
and managed with their associated policies and
access rights, which define when, how, and to what
extent the enclosed data/function can be disclosed.
The VOs/CVOs can be accessible only by authen-
ticated parties, which are authorized and granted

to 

the 

with the appropriate level of access according to
their role, even if the VOs/CVOs are distributed
across untrusted networks and domains.

Another vital concept of the framework is the
notion of proximity. Proximity denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of relatedness between any
IoT application and the relevant objects that may
be used to deliver this. The actual problem is
about assessing how close (hence useful) objects
are to users/applications. While the current trend
is to assess how close objects descriptions or data
stored in different databases can be, the differen-
tiation of the framework is toward an effort to
bring  a  much  more  “application-oriented”
approach. Thus, the distance the system wishes
to assess is not necessarily only between objects,
but between users/applications and objects.
Undoubtedly, the proximity is a prerequisite for
achieving more automatic and scalable solutions
in the cognitive selection of VOs/CVOs. 

Figure 2 depicts a technical view of the pro-
posed framework. RWOs are represented by
several colors and shapes, highlighting their het-
erogeneity. One level above, VO/CVO levels are
depicted  as  uniformly  colored  and  shaped
objects. Finally, at the top level, several objects
are selected to be used by a specific application
through the corresponding VOs/CVOs based on
proximity. For illustration purposes, the applica-
tion is considered to aggregate the objects by a
criterion related to either their shape or their
color. The cognition at the VO level as described
above is related to the Cognitive.prep property
allowing prepping the data with which to initially
enrich the VO. The automatic selection of the
most appropriate objects among the available
ones for the purpose of an application is repre-
sented by the Cognitive.select property. This
cognition could be split between the CVO level
and the service level. Proximity is used by the
Cognitive.select process.

As illustrated by the figure, the concepts of
VOs/CVOs are primarily targeted to the abstrac-
tion of heterogeneity. This is first achieved by a

uniform way of representation through seman-
tics. Semantics are used for the specification and
high-level description, registration, discovery,
and access/invocation of existing VOs and CVOs.
As stated before, VOs/CVOs are dynamic, self-
aware, self-managed, and self-configurable
objects that adapt their own operation, even
their own configuration, based on the continu-
ously changing situation related to the underly-
ing  objects  and  overlying  application
requirements. In such a way, they guarantee the
resilience of the application in terms of availabil-
ity, performance, and dependability, and there-
fore of the constituent services. Moreover, CVOs
abstract the domain dependence by allowing the
reuse of VOs outside their initial domain and
offer end-to-end resilience.

FRAMEWORK INSTANTIATION

The previous section illustrated a set of prob-
lems we found to be relevant to future smart
cities and presented an IoT-based cognitive con-

ceptual framework designed to address them. In
this section, we illustrate how such a framework
has been instantiated (Fig. 3). For this purpose,
a representative set of cognitive functions and
components were selected to be implemented as
building blocks in the various framework levels,
and their role is illustrated hereafter.

SERVICE-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The users use appropriate interfaces (which are
left outside the scope of this specific work) after
being authenticated/authorized in order to pro-
vide their application requirements and policies,
which are then conveyed to Application Transla-
tion. This mechanism represents the semantic
reasoning for the automatic translation of a user
request into a language the system understands.
The application requirements are mapped to
request parameters (e.g., requested functions),
taking into account both the user-provided and
local policies.

Then Situation Acquisition is responsible for
deriving the situation associated with the request.

106

IEEE Communications Magazine (cid:129) June 2013

VLACHEAS LAYOUT_Layout 1  5/30/13  4:52 PM  Page 107

The situation is acquired in terms of situation
parameters, which enable the system to be
aware, as well as to foresee potential changes.
The situation parameters may include informa-
tion such as the time of day, the location of
interest, and the available VOs at that time and
place. The situation parameters are combined
with the request parameters, which helps maxi-
mize the reliability of the framework due to
more sophisticated and aware decisions at the
lower levels of the framework.

CVO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

Once the request and situation parameters are
retrieved, the framework needs to check how it
can address those requirements. Request and
Situation Matching (RSM) first performs a
search in order to discover potentially available,
relevant CVOs that can be reused. For this pur-
pose, RSM compares the request and situation
parameters with the corresponding recorded
parameters in the CVO registry (a registry where
logged CVOs are stored) using a satisfaction-
rate-based similarity metric (proximity), reflect-
ing the Euclidean distance between them. If
there is a matching of a satisfactory percentage,
RSM triggers the re-instantiation of existing
CVOs in order to be executed. If not matching
found, then the CVO should be created from
scratch.

In this case, RSM forwards the parameters to
Decision Making (DM) with a proposal of avail-
able VOs derived based on proximity that might
fit the parameters. First, DM interacts with the
VO registry (a registry where logged VOs are
stored with their semantic annotations, which
are used here for an automatic selection pro-
cess) in order to get information about these
VOs (discovery). Then DM selects the appropri-
ate VOs that should be composed for the cre-
ation of the CVO (optimization techniques
discussed earlier). DM registers the new CVO in
the CVO registry and then activates it.

The CVO Registry contains information for
each deployed CVO, which is preserved for a
specific time period. This information includes:
(cid:129) CVO identifier
(cid:129) Request parameters that led to the creation

of the CVO

(cid:129) Situation parameters that represent the con-

text in which the CVO was created

(cid:129) Access rights of the CVO
(cid:129) The VOs that comprise the CVO
The CVO registry is implemented and accessible
similar to the VO registry, as explained later.

Access Control can impose that only the
(C)VOs that can be accessed by a user/applica-
tion appear after a lookup in the (C)VO reg-
istry.

VO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The VO is the virtual representation of an ICT
object (supporting ICT capabilities such as a
smartphone or sensor) that may be associated
with one or more non-ICT objects (e.g., persons,
places). Both ICT and non-ICT objects are
RWOs. The information regarding the VO is
semantically enriched by adding contextual
information (metadata) through learning tech-
niques and the use of ontology that helps assess

Apart from running
instances of VOs, the
VO level comprises
the VO registries,
which store the

semantically enriched
data that are used
for the description of
the VOs, in order to
be available any time
from anywhere for

the authorized 

parties.

proximity in the selection of relevant objects.
VOs are implemented as web resources using
RESTful Web Services, shortlisted for the wide
applicability domain. The VO communicates
with the ICT object, either directly or by means
of a gateway, using the REST interface over var-
ious wireless or wired access technologies. The
communication between the ICT object and the
gateway in the second case (or even inside a net-
work of ICT objects connected to a VO through
a gateway) can be realized by different types of
communication technology standards, such as
universal plug and play (UPnP), open metering
system (OMS), data over cable service interface
specifications  (DOCSIS),  and  machine-to-
machine (M2M) communication.

Apart from running instances of VOs, the
VO level comprises the VO registries, which
store the semantically enriched data that are
used for the description of the VOs, in order to
be available any time from anywhere for the
authorized parties. The stored information may
include VO identifier, associations with ICT and
non-ICT objects, location, offered functions, and
access  rights  of  the  VO.  The  semantically
enriched  data  of  the  VOs  are  written  in
Resource Description Framework (RDF) [13],
which was designed as a model for representing
metadata about web resources, and stored in the
RDF graph databases, which implement the VO
registries. VO and CVO registries may be dis-
tributed across several domains.

CASE STUDY AND VALIDATION

This section intends to demonstrate the use of
the proposed IoT cognitive framework and the
cross-application nature of objects in one smart
city scenario that horizontally connects several
application domains and, more specifically,
smart health/smart home/smart living, smart
transport, and public safety. Smart cities are
actually a real driver for connecting application
domains.

STORYLINE SUMMARY

This scenario refers to how the proposed frame-
work may be exploited to protect and facilitate
the daily life in the smart city. Sarah, an elderly
woman, has opted for an assisted living service
that is provided by a medical center. A doctor,
who monitors Sarah’s health remotely from the
medical center, receives an alarm that Sarah has
fainted. An ambulance is instructed to go to
assist Sarah. A smart driving application is used
by the ambulance to reach Sarah’s home as
quickly as possible.

PROOF OF CONCEPT DESCRIPTION

The storyline introduces three different smart
city application domains (smart health, public
safety, smart transport). The situation in each
domain requires a respective CVO:

Figure 4. Use case workﬂow.

The use case workflow is depicted in Fig. 4
and is consistent with the description mentioned
previously. The requested parameters (e.g.,
Sarah’s pulse, room temperature, alarms [in the
medical center and in the smart home] etc.) and
the situation parameters (Sarah’s location, time,
available VOs representing a body pulse sensor, a
temperature sensor, a fire alarm, etc.) are extract-
ed by Application Translation and Situation
Acquisition to be used for deriving the CVO in
the medical center. The scenario assumes that an
appropriate existing CVO cannot be found by
RSM, so DM selects the appropriate VOs and
triggers the creation of a new CVO. The fire
alarm is selected to play the role of the alarm in
the smart home based on proximity. This selec-
tion of an object to deliver an application require-
ment (“raise an alarm”) in an approximate way
(“make noise”) enhances the resilience of the ser-
vice offered by the CVO in the absence of more
appropriate objects. The CVO is then executed.

When Sarah faints, the CVO becomes aware
of the accident, since it receives periodic mea-
surements from the body pulse VO and com-
pares them with a predefined threshold. An
alarm is raised by the CVO in both the smart
home (fire alarm) and the medical center, the
latter being automatically transmitted to an
ambulance, potentially with some policies about
the seriousness of the incident. The ambulance

requests a CVO for smart driving in order to
find the best route to Sarah’s home and save
valuable time. RSM finds and instantiates an
existing CVO that matches the request. This
CVO receives input data from the Traffic Moni-
toring CVO in the police department, which
combines real-time data from different types of
sensors (e.g., cameras, gas sensors, magnetic
field sensors [MFSs]) and infers the traffic status
in the city’s streets. For instance, if the MFSs
detect many cars and the carbon dioxide levels
are higher than a value, it can infer that there is
a traffic jam in the specific area.

The implementation aspects are depicted in
Fig. 5. The emulated smart city includes the
smart home of Sarah, which is equipped with
actuators and sensors hosted by wireless sensor
network (WSN) platforms A and B, respectively.
The CVO in the medical center uses the Cosm
online database service in order to get the sen-
sor measurements from WSN platform B as well
as to send the actuator commands to WSN plat-
form A. In the smart city, there are various types
of sensors, which are connected through WSN
platform C using various access technologies
and/or communication protocols (ZigBee, Blue-
tooth, Wi-Fi, etc.) sharing their data. The CVO
in the police department receives data from the
distributed platforms of type C in order to infer
the traffic status in the city’s streets.

ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to
substantially support sustainable development of
future smart cities. This article identifies the
main issues that may prevent IoT from playing
this crucial role, such as the heterogeneity among
connected objects and the unreliable nature of
associated services. To solve these issues, a cog-
nitive management framework for IoT is pro-
posed, in which dynamically changing real-world
objects are represented in a virtualized environ-
ment, and where cognition and proximity are
used to select the most relevant objects for the
purpose of an application in an intelligent and
autonomic way. Part of the framework is instan-
tiated in terms of building blocks and demon-
strated  through  a  smart  city  scenario  that
horizontally spans several application domains.
This preliminary proof of concept reveals the
high potential that self-reconfigurable IoT can
achieve in the context of smart cities.

INTRODUCTION

Urban living already poses major challenges in
our daily lives. The United Nations Population
Fund forecasts that by 2030 approximately 60
percent of the world population will live in an
urban environment, while 27 megacities with
greater than 10 million people are anticipated to
exist [1]. Therefore, urgent solutions are sought
for viable living conditions and sustainable city
development. On the other hand, the tremen-
dous development of information and communi-
cations technologies (ICT) and the power of the
Internet may help us see the light at the end of
the tunnel.

Even at present, we can hardly imagine our
life without the Internet. With more and more
connected objects becoming available, it will be

being used across application domains

(cid:129) Availability of a wide set of predefined ser-

even harder to imagine that the Internet we use
today to reach people, find information, and
assist us in our daily lives with innovative ser-
vices will not be extended toward creating value
out of such increased availability of connected
objects. This article is about helping to achieve
that transition from the Internet of People to
the Internet of Things (IoT) for People, especial-
ly in the context of future smart cities.

According to the European Research Cluster
on the Internet of Things, IoT is a dynamic glob-
al self-configuring network infrastructure where
physical and virtual “things” are identifiable and
communicate with standard and interoperable
protocols. While it is anticipated that IoT will be
the great hope of sustainable city life [2], the evi-
dence on how this will be achieved is not so
straightforward because of:

Within this contextual background we pro-
pose a cognitive management framework that
aims at showing, besides the widely addressed
issue of how objects should be connected, why
and when objects need to be connected, and
what value they can bring in enhancing existing
services and applications.

To this effect, the proposed framework focus-
es mainly on four axes: how we plan to hide het-
erogeneity of connected objects, how we ensure
resilience (ability to deliver service that can be
justifiably trusted in spite of continuous changes)
of dynamic service provisioning, how we instruct
systems to assess proximity (metric of relevance)
between IoT applications and “useful” objects,
and how the use of cognitive technologies [3]
(ability to dynamically select behavior through
self-management, taking into account informa-
tion and knowledge on the context of operation

as well as policies) offers intelligence while mini-
mizing users’ intervention. Moreover, some
experimental evidence to support the theory
behind our proposed framework is provided. 

RELATED WORK

The previous section has identified the hetero-
geneity of objects and the need for resilience as
main challenges to be addressed by IoT in the
effort for a sustainable smart city, while it has
also introduced proximity and cognition as
promising factors toward this direction.

In the scope of IoT, the virtualization of
objects and the use of semantics are the most
important assets for addressing the heterogene-
ity of objects. The authors in [4] use virtual sen-
sor abstraction in order to hide the complexity in
large-scale interconnected sensor networks. The
CONVERGENCE project (www.ict-conver-
gence.eu/) introduces a common container for
any kind of digital data, including representa-
tions of services, people, and real-world objects.
The EBBITS project (www.ebbits-project.eu/
news.php) aims at transforming every device into
a web service with semantic resolution. The
CASAGRAS project (www.iot-casagras.org/)
suggests the object’s identification in the physical
layer through the use of ontology instead of rep-
resentations.  However,  there  is  a  need  for
dynamic and intelligent virtual representation of
objects, which will allow them to become virtual-
ly “always on” in accordance with application
requirements and despite changing conditions.

Several efforts have been performed in the
field of resilience. In [5], the authors present a
taxonomy for threats and countermeasures with
respect  to  dependability  and  security.  The
ENISA study in [6] intends to provide end-to-
end consideration of resilience through an ontol-
ogy that encompasses different domains and
helps hide the heterogeneity of the underlying
infrastructure. In [7], a security framework is
presented that comprises mechanisms to achieve
intrusion detection and reaction. The work in [8]
focuses on enhancing the resilience of superviso-
ry control and data acquisition (SCADA) sys-
tems  against  cyber  attacks.  However,  the
majority of these efforts concern separate appli-
cation domains and rely on human intervention
in order to resolve problems. The means to
enhance the cross-domain resilience capability of
IoT, where a huge aggregation of objects and
vulnerabilities exist, in a dynamic and automated
way are strongly required.

The study of the similarity between two con-
cepts based on their information presents par-
ticular  research  interest.  The  effort  in  [9]
presents an estimation of semantic proximity
between  arbitrary  concepts  and  concept
instances, using the taxonomic knowledge con-
cepts. The authors in [10] develop a collabora-
tive and proximity-based mechanism for the
clustering of semantic web documents according
to their characteristics. Semantic models and a
web service for querying are used in [11] to sup-
port efficient service discovery, while service
selection using proximity-based ontology filter-
ing  is  proposed.  The  proximity  should  be
expanded  in  IoT  in  order  to  enhance  the

the framework is the
concept of the virtu-
al object. VOs are
virtual representa-
tions of any real-

world object, which

description, discovery, and selection of objects
based on application requirements, moving from
proximity among objects to proximity between
users/applications and objects.

The research on cognitive management is
mainly focused on resource usage and architec-
tural efficiency in future networks. The effort
in [12] introduces cognitive and self-x princi-
ples in order to optimize the use of the radio
resources and spectrum in future networks.
The OneFit project (www.ict-onefit.eu/) com-
prises cognitive systems and opportunistic net-
works to achieve higher utilization of resources,
lower energy consumption, and reductions in
the total cost of ownership in the future Inter-
net. The UniverSelf project (www.univerself-
project.eu/) designs a unified management
framework for overcoming the management
complexity of future networking systems by
means of federation and self-management. The
introduction of cognitive management in IoT
will enable self-management and self-configu-
ration for the virtual representations of objects
and their (re)use in the context of dynamic ser-
vice provisioning.

Summarizing, the above references reveal
some issues related to how the current trends
address the heterogeneity of objects and the
need for resilience, while identifying that prox-
imity and cognitive management should expand
toward IoT to help smart city development.
These aspects are the motivation for our cogni-
tive framework, introduced in the next section.

FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

CONCEPTS

This effort proposes a cognitive management
framework for IoT that addresses the main
issues identified above:
(cid:129) The considerable number of objects that fall
within the scope of any IoT applications
and their heterogeneity

(cid:129) The inherently unreliable nature of such
objects and the guarantee of the end-to-end
resilience

(cid:129) The complexity associated with the huge
quantities of usable objects in a smart city
context

To this end we have identified the need to sup-
port end users and application providers with
techniques that can automatically select by rele-
vance all potential objects discovered to be avail-
able for use and able to meet given application
requirements. The cornerstone of the framework
is the concept of the virtual object (VO). A VO
is a virtual representation of any real-world
object (RWO), which thus becomes virtually
“always on.” VOs can be dynamically created
and destroyed, and they are dynamic objects
since  they  represent  dynamically  changing
RWOs.

In order to further enhance the resilience
capability, as well as offer an automated ability
to aggregate VOs to meet application require-
ments, the framework introduces the composite
VO  (CVO)  concept.  A  CVO  is  a  cognitive
mashup of semantically interoperable VOs (and
their offered services) that renders services in
accordance with the application requirements.

CVOs enable the reuse of existing VOs outside
their initial context and domain. Besides this
role of fostering aggregation of VOs into more
complex services, once created, CVOs are meant
to maintain their performance and self-reconfig-
ure as the context changes, giving our framework
better levels of resilience/reliability.

As said before, CVOs allow finding the opti-
mal possible way to deliver the application, given
both the capabilities offered by VOs and the
application requirements. The piece of the jig-
saw that completes our framework is the one
that provides the functionality of deriving the so-
called service logic, which represents the transla-
tion of the stakeholder/application requirements
into services to be fulfilled by the CVO level.
This addresses the need to reduce complexity
levels  for  the  users  of  the  platform.  Each
requested service is accompanied with specific
quality of service (QoS) requirements to further
address resilience. 

This level completes the description of how
we equipped our framework to fulfil the three
issues identified earlier. The three distinct con-
ceptual levels of our framework, — VO level,
CVO level, and service level — are illustrated in
Fig. 1.

COGNITION AND PROXIMITY

The main difference of the proposed framework
with respect to existing or past efforts is that cog-
nitive technologies are enabled with the intention
of supporting how we address the key issues high-
lighted above. Cognition is transversal to all three
levels. At the VO level, cognition is used for the
self-management and self-configuration of VOs in
order to maintain a constant link to the relevant
RWOs and manage the relevant data flows. More
precisely, envisioned cognition includes optimiza-
tion techniques to select more appropriate links
with RWOs, as well as learning techniques to pre-
dict problematic links, propose alternate links,
and generate knowledge from data.

At the CVO level, cognition is used in order
to decide on the VOs and CVOs that should be
(re)used to meet the application requirements.
CVOs are self-managed self-configurable objects
that are created dynamically in an autonomous
manner. First, techniques to acquire situation
information (e.g., monitoring relevant VOs and
their associated RWOs) are crucial, so as to dis-
cover VOs/CVOs and exploit their capabilities.
Moreover, learning techniques for predicting
future situations are also helpful in this direc-

Figure 2. Technical view of the proposed framework.

Another vital con-
cept of the frame-
work is the notion of
proximity. Proximity
denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of
relatedness between
any IoT application
and the relevant

objects that may be
used to deliver this.
The actual problem
is about assessing
how close (hence

useful) objects are to
users/applications.

tion. Pattern recognition techniques are then
used to identify if an already existing CVO can
be (re)used for the current application. Other-
wise, optimization techniques are exploited
afresh for the optimal CVO (re)configuration
and selection of CVOs and VOs taking into
account user preferences and the current situa-
tion. The optimization process is aided by learn-
ing techniques for both the prioritization of
candidate CVOs or VOs and the exploitation of
the knowledge they built in past similar situa-
tions. An example of such knowledge derivation
is the learning related to the efficiency of CVO
(re)configuration.

Cognition at the service level is a prerequisite
in order to capture the application requirements
and then guide the selection process at the CVO
level. Semantic reasoning is used for the auto-
matic translation of a user request to a well
formed request for a service, understandable by
the system. Learning techniques build knowledge
of user preferences and eventually act on behalf
of the user. Finally, derivation and management
of information related to policies, that is, con-
straints imposed on the CVO by the administra-
tive domain in which the user is currently located
(set of permissible VOs, priorities for the use of
certain VOs, security related aspects), are strong-
ly required.

Building cognition should not spoil but needs
to coexist with security and privacy features. In the
proposed framework, security and privacy are
mainly considered through authentication and
access control. Authentication provides the means
to validate the identity of the user before s/he
interacts with the system. Access control is used to
regulate access to data and services (through
access 
corresponding  VOs/
CVOs). In this respect, VOs/CVOs are created
and managed with their associated policies and
access rights, which define when, how, and to what
extent the enclosed data/function can be disclosed.
The VOs/CVOs can be accessible only by authen-
ticated parties, which are authorized and granted

to 

the 

with the appropriate level of access according to
their role, even if the VOs/CVOs are distributed
across untrusted networks and domains.

Another vital concept of the framework is the
notion of proximity. Proximity denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of relatedness between any
IoT application and the relevant objects that may
be used to deliver this. The actual problem is
about assessing how close (hence useful) objects
are to users/applications. While the current trend
is to assess how close objects descriptions or data
stored in different databases can be, the differen-
tiation of the framework is toward an effort to
bring  a  much  more  “application-oriented”
approach. Thus, the distance the system wishes
to assess is not necessarily only between objects,
but between users/applications and objects.
Undoubtedly, the proximity is a prerequisite for
achieving more automatic and scalable solutions
in the cognitive selection of VOs/CVOs. 

Figure 2 depicts a technical view of the pro-
posed framework. RWOs are represented by
several colors and shapes, highlighting their het-
erogeneity. One level above, VO/CVO levels are
depicted  as  uniformly  colored  and  shaped
objects. Finally, at the top level, several objects
are selected to be used by a specific application
through the corresponding VOs/CVOs based on
proximity. For illustration purposes, the applica-
tion is considered to aggregate the objects by a
criterion related to either their shape or their
color. The cognition at the VO level as described
above is related to the Cognitive.prep property
allowing prepping the data with which to initially
enrich the VO. The automatic selection of the
most appropriate objects among the available
ones for the purpose of an application is repre-
sented by the Cognitive.select property. This
cognition could be split between the CVO level
and the service level. Proximity is used by the
Cognitive.select process.

As illustrated by the figure, the concepts of
VOs/CVOs are primarily targeted to the abstrac-
tion of heterogeneity. This is first achieved by a

uniform way of representation through seman-
tics. Semantics are used for the specification and
high-level description, registration, discovery,
and access/invocation of existing VOs and CVOs.
As stated before, VOs/CVOs are dynamic, self-
aware, self-managed, and self-configurable
objects that adapt their own operation, even
their own configuration, based on the continu-
ously changing situation related to the underly-
ing  objects  and  overlying  application
requirements. In such a way, they guarantee the
resilience of the application in terms of availabil-
ity, performance, and dependability, and there-
fore of the constituent services. Moreover, CVOs
abstract the domain dependence by allowing the
reuse of VOs outside their initial domain and
offer end-to-end resilience.

FRAMEWORK INSTANTIATION

The previous section illustrated a set of prob-
lems we found to be relevant to future smart
cities and presented an IoT-based cognitive con-

ceptual framework designed to address them. In
this section, we illustrate how such a framework
has been instantiated (Fig. 3). For this purpose,
a representative set of cognitive functions and
components were selected to be implemented as
building blocks in the various framework levels,
and their role is illustrated hereafter.

SERVICE-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The users use appropriate interfaces (which are
left outside the scope of this specific work) after
being authenticated/authorized in order to pro-
vide their application requirements and policies,
which are then conveyed to Application Transla-
tion. This mechanism represents the semantic
reasoning for the automatic translation of a user
request into a language the system understands.
The application requirements are mapped to
request parameters (e.g., requested functions),
taking into account both the user-provided and
local policies.

Then Situation Acquisition is responsible for
deriving the situation associated with the request.

106

IEEE Communications Magazine (cid:129) June 2013

VLACHEAS LAYOUT_Layout 1  5/30/13  4:52 PM  Page 107

The situation is acquired in terms of situation
parameters, which enable the system to be
aware, as well as to foresee potential changes.
The situation parameters may include informa-
tion such as the time of day, the location of
interest, and the available VOs at that time and
place. The situation parameters are combined
with the request parameters, which helps maxi-
mize the reliability of the framework due to
more sophisticated and aware decisions at the
lower levels of the framework.

CVO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

Once the request and situation parameters are
retrieved, the framework needs to check how it
can address those requirements. Request and
Situation Matching (RSM) first performs a
search in order to discover potentially available,
relevant CVOs that can be reused. For this pur-
pose, RSM compares the request and situation
parameters with the corresponding recorded
parameters in the CVO registry (a registry where
logged CVOs are stored) using a satisfaction-
rate-based similarity metric (proximity), reflect-
ing the Euclidean distance between them. If
there is a matching of a satisfactory percentage,
RSM triggers the re-instantiation of existing
CVOs in order to be executed. If not matching
found, then the CVO should be created from
scratch.

In this case, RSM forwards the parameters to
Decision Making (DM) with a proposal of avail-
able VOs derived based on proximity that might
fit the parameters. First, DM interacts with the
VO registry (a registry where logged VOs are
stored with their semantic annotations, which
are used here for an automatic selection pro-
cess) in order to get information about these
VOs (discovery). Then DM selects the appropri-
ate VOs that should be composed for the cre-
ation of the CVO (optimization techniques
discussed earlier). DM registers the new CVO in
the CVO registry and then activates it.

The CVO Registry contains information for
each deployed CVO, which is preserved for a
specific time period. This information includes:
(cid:129) CVO identifier
(cid:129) Request parameters that led to the creation

of the CVO

(cid:129) Situation parameters that represent the con-

text in which the CVO was created

(cid:129) Access rights of the CVO
(cid:129) The VOs that comprise the CVO
The CVO registry is implemented and accessible
similar to the VO registry, as explained later.

Access Control can impose that only the
(C)VOs that can be accessed by a user/applica-
tion appear after a lookup in the (C)VO reg-
istry.

VO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The VO is the virtual representation of an ICT
object (supporting ICT capabilities such as a
smartphone or sensor) that may be associated
with one or more non-ICT objects (e.g., persons,
places). Both ICT and non-ICT objects are
RWOs. The information regarding the VO is
semantically enriched by adding contextual
information (metadata) through learning tech-
niques and the use of ontology that helps assess

Apart from running
instances of VOs, the
VO level comprises
the VO registries,
which store the

semantically enriched
data that are used
for the description of
the VOs, in order to
be available any time
from anywhere for

the authorized 

parties.

proximity in the selection of relevant objects.
VOs are implemented as web resources using
RESTful Web Services, shortlisted for the wide
applicability domain. The VO communicates
with the ICT object, either directly or by means
of a gateway, using the REST interface over var-
ious wireless or wired access technologies. The
communication between the ICT object and the
gateway in the second case (or even inside a net-
work of ICT objects connected to a VO through
a gateway) can be realized by different types of
communication technology standards, such as
universal plug and play (UPnP), open metering
system (OMS), data over cable service interface
specifications  (DOCSIS),  and  machine-to-
machine (M2M) communication.

Apart from running instances of VOs, the
VO level comprises the VO registries, which
store the semantically enriched data that are
used for the description of the VOs, in order to
be available any time from anywhere for the
authorized parties. The stored information may
include VO identifier, associations with ICT and
non-ICT objects, location, offered functions, and
access  rights  of  the  VO.  The  semantically
enriched  data  of  the  VOs  are  written  in
Resource Description Framework (RDF) [13],
which was designed as a model for representing
metadata about web resources, and stored in the
RDF graph databases, which implement the VO
registries. VO and CVO registries may be dis-
tributed across several domains.

CASE STUDY AND VALIDATION

This section intends to demonstrate the use of
the proposed IoT cognitive framework and the
cross-application nature of objects in one smart
city scenario that horizontally connects several
application domains and, more specifically,
smart health/smart home/smart living, smart
transport, and public safety. Smart cities are
actually a real driver for connecting application
domains.

STORYLINE SUMMARY

This scenario refers to how the proposed frame-
work may be exploited to protect and facilitate
the daily life in the smart city. Sarah, an elderly
woman, has opted for an assisted living service
that is provided by a medical center. A doctor,
who monitors Sarah’s health remotely from the
medical center, receives an alarm that Sarah has
fainted. An ambulance is instructed to go to
assist Sarah. A smart driving application is used
by the ambulance to reach Sarah’s home as
quickly as possible.

PROOF OF CONCEPT DESCRIPTION

The storyline introduces three different smart
city application domains (smart health, public
safety, smart transport). The situation in each
domain requires a respective CVO:

Figure 4. Use case workﬂow.

The use case workflow is depicted in Fig. 4
and is consistent with the description mentioned
previously. The requested parameters (e.g.,
Sarah’s pulse, room temperature, alarms [in the
medical center and in the smart home] etc.) and
the situation parameters (Sarah’s location, time,
available VOs representing a body pulse sensor, a
temperature sensor, a fire alarm, etc.) are extract-
ed by Application Translation and Situation
Acquisition to be used for deriving the CVO in
the medical center. The scenario assumes that an
appropriate existing CVO cannot be found by
RSM, so DM selects the appropriate VOs and
triggers the creation of a new CVO. The fire
alarm is selected to play the role of the alarm in
the smart home based on proximity. This selec-
tion of an object to deliver an application require-
ment (“raise an alarm”) in an approximate way
(“make noise”) enhances the resilience of the ser-
vice offered by the CVO in the absence of more
appropriate objects. The CVO is then executed.

When Sarah faints, the CVO becomes aware
of the accident, since it receives periodic mea-
surements from the body pulse VO and com-
pares them with a predefined threshold. An
alarm is raised by the CVO in both the smart
home (fire alarm) and the medical center, the
latter being automatically transmitted to an
ambulance, potentially with some policies about
the seriousness of the incident. The ambulance

requests a CVO for smart driving in order to
find the best route to Sarah’s home and save
valuable time. RSM finds and instantiates an
existing CVO that matches the request. This
CVO receives input data from the Traffic Moni-
toring CVO in the police department, which
combines real-time data from different types of
sensors (e.g., cameras, gas sensors, magnetic
field sensors [MFSs]) and infers the traffic status
in the city’s streets. For instance, if the MFSs
detect many cars and the carbon dioxide levels
are higher than a value, it can infer that there is
a traffic jam in the specific area.

The implementation aspects are depicted in
Fig. 5. The emulated smart city includes the
smart home of Sarah, which is equipped with
actuators and sensors hosted by wireless sensor
network (WSN) platforms A and B, respectively.
The CVO in the medical center uses the Cosm
online database service in order to get the sen-
sor measurements from WSN platform B as well
as to send the actuator commands to WSN plat-
form A. In the smart city, there are various types
of sensors, which are connected through WSN
platform C using various access technologies
and/or communication protocols (ZigBee, Blue-
tooth, Wi-Fi, etc.) sharing their data. The CVO
in the police department receives data from the
distributed platforms of type C in order to infer
the traffic status in the city’s streets.

For the performance evaluation of the frame-
work, we have conducted an indicative experi-
ment. The application requests a service that
consists of four functions (which represent the
request parameters). The service execution time
for different numbers of available objects that
are located in the area of interest is presented in
Fig. 6 for three cases. The first one corresponds
to the lack of the framework with respect to cog-
nition/proximity at the CVO level using an
exhaustive search technique for selecting the
appropriate objects (case A), the second one to
CVO creation through the DM process using the
CPLEX algorithm [14] (case B), and the last one
to the CVO instantiation (reuse of an existing
CVO) through the RSM process based on rank-
ing CVO records according to a satisfaction rate
similarity metric (case C). As depicted, the ser-
vice execution time is decreased through DM,
while further time savings are achieved through
RSM, showing that cognition/proximity can
decrease operational expenditures (OPEX).

The benefits of the framework can be sum-

marized as follows:

ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to
substantially support sustainable development of
future smart cities. This article identifies the
main issues that may prevent IoT from playing
this crucial role, such as the heterogeneity among
connected objects and the unreliable nature of
associated services. To solve these issues, a cog-
nitive management framework for IoT is pro-
posed, in which dynamically changing real-world
objects are represented in a virtualized environ-
ment, and where cognition and proximity are
used to select the most relevant objects for the
purpose of an application in an intelligent and
autonomic way. Part of the framework is instan-
tiated in terms of building blocks and demon-
strated  through  a  smart  city  scenario  that
horizontally spans several application domains.
This preliminary proof of concept reveals the
high potential that self-reconfigurable IoT can
achieve in the context of smart cities.

INTRODUCTION

Urban living already poses major challenges in
our daily lives. The United Nations Population
Fund forecasts that by 2030 approximately 60
percent of the world population will live in an
urban environment, while 27 megacities with
greater than 10 million people are anticipated to
exist [1]. Therefore, urgent solutions are sought
for viable living conditions and sustainable city
development. On the other hand, the tremen-
dous development of information and communi-
cations technologies (ICT) and the power of the
Internet may help us see the light at the end of
the tunnel.

Even at present, we can hardly imagine our
life without the Internet. With more and more
connected objects becoming available, it will be

being used across application domains

(cid:129) Availability of a wide set of predefined ser-

even harder to imagine that the Internet we use
today to reach people, find information, and
assist us in our daily lives with innovative ser-
vices will not be extended toward creating value
out of such increased availability of connected
objects. This article is about helping to achieve
that transition from the Internet of People to
the Internet of Things (IoT) for People, especial-
ly in the context of future smart cities.

According to the European Research Cluster
on the Internet of Things, IoT is a dynamic glob-
al self-configuring network infrastructure where
physical and virtual “things” are identifiable and
communicate with standard and interoperable
protocols. While it is anticipated that IoT will be
the great hope of sustainable city life [2], the evi-
dence on how this will be achieved is not so
straightforward because of:
(cid:129) Technological barriers among objects when

vices and applications
Within this contextual background we pro-
pose a cognitive management framework that
aims at showing, besides the widely addressed
issue of how objects should be connected, why
and when objects need to be connected, and
what value they can bring in enhancing existing
services and applications.

To this effect, the proposed framework focus-
es mainly on four axes: how we plan to hide het-
erogeneity of connected objects, how we ensure
resilience (ability to deliver service that can be
justifiably trusted in spite of continuous changes)
of dynamic service provisioning, how we instruct
systems to assess proximity (metric of relevance)
between IoT applications and “useful” objects,
and how the use of cognitive technologies [3]
(ability to dynamically select behavior through
self-management, taking into account informa-
tion and knowledge on the context of operation

as well as policies) offers intelligence while mini-
mizing users’ intervention. Moreover, some
experimental evidence to support the theory
behind our proposed framework is provided. 

RELATED WORK

The previous section has identified the hetero-
geneity of objects and the need for resilience as
main challenges to be addressed by IoT in the
effort for a sustainable smart city, while it has
also introduced proximity and cognition as
promising factors toward this direction.

In the scope of IoT, the virtualization of
objects and the use of semantics are the most
important assets for addressing the heterogene-
ity of objects. The authors in [4] use virtual sen-
sor abstraction in order to hide the complexity in
large-scale interconnected sensor networks. The
CONVERGENCE project (www.ict-conver-
gence.eu/) introduces a common container for
any kind of digital data, including representa-
tions of services, people, and real-world objects.
The EBBITS project (www.ebbits-project.eu/
news.php) aims at transforming every device into
a web service with semantic resolution. The
CASAGRAS project (www.iot-casagras.org/)
suggests the object’s identification in the physical
layer through the use of ontology instead of rep-
resentations.  However,  there  is  a  need  for
dynamic and intelligent virtual representation of
objects, which will allow them to become virtual-
ly “always on” in accordance with application
requirements and despite changing conditions.

Several efforts have been performed in the
field of resilience. In [5], the authors present a
taxonomy for threats and countermeasures with
respect  to  dependability  and  security.  The
ENISA study in [6] intends to provide end-to-
end consideration of resilience through an ontol-
ogy that encompasses different domains and
helps hide the heterogeneity of the underlying
infrastructure. In [7], a security framework is
presented that comprises mechanisms to achieve
intrusion detection and reaction. The work in [8]
focuses on enhancing the resilience of superviso-
ry control and data acquisition (SCADA) sys-
tems  against  cyber  attacks.  However,  the
majority of these efforts concern separate appli-
cation domains and rely on human intervention
in order to resolve problems. The means to
enhance the cross-domain resilience capability of
IoT, where a huge aggregation of objects and
vulnerabilities exist, in a dynamic and automated
way are strongly required.

The study of the similarity between two con-
cepts based on their information presents par-
ticular  research  interest.  The  effort  in  [9]
presents an estimation of semantic proximity
between  arbitrary  concepts  and  concept
instances, using the taxonomic knowledge con-
cepts. The authors in [10] develop a collabora-
tive and proximity-based mechanism for the
clustering of semantic web documents according
to their characteristics. Semantic models and a
web service for querying are used in [11] to sup-
port efficient service discovery, while service
selection using proximity-based ontology filter-
ing  is  proposed.  The  proximity  should  be
expanded  in  IoT  in  order  to  enhance  the

The cornerstone of
the framework is the
concept of the virtu-
al object. VOs are
virtual representa-
tions of any real-

world object, which

ly “always on.”

description, discovery, and selection of objects
based on application requirements, moving from
proximity among objects to proximity between
users/applications and objects.

The research on cognitive management is
mainly focused on resource usage and architec-
tural efficiency in future networks. The effort
in [12] introduces cognitive and self-x princi-
ples in order to optimize the use of the radio
resources and spectrum in future networks.
The OneFit project (www.ict-onefit.eu/) com-
prises cognitive systems and opportunistic net-
works to achieve higher utilization of resources,
lower energy consumption, and reductions in
the total cost of ownership in the future Inter-
net. The UniverSelf project (www.univerself-
project.eu/) designs a unified management
framework for overcoming the management
complexity of future networking systems by
means of federation and self-management. The
introduction of cognitive management in IoT
will enable self-management and self-configu-
ration for the virtual representations of objects
and their (re)use in the context of dynamic ser-
vice provisioning.

Summarizing, the above references reveal
some issues related to how the current trends
address the heterogeneity of objects and the
need for resilience, while identifying that prox-
imity and cognitive management should expand
toward IoT to help smart city development.
These aspects are the motivation for our cogni-
tive framework, introduced in the next section.

FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

CONCEPTS

This effort proposes a cognitive management
framework for IoT that addresses the main
issues identified above:
(cid:129) The considerable number of objects that fall
within the scope of any IoT applications
and their heterogeneity

(cid:129) The inherently unreliable nature of such
objects and the guarantee of the end-to-end
resilience

(cid:129) The complexity associated with the huge
quantities of usable objects in a smart city
context

To this end we have identified the need to sup-
port end users and application providers with
techniques that can automatically select by rele-
vance all potential objects discovered to be avail-
able for use and able to meet given application
requirements. The cornerstone of the framework
is the concept of the virtual object (VO). A VO
is a virtual representation of any real-world
object (RWO), which thus becomes virtually
“always on.” VOs can be dynamically created
and destroyed, and they are dynamic objects
since  they  represent  dynamically  changing
RWOs.

In order to further enhance the resilience
capability, as well as offer an automated ability
to aggregate VOs to meet application require-
ments, the framework introduces the composite
VO  (CVO)  concept.  A  CVO  is  a  cognitive
mashup of semantically interoperable VOs (and
their offered services) that renders services in
accordance with the application requirements.

CVOs enable the reuse of existing VOs outside
their initial context and domain. Besides this
role of fostering aggregation of VOs into more
complex services, once created, CVOs are meant
to maintain their performance and self-reconfig-
ure as the context changes, giving our framework
better levels of resilience/reliability.

As said before, CVOs allow finding the opti-
mal possible way to deliver the application, given
both the capabilities offered by VOs and the
application requirements. The piece of the jig-
saw that completes our framework is the one
that provides the functionality of deriving the so-
called service logic, which represents the transla-
tion of the stakeholder/application requirements
into services to be fulfilled by the CVO level.
This addresses the need to reduce complexity
levels  for  the  users  of  the  platform.  Each
requested service is accompanied with specific
quality of service (QoS) requirements to further
address resilience. 

This level completes the description of how
we equipped our framework to fulfil the three
issues identified earlier. The three distinct con-
ceptual levels of our framework, — VO level,
CVO level, and service level — are illustrated in
Fig. 1.

COGNITION AND PROXIMITY

The main difference of the proposed framework
with respect to existing or past efforts is that cog-
nitive technologies are enabled with the intention
of supporting how we address the key issues high-
lighted above. Cognition is transversal to all three
levels. At the VO level, cognition is used for the
self-management and self-configuration of VOs in
order to maintain a constant link to the relevant
RWOs and manage the relevant data flows. More
precisely, envisioned cognition includes optimiza-
tion techniques to select more appropriate links
with RWOs, as well as learning techniques to pre-
dict problematic links, propose alternate links,
and generate knowledge from data.

At the CVO level, cognition is used in order
to decide on the VOs and CVOs that should be
(re)used to meet the application requirements.
CVOs are self-managed self-configurable objects
that are created dynamically in an autonomous
manner. First, techniques to acquire situation
information (e.g., monitoring relevant VOs and
their associated RWOs) are crucial, so as to dis-
cover VOs/CVOs and exploit their capabilities.
Moreover, learning techniques for predicting
future situations are also helpful in this direc-

Figure 2. Technical view of the proposed framework.

Another vital con-
cept of the frame-
work is the notion of
proximity. Proximity
denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of
relatedness between
any IoT application
and the relevant

objects that may be
used to deliver this.
The actual problem
is about assessing
how close (hence

useful) objects are to
users/applications.

tion. Pattern recognition techniques are then
used to identify if an already existing CVO can
be (re)used for the current application. Other-
wise, optimization techniques are exploited
afresh for the optimal CVO (re)configuration
and selection of CVOs and VOs taking into
account user preferences and the current situa-
tion. The optimization process is aided by learn-
ing techniques for both the prioritization of
candidate CVOs or VOs and the exploitation of
the knowledge they built in past similar situa-
tions. An example of such knowledge derivation
is the learning related to the efficiency of CVO
(re)configuration.

Cognition at the service level is a prerequisite
in order to capture the application requirements
and then guide the selection process at the CVO
level. Semantic reasoning is used for the auto-
matic translation of a user request to a well
formed request for a service, understandable by
the system. Learning techniques build knowledge
of user preferences and eventually act on behalf
of the user. Finally, derivation and management
of information related to policies, that is, con-
straints imposed on the CVO by the administra-
tive domain in which the user is currently located
(set of permissible VOs, priorities for the use of
certain VOs, security related aspects), are strong-
ly required.

Building cognition should not spoil but needs
to coexist with security and privacy features. In the
proposed framework, security and privacy are
mainly considered through authentication and
access control. Authentication provides the means
to validate the identity of the user before s/he
interacts with the system. Access control is used to
regulate access to data and services (through
access 
corresponding  VOs/
CVOs). In this respect, VOs/CVOs are created
and managed with their associated policies and
access rights, which define when, how, and to what
extent the enclosed data/function can be disclosed.
The VOs/CVOs can be accessible only by authen-
ticated parties, which are authorized and granted

to 

the 

with the appropriate level of access according to
their role, even if the VOs/CVOs are distributed
across untrusted networks and domains.

Another vital concept of the framework is the
notion of proximity. Proximity denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of relatedness between any
IoT application and the relevant objects that may
be used to deliver this. The actual problem is
about assessing how close (hence useful) objects
are to users/applications. While the current trend
is to assess how close objects descriptions or data
stored in different databases can be, the differen-
tiation of the framework is toward an effort to
bring  a  much  more  “application-oriented”
approach. Thus, the distance the system wishes
to assess is not necessarily only between objects,
but between users/applications and objects.
Undoubtedly, the proximity is a prerequisite for
achieving more automatic and scalable solutions
in the cognitive selection of VOs/CVOs. 

Figure 2 depicts a technical view of the pro-
posed framework. RWOs are represented by
several colors and shapes, highlighting their het-
erogeneity. One level above, VO/CVO levels are
depicted  as  uniformly  colored  and  shaped
objects. Finally, at the top level, several objects
are selected to be used by a specific application
through the corresponding VOs/CVOs based on
proximity. For illustration purposes, the applica-
tion is considered to aggregate the objects by a
criterion related to either their shape or their
color. The cognition at the VO level as described
above is related to the Cognitive.prep property
allowing prepping the data with which to initially
enrich the VO. The automatic selection of the
most appropriate objects among the available
ones for the purpose of an application is repre-
sented by the Cognitive.select property. This
cognition could be split between the CVO level
and the service level. Proximity is used by the
Cognitive.select process.

As illustrated by the figure, the concepts of
VOs/CVOs are primarily targeted to the abstrac-
tion of heterogeneity. This is first achieved by a

uniform way of representation through seman-
tics. Semantics are used for the specification and
high-level description, registration, discovery,
and access/invocation of existing VOs and CVOs.
As stated before, VOs/CVOs are dynamic, self-
aware, self-managed, and self-configurable
objects that adapt their own operation, even
their own configuration, based on the continu-
ously changing situation related to the underly-
ing  objects  and  overlying  application
requirements. In such a way, they guarantee the
resilience of the application in terms of availabil-
ity, performance, and dependability, and there-
fore of the constituent services. Moreover, CVOs
abstract the domain dependence by allowing the
reuse of VOs outside their initial domain and
offer end-to-end resilience.

FRAMEWORK INSTANTIATION

The previous section illustrated a set of prob-
lems we found to be relevant to future smart
cities and presented an IoT-based cognitive con-

ceptual framework designed to address them. In
this section, we illustrate how such a framework
has been instantiated (Fig. 3). For this purpose,
a representative set of cognitive functions and
components were selected to be implemented as
building blocks in the various framework levels,
and their role is illustrated hereafter.

SERVICE-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The users use appropriate interfaces (which are
left outside the scope of this specific work) after
being authenticated/authorized in order to pro-
vide their application requirements and policies,
which are then conveyed to Application Transla-
tion. This mechanism represents the semantic
reasoning for the automatic translation of a user
request into a language the system understands.
The application requirements are mapped to
request parameters (e.g., requested functions),
taking into account both the user-provided and
local policies.

Then Situation Acquisition is responsible for
deriving the situation associated with the request.

106

IEEE Communications Magazine (cid:129) June 2013

VLACHEAS LAYOUT_Layout 1  5/30/13  4:52 PM  Page 107

The situation is acquired in terms of situation
parameters, which enable the system to be
aware, as well as to foresee potential changes.
The situation parameters may include informa-
tion such as the time of day, the location of
interest, and the available VOs at that time and
place. The situation parameters are combined
with the request parameters, which helps maxi-
mize the reliability of the framework due to
more sophisticated and aware decisions at the
lower levels of the framework.

CVO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

Once the request and situation parameters are
retrieved, the framework needs to check how it
can address those requirements. Request and
Situation Matching (RSM) first performs a
search in order to discover potentially available,
relevant CVOs that can be reused. For this pur-
pose, RSM compares the request and situation
parameters with the corresponding recorded
parameters in the CVO registry (a registry where
logged CVOs are stored) using a satisfaction-
rate-based similarity metric (proximity), reflect-
ing the Euclidean distance between them. If
there is a matching of a satisfactory percentage,
RSM triggers the re-instantiation of existing
CVOs in order to be executed. If not matching
found, then the CVO should be created from
scratch.

In this case, RSM forwards the parameters to
Decision Making (DM) with a proposal of avail-
able VOs derived based on proximity that might
fit the parameters. First, DM interacts with the
VO registry (a registry where logged VOs are
stored with their semantic annotations, which
are used here for an automatic selection pro-
cess) in order to get information about these
VOs (discovery). Then DM selects the appropri-
ate VOs that should be composed for the cre-
ation of the CVO (optimization techniques
discussed earlier). DM registers the new CVO in
the CVO registry and then activates it.

The CVO Registry contains information for
each deployed CVO, which is preserved for a
specific time period. This information includes:
(cid:129) CVO identifier
(cid:129) Request parameters that led to the creation

of the CVO

(cid:129) Situation parameters that represent the con-

text in which the CVO was created

(cid:129) Access rights of the CVO
(cid:129) The VOs that comprise the CVO
The CVO registry is implemented and accessible
similar to the VO registry, as explained later.

Access Control can impose that only the
(C)VOs that can be accessed by a user/applica-
tion appear after a lookup in the (C)VO reg-
istry.

VO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The VO is the virtual representation of an ICT
object (supporting ICT capabilities such as a
smartphone or sensor) that may be associated
with one or more non-ICT objects (e.g., persons,

VOs are implemented as web resources using
RESTful Web Services, shortlisted for the wide
applicability domain. The VO communicates
with the ICT object, either directly or by means
of a gateway, using the REST interface over var-
ious wireless or wired access technologies. The
communication between the ICT object and the
gateway in the second case (or even inside a net-
work of ICT objects connected to a VO through
a gateway) can be realized by different types of
communication technology standards, such as
universal plug and play (UPnP), open metering
system (OMS), data over cable service interface
specifications  (DOCSIS),  and  machine-to-
machine (M2M) communication.

include VO identifier, associations with ICT and
non-ICT objects, location, offered functions, and
access  rights  of  the  VO.  The  semantically
enriched  data  of  the  VOs  are  written  in
Resource Description Framework (RDF) [13],
which was designed as a model for representing
metadata about web resources, and stored in the
RDF graph databases, which implement the VO
registries. VO and CVO registries may be dis-
tributed across several domains.

CASE STUDY AND VALIDATION

This section intends to demonstrate the use of
the proposed IoT cognitive framework and the
cross-application nature of objects in one smart
city scenario that horizontally connects several
application domains and, more specifically,
smart health/smart home/smart living, smart
transport, and public safety. Smart cities are
actually a real driver for connecting application
domains.

STORYLINE SUMMARY

This scenario refers to how the proposed frame-
work may be exploited to protect and facilitate
the daily life in the smart city. Sarah, an elderly
woman, has opted for an assisted living service
that is provided by a medical center. A doctor,
who monitors Sarah’s health remotely from the
medical center, receives an alarm that Sarah has
fainted. An ambulance is instructed to go to
assist Sarah. A smart driving application is used
by the ambulance to reach Sarah’s home as
quickly as possible.

PROOF OF CONCEPT DESCRIPTION

The storyline introduces three different smart
city application domains (smart health, public
safety, smart transport). The situation in each
domain requires a respective CVO:

toring Sarah’s health and the environmental
conditions in the smart home

Figure 4. Use case workﬂow.

The use case workflow is depicted in Fig. 4
and is consistent with the description mentioned
previously. The requested parameters (e.g.,
Sarah’s pulse, room temperature, alarms [in the
medical center and in the smart home] etc.) and
the situation parameters (Sarah’s location, time,
available VOs representing a body pulse sensor, a
temperature sensor, a fire alarm, etc.) are extract-
ed by Application Translation and Situation
Acquisition to be used for deriving the CVO in
the medical center. The scenario assumes that an
appropriate existing CVO cannot be found by
RSM, so DM selects the appropriate VOs and
triggers the creation of a new CVO. The fire
alarm is selected to play the role of the alarm in
the smart home based on proximity. This selec-
tion of an object to deliver an application require-
ment (“raise an alarm”) in an approximate way
(“make noise”) enhances the resilience of the ser-
vice offered by the CVO in the absence of more
appropriate objects. The CVO is then executed.

When Sarah faints, the CVO becomes aware
of the accident, since it receives periodic mea-
surements from the body pulse VO and com-
pares them with a predefined threshold. An
alarm is raised by the CVO in both the smart
home (fire alarm) and the medical center, the
latter being automatically transmitted to an
ambulance, potentially with some policies about
the seriousness of the incident. The ambulance

requests a CVO for smart driving in order to
find the best route to Sarah’s home and save
valuable time. RSM finds and instantiates an
existing CVO that matches the request. This
CVO receives input data from the Traffic Moni-
toring CVO in the police department, which
combines real-time data from different types of
sensors (e.g., cameras, gas sensors, magnetic
field sensors [MFSs]) and infers the traffic status
in the city’s streets. For instance, if the MFSs
detect many cars and the carbon dioxide levels
are higher than a value, it can infer that there is
a traffic jam in the specific area.

The implementation aspects are depicted in
Fig. 5. The emulated smart city includes the
smart home of Sarah, which is equipped with
actuators and sensors hosted by wireless sensor
network (WSN) platforms A and B, respectively.
The CVO in the medical center uses the Cosm
online database service in order to get the sen-
sor measurements from WSN platform B as well
as to send the actuator commands to WSN plat-
form A. In the smart city, there are various types
of sensors, which are connected through WSN
platform C using various access technologies
and/or communication protocols (ZigBee, Blue-
tooth, Wi-Fi, etc.) sharing their data. The CVO
in the police department receives data from the
distributed platforms of type C in order to infer
the traffic status in the city’s streets.

Figure 5. Implementation aspects of the smart city scenario.

For the performance evaluation of the frame-
work, we have conducted an indicative experi-
ment. The application requests a service that
consists of four functions (which represent the
request parameters). The service execution time
for different numbers of available objects that
are located in the area of interest is presented in
Fig. 6 for three cases. The first one corresponds
to the lack of the framework with respect to cog-
nition/proximity at the CVO level using an
exhaustive search technique for selecting the
appropriate objects (case A), the second one to
CVO creation through the DM process using the
CPLEX algorithm [14] (case B), and the last one
to the CVO instantiation (reuse of an existing
CVO) through the RSM process based on rank-
ing CVO records according to a satisfaction rate
similarity metric (case C). As depicted, the ser-
vice execution time is decreased through DM,
while further time savings are achieved through
RSM, showing that cognition/proximity can
decrease operational expenditures (OPEX).

The benefits of the framework can be sum-

marized as follows:
(cid:129) Easy creation and delivery of value-added
services from business actors allowing them
to increase profits and market share

(cid:129) Service provision dynamically tailored to the
needs of end users, even being able to act
on behalf of them

(cid:129) Decrease capital expenditures for telecom
and  service  providers  due  to  gradual
replacement of legacy technology enabled
by VO abstraction without disrupting cur-
rently delivered services

(cid:129) Development of innovative cross-domain

applications due to CVO abstraction

(cid:129) Support of large-scale networking through

cognition

(cid:129) Reduced OPEX in terms of time, mainte-
nance, and energy consumption via cogni-
tion/proximity

(cid:129) Decrease in time to market by reusing avail-

able VOs

(cid:129) New  business  roles  as  (C)VOs  may  be

owned by different stakeholders

CONCLUSIONS

This article presents a cognitive management
framework that will empower the Internet of
Things to better support sustainable smart city
development. Our study revealed the need to
address the heterogeneity of objects, while guar-

anteeing the resilience of associated services and
their dynamic provisioning. Proximity and cogni-
tion were identified as promising solutions that
enable applications to use the most relevant con-
nected objects in an intelligent and autonomic
way. The framework introduced the virtual
object concept as a dynamic virtual representa-
tion of objects and proposed the composite VO
concept as a means to automatically aggregate
VOs in order to meet users’ requirements in a
resilient way. In addition, it illustrates the envis-
aged role of service-level functionality needed to
achieve the necessary compliance between appli-
cations and VOs/CVOs, while hiding complexity
from end users. The envisioned cognition at
each level and the use of proximity are described
in detail, while some of these aspects are instan-
tiated by means of building blocks. A case study,
which presents how the framework could be use-
ful in a smart city scenario that horizontally
spans  several  application  domains,  is  also
described. Future plans include the implementa-
tion of the remaining concepts and a more
detailed proof of concept in terms of qualita-
tive/quantitative results.

ABSTRACT

The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to
substantially support sustainable development of
future smart cities. This article identifies the
main issues that may prevent IoT from playing
this crucial role, such as the heterogeneity among
connected objects and the unreliable nature of
associated services. To solve these issues, a cog-
nitive management framework for IoT is pro-
posed, in which dynamically changing real-world
objects are represented in a virtualized environ-
ment, and where cognition and proximity are
used to select the most relevant objects for the
purpose of an application in an intelligent and
autonomic way. Part of the framework is instan-
tiated in terms of building blocks and demon-
strated  through  a  smart  city  scenario  that
horizontally spans several application domains.
This preliminary proof of concept reveals the
high potential that self-reconfigurable IoT can
achieve in the context of smart cities.

INTRODUCTION

Urban living already poses major challenges in
our daily lives. The United Nations Population
Fund forecasts that by 2030 approximately 60
percent of the world population will live in an
urban environment, while 27 megacities with
greater than 10 million people are anticipated to
exist [1]. Therefore, urgent solutions are sought
for viable living conditions and sustainable city
development. On the other hand, the tremen-
dous development of information and communi-
cations technologies (ICT) and the power of the
Internet may help us see the light at the end of
the tunnel.

Even at present, we can hardly imagine our
life without the Internet. With more and more
connected objects becoming available, it will be

being used across application domains

(cid:129) Availability of a wide set of predefined ser-

even harder to imagine that the Internet we use
today to reach people, find information, and
assist us in our daily lives with innovative ser-
vices will not be extended toward creating value
out of such increased availability of connected
objects. This article is about helping to achieve
that transition from the Internet of People to
the Internet of Things (IoT) for People, especial-
ly in the context of future smart cities.

According to the European Research Cluster
on the Internet of Things, IoT is a dynamic glob-
al self-configuring network infrastructure where
physical and virtual “things” are identifiable and
communicate with standard and interoperable
protocols. While it is anticipated that IoT will be
the great hope of sustainable city life [2], the evi-
dence on how this will be achieved is not so
straightforward because of:
(cid:129) Technological barriers among objects when

vices and applications
Within this contextual background we pro-
pose a cognitive management framework that
aims at showing, besides the widely addressed
issue of how objects should be connected, why
and when objects need to be connected, and
what value they can bring in enhancing existing
services and applications.

To this effect, the proposed framework focus-
es mainly on four axes: how we plan to hide het-
erogeneity of connected objects, how we ensure
resilience (ability to deliver service that can be
justifiably trusted in spite of continuous changes)
of dynamic service provisioning, how we instruct
systems to assess proximity (metric of relevance)
between IoT applications and “useful” objects,
and how the use of cognitive technologies [3]
(ability to dynamically select behavior through
self-management, taking into account informa-
tion and knowledge on the context of operation

as well as policies) offers intelligence while mini-
mizing users’ intervention. Moreover, some
experimental evidence to support the theory
behind our proposed framework is provided. 

RELATED WORK

The previous section has identified the hetero-
geneity of objects and the need for resilience as
main challenges to be addressed by IoT in the
effort for a sustainable smart city, while it has
also introduced proximity and cognition as
promising factors toward this direction.

In the scope of IoT, the virtualization of
objects and the use of semantics are the most
important assets for addressing the heterogene-
ity of objects. The authors in [4] use virtual sen-
sor abstraction in order to hide the complexity in
large-scale interconnected sensor networks. The
CONVERGENCE project (www.ict-conver-
gence.eu/) introduces a common container for
any kind of digital data, including representa-
tions of services, people, and real-world objects.
The EBBITS project (www.ebbits-project.eu/
news.php) aims at transforming every device into
a web service with semantic resolution. The
CASAGRAS project (www.iot-casagras.org/)
suggests the object’s identification in the physical
layer through the use of ontology instead of rep-
resentations.  However,  there  is  a  need  for
dynamic and intelligent virtual representation of
objects, which will allow them to become virtual-
ly “always on” in accordance with application
requirements and despite changing conditions.

Several efforts have been performed in the
field of resilience. In [5], the authors present a
taxonomy for threats and countermeasures with
respect  to  dependability  and  security.  The
ENISA study in [6] intends to provide end-to-
end consideration of resilience through an ontol-
ogy that encompasses different domains and
helps hide the heterogeneity of the underlying
infrastructure. In [7], a security framework is
presented that comprises mechanisms to achieve
intrusion detection and reaction. The work in [8]
focuses on enhancing the resilience of superviso-
ry control and data acquisition (SCADA) sys-
tems  against  cyber  attacks.  However,  the
majority of these efforts concern separate appli-
cation domains and rely on human intervention
in order to resolve problems. The means to
enhance the cross-domain resilience capability of
IoT, where a huge aggregation of objects and
vulnerabilities exist, in a dynamic and automated
way are strongly required.

The study of the similarity between two con-
cepts based on their information presents par-
ticular  research  interest.  The  effort  in  [9]
presents an estimation of semantic proximity
between  arbitrary  concepts  and  concept
instances, using the taxonomic knowledge con-
cepts. The authors in [10] develop a collabora-
tive and proximity-based mechanism for the
clustering of semantic web documents according
to their characteristics. Semantic models and a
web service for querying are used in [11] to sup-
port efficient service discovery, while service
selection using proximity-based ontology filter-
ing  is  proposed.  The  proximity  should  be
expanded  in  IoT  in  order  to  enhance  the

the framework is the
concept of the virtu-
al object. VOs are
virtual representa-
tions of any real-

world object, which

description, discovery, and selection of objects
based on application requirements, moving from
proximity among objects to proximity between
users/applications and objects.

The research on cognitive management is
mainly focused on resource usage and architec-
tural efficiency in future networks. The effort
in [12] introduces cognitive and self-x princi-
ples in order to optimize the use of the radio
resources and spectrum in future networks.
The OneFit project (www.ict-onefit.eu/) com-
prises cognitive systems and opportunistic net-
works to achieve higher utilization of resources,
lower energy consumption, and reductions in
the total cost of ownership in the future Inter-
net. The UniverSelf project (www.univerself-
project.eu/) designs a unified management
framework for overcoming the management
complexity of future networking systems by
means of federation and self-management. The
introduction of cognitive management in IoT
will enable self-management and self-configu-
ration for the virtual representations of objects
and their (re)use in the context of dynamic ser-
vice provisioning.

Summarizing, the above references reveal
some issues related to how the current trends
address the heterogeneity of objects and the
need for resilience, while identifying that prox-
imity and cognitive management should expand
toward IoT to help smart city development.
These aspects are the motivation for our cogni-
tive framework, introduced in the next section.

FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

CONCEPTS

This effort proposes a cognitive management
framework for IoT that addresses the main
issues identified above:
(cid:129) The considerable number of objects that fall
within the scope of any IoT applications
and their heterogeneity

(cid:129) The inherently unreliable nature of such
objects and the guarantee of the end-to-end
resilience

(cid:129) The complexity associated with the huge
quantities of usable objects in a smart city
context

To this end we have identified the need to sup-
port end users and application providers with
techniques that can automatically select by rele-
vance all potential objects discovered to be avail-
able for use and able to meet given application
requirements. The cornerstone of the framework
is the concept of the virtual object (VO). A VO
is a virtual representation of any real-world
object (RWO), which thus becomes virtually
“always on.” VOs can be dynamically created
and destroyed, and they are dynamic objects
since  they  represent  dynamically  changing
RWOs.

In order to further enhance the resilience
capability, as well as offer an automated ability
to aggregate VOs to meet application require-
ments, the framework introduces the composite
VO  (CVO)  concept.  A  CVO  is  a  cognitive
mashup of semantically interoperable VOs (and
their offered services) that renders services in
accordance with the application requirements.

CVOs enable the reuse of existing VOs outside
their initial context and domain. Besides this
role of fostering aggregation of VOs into more
complex services, once created, CVOs are meant
to maintain their performance and self-reconfig-
ure as the context changes, giving our framework
better levels of resilience/reliability.

As said before, CVOs allow finding the opti-
mal possible way to deliver the application, given
both the capabilities offered by VOs and the
application requirements. The piece of the jig-
saw that completes our framework is the one
that provides the functionality of deriving the so-
called service logic, which represents the transla-
tion of the stakeholder/application requirements
into services to be fulfilled by the CVO level.
This addresses the need to reduce complexity
levels  for  the  users  of  the  platform.  Each
requested service is accompanied with specific
quality of service (QoS) requirements to further
address resilience. 

This level completes the description of how
we equipped our framework to fulfil the three
issues identified earlier. The three distinct con-
ceptual levels of our framework, — VO level,
CVO level, and service level — are illustrated in
Fig. 1.

COGNITION AND PROXIMITY

The main difference of the proposed framework
with respect to existing or past efforts is that cog-
nitive technologies are enabled with the intention
of supporting how we address the key issues high-
lighted above. Cognition is transversal to all three
levels. At the VO level, cognition is used for the
self-management and self-configuration of VOs in
order to maintain a constant link to the relevant
RWOs and manage the relevant data flows. More
precisely, envisioned cognition includes optimiza-
tion techniques to select more appropriate links
with RWOs, as well as learning techniques to pre-
dict problematic links, propose alternate links,
and generate knowledge from data.

At the CVO level, cognition is used in order
to decide on the VOs and CVOs that should be
(re)used to meet the application requirements.
CVOs are self-managed self-configurable objects
that are created dynamically in an autonomous
manner. First, techniques to acquire situation
information (e.g., monitoring relevant VOs and
their associated RWOs) are crucial, so as to dis-
cover VOs/CVOs and exploit their capabilities.
Moreover, learning techniques for predicting
future situations are also helpful in this direc-

Figure 2. Technical view of the proposed framework.

Another vital con-
cept of the frame-
work is the notion of
proximity. Proximity
denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of
relatedness between
any IoT application
and the relevant

objects that may be
used to deliver this.
The actual problem
is about assessing
how close (hence

useful) objects are to
users/applications.

tion. Pattern recognition techniques are then
used to identify if an already existing CVO can
be (re)used for the current application. Other-
wise, optimization techniques are exploited
afresh for the optimal CVO (re)configuration
and selection of CVOs and VOs taking into
account user preferences and the current situa-
tion. The optimization process is aided by learn-
ing techniques for both the prioritization of
candidate CVOs or VOs and the exploitation of
the knowledge they built in past similar situa-
tions. An example of such knowledge derivation
is the learning related to the efficiency of CVO
(re)configuration.

Cognition at the service level is a prerequisite
in order to capture the application requirements
and then guide the selection process at the CVO
level. Semantic reasoning is used for the auto-
matic translation of a user request to a well
formed request for a service, understandable by
the system. Learning techniques build knowledge
of user preferences and eventually act on behalf
of the user. Finally, derivation and management
of information related to policies, that is, con-
straints imposed on the CVO by the administra-
tive domain in which the user is currently located
(set of permissible VOs, priorities for the use of
certain VOs, security related aspects), are strong-
ly required.

Building cognition should not spoil but needs
to coexist with security and privacy features. In the
proposed framework, security and privacy are
mainly considered through authentication and
access control. Authentication provides the means
to validate the identity of the user before s/he
interacts with the system. Access control is used to
regulate access to data and services (through
access 
corresponding  VOs/
CVOs). In this respect, VOs/CVOs are created
and managed with their associated policies and
access rights, which define when, how, and to what
extent the enclosed data/function can be disclosed.
The VOs/CVOs can be accessible only by authen-
ticated parties, which are authorized and granted

to 

the 

with the appropriate level of access according to
their role, even if the VOs/CVOs are distributed
across untrusted networks and domains.

Another vital concept of the framework is the
notion of proximity. Proximity denotes the estab-
lishment of a level of relatedness between any
IoT application and the relevant objects that may
be used to deliver this. The actual problem is
about assessing how close (hence useful) objects
are to users/applications. While the current trend
is to assess how close objects descriptions or data
stored in different databases can be, the differen-
tiation of the framework is toward an effort to
bring  a  much  more  “application-oriented”
approach. Thus, the distance the system wishes
to assess is not necessarily only between objects,
but between users/applications and objects.
Undoubtedly, the proximity is a prerequisite for
achieving more automatic and scalable solutions
in the cognitive selection of VOs/CVOs. 

Figure 2 depicts a technical view of the pro-
posed framework. RWOs are represented by
several colors and shapes, highlighting their het-
erogeneity. One level above, VO/CVO levels are
depicted  as  uniformly  colored  and  shaped
objects. Finally, at the top level, several objects
are selected to be used by a specific application
through the corresponding VOs/CVOs based on
proximity. For illustration purposes, the applica-
tion is considered to aggregate the objects by a
criterion related to either their shape or their
color. The cognition at the VO level as described
above is related to the Cognitive.prep property
allowing prepping the data with which to initially
enrich the VO. The automatic selection of the
most appropriate objects among the available
ones for the purpose of an application is repre-
sented by the Cognitive.select property. This
cognition could be split between the CVO level
and the service level. Proximity is used by the
Cognitive.select process.

As illustrated by the figure, the concepts of
VOs/CVOs are primarily targeted to the abstrac-
tion of heterogeneity. This is first achieved by a

uniform way of representation through seman-
tics. Semantics are used for the specification and
high-level description, registration, discovery,
and access/invocation of existing VOs and CVOs.
As stated before, VOs/CVOs are dynamic, self-
aware, self-managed, and self-configurable
objects that adapt their own operation, even
their own configuration, based on the continu-
ously changing situation related to the underly-
ing  objects  and  overlying  application
requirements. In such a way, they guarantee the
resilience of the application in terms of availabil-
ity, performance, and dependability, and there-
fore of the constituent services. Moreover, CVOs
abstract the domain dependence by allowing the
reuse of VOs outside their initial domain and
offer end-to-end resilience.

FRAMEWORK INSTANTIATION

The previous section illustrated a set of prob-
lems we found to be relevant to future smart
cities and presented an IoT-based cognitive con-

ceptual framework designed to address them. In
this section, we illustrate how such a framework
has been instantiated (Fig. 3). For this purpose,
a representative set of cognitive functions and
components were selected to be implemented as
building blocks in the various framework levels,
and their role is illustrated hereafter.

SERVICE-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The users use appropriate interfaces (which are
left outside the scope of this specific work) after
being authenticated/authorized in order to pro-
vide their application requirements and policies,
which are then conveyed to Application Transla-
tion. This mechanism represents the semantic
reasoning for the automatic translation of a user
request into a language the system understands.
The application requirements are mapped to
request parameters (e.g., requested functions),
taking into account both the user-provided and
local policies.

Then Situation Acquisition is responsible for
deriving the situation associated with the request.

106

IEEE Communications Magazine (cid:129) June 2013

VLACHEAS LAYOUT_Layout 1  5/30/13  4:52 PM  Page 107

The situation is acquired in terms of situation
parameters, which enable the system to be
aware, as well as to foresee potential changes.
The situation parameters may include informa-
tion such as the time of day, the location of
interest, and the available VOs at that time and
place. The situation parameters are combined
with the request parameters, which helps maxi-
mize the reliability of the framework due to
more sophisticated and aware decisions at the
lower levels of the framework.

CVO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

Once the request and situation parameters are
retrieved, the framework needs to check how it
can address those requirements. Request and
Situation Matching (RSM) first performs a
search in order to discover potentially available,
relevant CVOs that can be reused. For this pur-
pose, RSM compares the request and situation
parameters with the corresponding recorded
parameters in the CVO registry (a registry where
logged CVOs are stored) using a satisfaction-
rate-based similarity metric (proximity), reflect-
ing the Euclidean distance between them. If
there is a matching of a satisfactory percentage,
RSM triggers the re-instantiation of existing
CVOs in order to be executed. If not matching
found, then the CVO should be created from
scratch.

In this case, RSM forwards the parameters to
Decision Making (DM) with a proposal of avail-
able VOs derived based on proximity that might
fit the parameters. First, DM interacts with the
VO registry (a registry where logged VOs are
stored with their semantic annotations, which
are used here for an automatic selection pro-
cess) in order to get information about these
VOs (discovery). Then DM selects the appropri-
ate VOs that should be composed for the cre-
ation of the CVO (optimization techniques
discussed earlier). DM registers the new CVO in
the CVO registry and then activates it.

The CVO Registry contains information for
each deployed CVO, which is preserved for a
specific time period. This information includes:
(cid:129) CVO identifier
(cid:129) Request parameters that led to the creation

of the CVO

(cid:129) Situation parameters that represent the con-

text in which the CVO was created

(cid:129) Access rights of the CVO
(cid:129) The VOs that comprise the CVO
The CVO registry is implemented and accessible
similar to the VO registry, as explained later.

Access Control can impose that only the
(C)VOs that can be accessed by a user/applica-
tion appear after a lookup in the (C)VO reg-
istry.

VO-LEVEL COMPONENTS

The VO is the virtual representation of an ICT
object (supporting ICT capabilities such as a
smartphone or sensor) that may be associated
with one or more non-ICT objects (e.g., persons,
places). Both ICT and non-ICT objects are
RWOs. The information regarding the VO is
semantically enriched by adding contextual
information (metadata) through learning tech-
niques and the use of ontology that helps assess

Apart from running
instances of VOs, the
VO level comprises
the VO registries,
which store the

data that are used
for the description of
the VOs, in order to

the authorized 

parties.

proximity in the selection of relevant objects.
VOs are implemented as web resources using
RESTful Web Services, shortlisted for the wide
applicability domain. The VO communicates
with the ICT object, either directly or by means
of a gateway, using the REST interface over var-
ious wireless or wired access technologies. The
communication between the ICT object and the
gateway in the second case (or even inside a net-
work of ICT objects connected to a VO through
a gateway) can be realized by different types of
communication technology standards, such as
universal plug and play (UPnP), open metering
system (OMS), data over cable service interface
specifications  (DOCSIS),  and  machine-to-
machine (M2M) communication.

Apart from running instances of VOs, the
VO level comprises the VO registries, which
store the semantically enriched data that are
used for the description of the VOs, in order to
be available any time from anywhere for the
authorized parties. The stored information may
include VO identifier, associations with ICT and
non-ICT objects, location, offered functions, and
access  rights  of  the  VO.  The  semantically
enriched  data  of  the  VOs  are  written  in
Resource Description Framework (RDF) [13],
which was designed as a model for representing
metadata about web resources, and stored in the
RDF graph databases, which implement the VO
registries. VO and CVO registries may be dis-
tributed across several domains.

CASE STUDY AND VALIDATION

This section intends to demonstrate the use of
the proposed IoT cognitive framework and the
cross-application nature of objects in one smart
city scenario that horizontally connects several
application domains and, more specifically,
smart health/smart home/smart living, smart
transport, and public safety. Smart cities are
actually a real driver for connecting application
domains.

STORYLINE SUMMARY

This scenario refers to how the proposed frame-
work may be exploited to protect and facilitate
the daily life in the smart city. Sarah, an elderly
woman, has opted for an assisted living service
that is provided by a medical center. A doctor,
who monitors Sarah’s health remotely from the
medical center, receives an alarm that Sarah has
fainted. An ambulance is instructed to go to
assist Sarah. A smart driving application is used
by the ambulance to reach Sarah’s home as
quickly as possible.

PROOF OF CONCEPT DESCRIPTION

The storyline introduces three different smart
city application domains (smart health, public
safety, smart transport). The situation in each
domain requires a respective CVO:

toring Sarah’s health and the environmental
conditions in the smart home

Figure 4. Use case workﬂow.

The use case workflow is depicted in Fig. 4
and is consistent with the description mentioned
previously. The requested parameters (e.g.,
Sarah’s pulse, room temperature, alarms [in the
medical center and in the smart home] etc.) and
the situation parameters (Sarah’s location, time,
available VOs representing a body pulse sensor, a
temperature sensor, a fire alarm, etc.) are extract-
ed by Application Translation and Situation
Acquisition to be used for deriving the CVO in
the medical center. The scenario assumes that an
appropriate existing CVO cannot be found by
RSM, so DM selects the appropriate VOs and
triggers the creation of a new CVO. The fire
alarm is selected to play the role of the alarm in
the smart home based on proximity. This selec-
tion of an object to deliver an application require-
ment (“raise an alarm”) in an approximate way
(“make noise”) enhances the resilience of the ser-
vice offered by the CVO in the absence of more
appropriate objects. The CVO is then executed.

When Sarah faints, the CVO becomes aware
of the accident, since it receives periodic mea-
surements from the body pulse VO and com-
pares them with a predefined threshold. An
alarm is raised by the CVO in both the smart
home (fire alarm) and the medical center, the
latter being automatically transmitted to an
ambulance, potentially with some policies about
the seriousness of the incident. The ambulance

requests a CVO for smart driving in order to
find the best route to Sarah’s home and save
valuable time. RSM finds and instantiates an
existing CVO that matches the request. This
CVO receives input data from the Traffic Moni-
toring CVO in the police department, which
combines real-time data from different types of
sensors (e.g., cameras, gas sensors, magnetic
field sensors [MFSs]) and infers the traffic status
in the city’s streets. For instance, if the MFSs
detect many cars and the carbon dioxide levels
are higher than a value, it can infer that there is
a traffic jam in the specific area.

The implementation aspects are depicted in
Fig. 5. The emulated smart city includes the
smart home of Sarah, which is equipped with
actuators and sensors hosted by wireless sensor
network (WSN) platforms A and B, respectively.
The CVO in the medical center uses the Cosm
online database service in order to get the sen-
sor measurements from WSN platform B as well
as to send the actuator commands to WSN plat-
form A. In the smart city, there are various types
of sensors, which are connected through WSN
platform C using various access technologies
and/or communication protocols (ZigBee, Blue-
tooth, Wi-Fi, etc.) sharing their data. The CVO
in the police department receives data from the
distributed platforms of type C in order to infer
the traffic status in the city’s streets.

Figure 5. Implementation aspects of the smart city scenario.

For the performance evaluation of the frame-
work, we have conducted an indicative experi-
ment. The application requests a service that
consists of four functions (which represent the
request parameters). The service execution time
for different numbers of available objects that
are located in the area of interest is presented in
Fig. 6 for three cases. The first one corresponds
to the lack of the framework with respect to cog-
nition/proximity at the CVO level using an
exhaustive search technique for selecting the
appropriate objects (case A), the second one to
CVO creation through the DM process using the
CPLEX algorithm [14] (case B), and the last one
to the CVO instantiation (reuse of an existing
CVO) through the RSM process based on rank-
ing CVO records according to a satisfaction rate
similarity metric (case C). As depicted, the ser-
vice execution time is decreased through DM,
while further time savings are achieved through
RSM, showing that cognition/proximity can
decrease operational expenditures (OPEX).

The benefits of the framework can be sum-

marized as follows:
(cid:129) Easy creation and delivery of value-added
services from business actors allowing them
to increase profits and market share

(cid:129) Service provision dynamically tailored to the
needs of end users, even being able to act
on behalf of them

(cid:129) Decrease capital expenditures for telecom
and  service  providers  due  to  gradual
replacement of legacy technology enabled
by VO abstraction without disrupting cur-
rently delivered services

(cid:129) Development of innovative cross-domain

applications due to CVO abstraction

(cid:129) Support of large-scale networking through

cognition

(cid:129) Reduced OPEX in terms of time, mainte-
nance, and energy consumption via cogni-
tion/proximity

(cid:129) Decrease in time to market by reusing avail-

able VOs

(cid:129) New  business  roles  as  (C)VOs  may  be

owned by different stakeholders

CONCLUSIONS

This article presents a cognitive management
framework that will empower the Internet of
Things to better support sustainable smart city
development. Our study revealed the need to
address the heterogeneity of objects, while guar-

anteeing the resilience of associated services and
their dynamic provisioning. Proximity and cogni-
tion were identified as promising solutions that
enable applications to use the most relevant con-
nected objects in an intelligent and autonomic
way. The framework introduced the virtual
object concept as a dynamic virtual representa-
tion of objects and proposed the composite VO
concept as a means to automatically aggregate
VOs in order to meet users’ requirements in a
resilient way. In addition, it illustrates the envis-
aged role of service-level functionality needed to
achieve the necessary compliance between appli-
cations and VOs/CVOs, while hiding complexity
from end users. The envisioned cognition at
each level and the use of proximity are described
in detail, while some of these aspects are instan-
tiated by means of building blocks. A case study,
which presents how the framework could be use-
ful in a smart city scenario that horizontally
spans  several  application  domains,  is  also
described. Future plans include the implementa-
tion of the remaining concepts and a more
detailed proof of concept in terms of qualita-
tive/quantitative results.
