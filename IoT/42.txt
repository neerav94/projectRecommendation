In  the  Internet  of  Things  vision,  every  physical  object  has  a  virtual 
component  that  can  produce  and  consume  services.  Such  extreme 

interconnection will bring unprecedented convenience and economy, but it 

will also require novel approaches to ensure its safe and ethical use. 

In the Internet of Things (IoT), everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and thing 
has  a  locatable,  addressable,  and  readable  counterpart  on  the  Internet.  These  virtual  entities  can  produce 
and consume services and collaborate toward a common goal.  The user’s phone knows about his physical 
and  mental  state  through  a  network  of  devices  that  surround  his  body,  so  it  can  act  on  his  behalf.  The

characteristics, the IoT promises to extend “anywhere, anyhow, anytime” computing to “anything, anyone, 
any service.” 

Several significant obstacles remain to fulfill the IoT vision, among them security. The Internet and its 
users  are  already  under  continual  attack,  and  a  growing  economy—replete  with  business  models  that

Objects  that  belong  to  a  virtual  world  can  be  made 
aware of objects outside that world—including the services that other objects and entities provide. Sensors 
that  monitor  agricultural  fields  can  access  weather  reports  for  the  area  and  adapt  the  irrigation  systems 
accordingly.  Developers  can  also  decrease  system  dependence  on  a  centralized  architecture,  creating 
autonomous applications.  Mobile phones  without Internet  connection in a disaster area  can collaborate to 
propagate the location of a sensor-enabled water source.  

This staggered approach might help  society enjoy  IoT’s benefits as analysts and researchers tackle the 
complexities in its underlying infrastructure. The problems will be both technical and semantic, requiring 
interoperable mechanisms that can both connect entities and help them understand each other. Distributed 
services must be reliable, not only offering availability but also adapting themselves in case of malfunction. 
A governance model must scale to billions of devices all over the world. Within these meta challenges are 
issues such as bootstrapping, mobility, scalability, data processing, standardization, and billing.  

COPING WITH OLD AND NEW THREATS 

Not surprisingly, even a staggered approach to developing the IoT presents a daunting task for security. 
What protection measures are possible as billions of intelligent things cooperate with other real and virtual 
entities  in  random  and  unpredictable  ways?  The  IoT’s  highly  distributed  nature  and  use  of  fragile 
technologies, such as limited-function embedded devices in public areas, create weak links that  malicious 
entities  can  exploit.  Easily  accessible  objects  in  unprotected  zones,  such  as  city  streets,  are  vulnerable  to 
physical  harm.  Like  compromising  botnets,  some  objects  would  try  to  hinder  services  from  the  inside. 
Additional threats include the existence of a domino effect between intertwined services and user profiling 
through data collection and other methods. 

To avoid these threats, the IoT must have strong security foundations built on a holistic view of security 
for all IoT elements at all  stages—from the identification  of objects to the provisioning of services,  from 
the  acquisition  of  data  to  the  governance  of  the  whole  infrastructure.  All  security  mechanisms  must 
consider each object’s lifecycle and services from the very beginning of that object’s existence.  

Protocol and network security 

Heterogeneity  greatly  affects  the  protection  of  the  network  infrastructure.  Highly  constrained  devices 
that use low-bandwidth standards, such as IEEE 802.15.4, must open a secure communication channel with 
more  powerful  devices—for  example,  sensor  nodes  scattered  in  a  smart  city  communicate  with 
smartphones  or  PDAs.  Securing  this  channel  requires  optimal  cryptography  algorithms  and  adequate  key 
management  systems,  as  well  as  security  protocols  that  connect  all  these  devices  through  the  Internet. 
Although  it  is  not  clear  how  many  resources  will  be  available  to  such  constrained  devices  once  the  IoT 
truly  takes  off,  it  is  safe  to  optimize  security  as  much  as  possible  to  improve  the  provision  of  future 
services. 

In  a  bottom-up  approach,  cryptography  is  the  cornerstone  for  network  infrastructure  protection. 
Although it is possible to implement existing  standards,  such as  AES,  some IoT devices, such as passive 
RFID tags, might be extremely constrained. Cryptographic mechanisms must be smaller and faster but with 
little  or  no  reduction  in  security  level.  Mechanisms  could  include  symmetric  algorithms,  hash  functions, 
and random number generators.  

In this approach, cryptography is the bricks and the  mortar is the  key-management infrastructures that 
establish  keying  material,  for  example,  shared  secret  keys.  Making  this  mortar  requires  associating 
previously  unrelated  and  sometimes  highly  constrained  objects  in  an  extremely  dynamic  environment. 
Manual  configuration  works  only  in  small  and  personal  environments,  and  traditional  public-key 
infrastructures will almost certainly not scale to accommodate the IoT’s amalgam of contexts and devices. 
There is also the issue of rekeying devices to keep information flow safe in the long run. 

Further  up  the  network  infrastructure  are  the  communication  layers.  Clearly,  the  IoT  must  extensively 
use  Internet  standards  for  communication  and  service  provision.  Still,  some  devices,  such  as  sensors  that 
check the state of runway lights, will lack the resources to implement the Internet security mechanisms that 
normally  protect  these  kinds  of  interactions.  Therefore,  security  protocols  require  some  forward-looking 
adaptation. Subtle differences between IoT and Internet protocols might lead to gaps in end-to-end security. 
Adaptations  should  not  only  fulfill  the  IoT’s  performance  requirements  but  also  provide  the  protocol’s

Adaptations  should  not  only  fulfill  the  IoT’s  performance  requirements  but  also  provide  the  protocol’s 

original security properties in the context of the Internet architecture.[2] 

Data and privacy 

Privacy is one of  the  most sensitive  subjects in any discussion of IoT protection. The data availability 
explosion has created Big Brother-like entities that profile and track users without their consent. The IoT’s 
anywhere,  anything,  anytime  nature  could  easily  turn  such  practices  into  a  dystopia.  Users  would  have 
access to an unprecedented number of personalized services, all of which would generate considerable data, 
and the environment itself would be able to acquire information about users automatically.  

Although a dystopia is the worst-case scenario, the IoT could certainly exacerbate a range of undesirable 
situations.  Facebook  accounts  already  affect  a  user’s  employability  and  personal  interactions.  Imagine 
exponentially more such exposure opportunities.   

Privacy by design. One viable solution is privacy by design, in which users would have the tools they 
need to manage their own data. The solution is not too far from current reality. Whenever users produce a 
data fragment, they can already use dynamic consent tools that permit certain services to access as little or 
as  much  of  that  data  as  desired.  Taking  that  idea  a  step  further,  a  user  in  Central  Park  could  provide  a 
location-based service with the information that he’s in New York City, but not that he’s in a specific park. 
Transparency.  Transparency  is  also  essential,  since  users  should  know  which  entities  are  managing 
their data and how and when those entities are using it. Stakeholders such as service providers must be part 
of this equation,  which  might  make  take-it-or-leave-it license agreements  obsolete. Businesses  will adjust 
their services according to the amount of personal data the user provides. 

Data  management.  A  huge  issue  is  deciding  who  manages  the  secrets.  Technically,  cryptographic 
mechanisms and protocols protect data throughout the service’s life cycle, but some entities might lack the 
resources  to  manage  such  mechanisms.  In  other  words,  one  data  management  policy  will  not  fit  all 
situations.  Consequently,  there  must be policies on how to  manage  various  kinds of data as  well as  some 
policy-enforcement  mechanism.  Developing  such  data  management  policies  and  enforcing  them  is  not 
trivial. It requires interpreting, translating, and optimally reconciling a series of rules, each of which might 
be  in  a  different  language.  And  any  policies  must  align  with  legislation  on  data  protection,  which  itself 
could change. 

Identity management 

In  the  IoT,  identity  management  requires  considering  a  staggering  variety  of  identity  and  relationship 

types, according to certain object identity principles:  

  An  object’s  identity  is  not  the  same  as  the  identity  of  its  underlying  mechanisms.  The  x-ray 
machine in the radiology department might have an IP address, but it should also have its own 
identity to distinguish it from other machines.  

  An object can have one core identity and several temporary identities. A hospital can become a 

meeting place for a health conference or a shelter after a fire.  

  An object can identify itself using its identity or its specific features. A virtual food identifies 

itself by its ingredients and quantity. 

  Objects  know  the  identity  of  their  owners.  The  device  that  controls  a  user’s  glucose  level 

should know how that information fits in that user’s overall health.  

Objects  can  also  be  in  groups,  which  some  mechanism  must  manage.  A  house  could  have  several 
appliances  that  only  certain  residents  and  visitors  can  use  at  particular  times.  The  refrigerator  could  lock 
itself after midnight to any resident or visiting teenagers, but remain open for the adults. 

Proving identity is an important part of identity management. As developers create a worldwide network 
of  objects,  they  must  build  an  infrastructure  that  allows  mutual  object  authentication.  There  must  be  a 
balance between centralized management and a distributed, hierarchical approach.  

Mechanisms  for  anonymization  and  the  creation  of  pseudonyms  are  also  important  building  blocks. 
Because the IoT deals with multiple contexts, an entity is not likely to reveal its identity all the time. For 
example, in a vehicular network, a police car can reveal its identity to cars and staff at the police station, 
but keep its identity hidden during undercover work unless it is interacting with other police cars.  

As  these  examples  illustrate,  identify  management  in  the  IoT  offers  both  challenge  and  opportunity  to 
improve security’s practical use. A promising approach is diverse authentication methods for humans and

Objects  that  belong  to  a  virtual  world  can  be  made 
aware of objects outside that world—including the services that other objects and entities provide. Sensors 
that  monitor  agricultural  fields  can  access  weather  reports  for  the  area  and  adapt  the  irrigation  systems 
accordingly.  Developers  can  also  decrease  system  dependence  on  a  centralized  architecture,  creating 
autonomous applications.  Mobile phones  without Internet  connection in a disaster area  can collaborate to 
propagate the location of a sensor-enabled water source.  

This staggered approach might help  society enjoy  IoT’s benefits as analysts and researchers tackle the 
complexities in its underlying infrastructure. The problems will be both technical and semantic, requiring 
interoperable mechanisms that can both connect entities and help them understand each other. Distributed 
services must be reliable, not only offering availability but also adapting themselves in case of malfunction. 
A governance model must scale to billions of devices all over the world. Within these meta challenges are 
issues such as bootstrapping, mobility, scalability, data processing, standardization, and billing.  

COPING WITH OLD AND NEW THREATS 

Not surprisingly, even a staggered approach to developing the IoT presents a daunting task for security. 
What protection measures are possible as billions of intelligent things cooperate with other real and virtual 
entities  in  random  and  unpredictable  ways?  The  IoT’s  highly  distributed  nature  and  use  of  fragile 
technologies, such as limited-function embedded devices in public areas, create weak links that  malicious 
entities  can  exploit.  Easily  accessible  objects  in  unprotected  zones,  such  as  city  streets,  are  vulnerable  to 
physical  harm.  Like  compromising  botnets,  some  objects  would  try  to  hinder  services  from  the  inside. 
Additional threats include the existence of a domino effect between intertwined services and user profiling 
through data collection and other methods. 

To avoid these threats, the IoT must have strong security foundations built on a holistic view of security 
for all IoT elements at all  stages—from the identification  of objects to the provisioning of services,  from 
the  acquisition  of  data  to  the  governance  of  the  whole  infrastructure.  All  security  mechanisms  must 
consider each object’s lifecycle and services from the very beginning of that object’s existence.  

Protocol and network security 

Heterogeneity  greatly  affects  the  protection  of  the  network  infrastructure.  Highly  constrained  devices 
that use low-bandwidth standards, such as IEEE 802.15.4, must open a secure communication channel with 
more  powerful  devices—for  example,  sensor  nodes  scattered  in  a  smart  city  communicate  with 
smartphones  or  PDAs.  Securing  this  channel  requires  optimal  cryptography  algorithms  and  adequate  key 
management  systems,  as  well  as  security  protocols  that  connect  all  these  devices  through  the  Internet. 
Although  it  is  not  clear  how  many  resources  will  be  available  to  such  constrained  devices  once  the  IoT 
truly  takes  off,  it  is  safe  to  optimize  security  as  much  as  possible  to  improve  the  provision  of  future 
services. 

In  a  bottom-up  approach,  cryptography  is  the  cornerstone  for  network  infrastructure  protection. 
Although it is possible to implement existing  standards,  such as  AES,  some IoT devices, such as passive 
RFID tags, might be extremely constrained. Cryptographic mechanisms must be smaller and faster but with 
little  or  no  reduction  in  security  level.  Mechanisms  could  include  symmetric  algorithms,  hash  functions, 
and random number generators.  

In this approach, cryptography is the bricks and the  mortar is the  key-management infrastructures that 
establish  keying  material,  for  example,  shared  secret  keys.  Making  this  mortar  requires  associating 
previously  unrelated  and  sometimes  highly  constrained  objects  in  an  extremely  dynamic  environment. 
Manual  configuration  works  only  in  small  and  personal  environments,  and  traditional  public-key 
infrastructures will almost certainly not scale to accommodate the IoT’s amalgam of contexts and devices. 
There is also the issue of rekeying devices to keep information flow safe in the long run. 

Further  up  the  network  infrastructure  are  the  communication  layers.  Clearly,  the  IoT  must  extensively 
use  Internet  standards  for  communication  and  service  provision.  Still,  some  devices,  such  as  sensors  that 
check the state of runway lights, will lack the resources to implement the Internet security mechanisms that 
normally  protect  these  kinds  of  interactions.  Therefore,  security  protocols  require  some  forward-looking 
adaptation. Subtle differences between IoT and Internet protocols might lead to gaps in end-to-end security. 
Adaptations  should  not  only  fulfill  the  IoT’s  performance  requirements  but  also  provide  the  protocol’s 

original security properties in the context of the Internet architecture.[2] 

Data and privacy 

Privacy is one of  the  most sensitive  subjects in any discussion of IoT protection. The data availability 
explosion has created Big Brother-like entities that profile and track users without their consent. The IoT’s 
anywhere,  anything,  anytime  nature  could  easily  turn  such  practices  into  a  dystopia.  Users  would  have 
access to an unprecedented number of personalized services, all of which would generate considerable data, 
and the environment itself would be able to acquire information about users automatically.  

Although a dystopia is the worst-case scenario, the IoT could certainly exacerbate a range of undesirable 
situations.  Facebook  accounts  already  affect  a  user’s  employability  and  personal  interactions.  Imagine 
exponentially more such exposure opportunities.   

Privacy by design. One viable solution is privacy by design, in which users would have the tools they 
need to manage their own data. The solution is not too far from current reality. Whenever users produce a 
data fragment, they can already use dynamic consent tools that permit certain services to access as little or 
as  much  of  that  data  as  desired.  Taking  that  idea  a  step  further,  a  user  in  Central  Park  could  provide  a 
location-based service with the information that he’s in New York City, but not that he’s in a specific park. 
Transparency.  Transparency  is  also  essential,  since  users  should  know  which  entities  are  managing 
their data and how and when those entities are using it. Stakeholders such as service providers must be part 
of this equation,  which  might  make  take-it-or-leave-it license agreements  obsolete. Businesses  will adjust 
their services according to the amount of personal data the user provides. 

Data  management.  A  huge  issue  is  deciding  who  manages  the  secrets.  Technically,  cryptographic 
mechanisms and protocols protect data throughout the service’s life cycle, but some entities might lack the 
resources  to  manage  such  mechanisms.  In  other  words,  one  data  management  policy  will  not  fit  all 
situations.  Consequently,  there  must be policies on how to  manage  various  kinds of data as  well as  some 
policy-enforcement  mechanism.  Developing  such  data  management  policies  and  enforcing  them  is  not 
trivial. It requires interpreting, translating, and optimally reconciling a series of rules, each of which might 
be  in  a  different  language.  And  any  policies  must  align  with  legislation  on  data  protection,  which  itself 
could change. 

Identity management 

In  the  IoT,  identity  management  requires  considering  a  staggering  variety  of  identity  and  relationship 

types, according to certain object identity principles:  

  An  object’s  identity  is  not  the  same  as  the  identity  of  its  underlying  mechanisms.  The  x-ray 
machine in the radiology department might have an IP address, but it should also have its own 
identity to distinguish it from other machines.  

  An object can have one core identity and several temporary identities. A hospital can become a 

meeting place for a health conference or a shelter after a fire.  

  An object can identify itself using its identity or its specific features. A virtual food identifies 

itself by its ingredients and quantity. 

  Objects  know  the  identity  of  their  owners.  The  device  that  controls  a  user’s  glucose  level 

should know how that information fits in that user’s overall health.  

Objects  can  also  be  in  groups,  which  some  mechanism  must  manage.  A  house  could  have  several 
appliances  that  only  certain  residents  and  visitors  can  use  at  particular  times.  The  refrigerator  could  lock 
itself after midnight to any resident or visiting teenagers, but remain open for the adults. 

Proving identity is an important part of identity management. As developers create a worldwide network 
of  objects,  they  must  build  an  infrastructure  that  allows  mutual  object  authentication.  There  must  be  a 
balance between centralized management and a distributed, hierarchical approach.  

Mechanisms  for  anonymization  and  the  creation  of  pseudonyms  are  also  important  building  blocks. 
Because the IoT deals with multiple contexts, an entity is not likely to reveal its identity all the time. For 
example, in a vehicular network, a police car can reveal its identity to cars and staff at the police station, 
but keep its identity hidden during undercover work unless it is interacting with other police cars.  

As  these  examples  illustrate,  identify  management  in  the  IoT  offers  both  challenge  and  opportunity  to 
improve security’s practical use. A promising approach is diverse authentication methods for humans and 

machines.  A  user  could  open  an  office  door  using  bioidentification  (such  as  a  fingerprint)  or  an  object 
within  a  personal  network,  such  as  a  passport,  identity  card,  or  smartphone.  Combining  authentication 
methods can prevent any loss of overall system security. Such combinations typically take the form of what 
I am + what I know or what I have + what I know. 

Authorization  is  also  an  identity  management  concern.  Authentication  and  authorization  share  open 
research  issues,  such  as  finding  a  balance  between  centralized  and  distributed  systems  to  answer  the 
question of who’s in charge of defining and publishing roles. However, specific topics, such as delegation, 
fall mainly under the authorization umbrella. An IoT element can delegate certain tasks to other objects for 
a limited time. For example, an object in the user’s personal network, such as his phone, can check on his 
behalf to see if his suitcase contains all the clothes needed for an upcoming conference.  

Granularity is also an authorization issue. The services an object provides might depend on the number 
of  credentials  presented.  For  example,  a  classroom  could  provide  anyone  who  asks  with  the  name  of  the 
course  being  taught,  but  it  would  release  the  syllabus  of  that  course  only  to  students  with  authorization 
certificates from the dean. 

Trust and governance 

Trust is essential to implement the IoT. In this context, trust is more than the mechanisms that reduce the 
uncertainty of objects as they interact, although such mechanisms are important in helping objects choose 
an adequate partner for their needs. In the IoT, such mechanisms must be able to define trust in a dynamic, 
collaborative environment and understand what it means to provide trust throughout an interaction. 

But  trust  also  encompasses  how  users  feel  while  interacting  in  the  IoT.  Feelings  of  helplessness  and 
being  under  some  unknown  external  control  can  greatly  undermine  the  deployment  of  IoT-based 
applications and services. There must be support for controlling the state of the virtual world.  Users must 
be able to control their own services, and they must have tools that accurately describe all their interactions 
so that they can form an accurate mental map of their virtual surroundings. 

Governance  helps  strengthen  trust  in  the  IoT.  A  common  framework  for  security  policies  will  support 
interoperability  and  ensure  security’s  continuity.  Defining  adequate  enforcement  mechanisms  will  go  a 
long way toward simplifying data protection.  

A  governance  framework  can  also  help  reduce  liability.  If  someone  can  attribute  a  malicious  action 
transaction  to  a  particular  user  or  agent,  it  will  be  possible  to  punish  that  user  or  the  agent’s  owner.  But 
governance is a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it offers stability, support for political decisions, and 
a  fair  enforcement  mechanism.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily  become  excessive,  fostering  an 
environment in which people are continuously monitored and controlled. If the current Internet’s partially 
solved  governance  problem  is  any  indication,  it  will  take  the  combined  efforts  of  several  research 
communities  to  address  the  challenges  of  a  governance  framework  when  countless  stakeholders  and 
billions of objects are added to the mix. 

Fault tolerance 

Clearly, the IoT will be more susceptible to attack than the current Internet, since billions more devices 
will  be  producing  and  consuming  services.  Highly  constrained  devices  will  be  the  most  vulnerable,  and 
malicious entities will seek to control at least some devices either directly or indirectly. In this context, fault 
tolerance is indispensable to assure service reliability, but any solution must be specialized and lightweight 
to account for the number of constrained and easily accessible IoT devices. 

Achieving fault tolerance in the IoT will require three cooperative efforts. The first is to make all objects 
secure  by  default.  Aside  from  designing  secure  protocols  and  mechanisms,  researchers  must  work  on 
improving software implementation quality, since it  might  not be feasible to provide  a software patch for 
billions of devices.  

The second effort is to give all IoT objects the ability to know the state of the network and its services. 
This system would need to give feedback to many other elements; for example, a watchdog system could 
acquire  data  as  part  of  supplying  qualitative  and  quantitative  security  metrics.  An  important  task  in  this 
second effort is to build an accountability system that will help monitor state. 

Finally, objects should be able to defend themselves against network failures and attacks. All protocols 
should  incorporate  mechanisms  that  respond  to  abnormal  situations  and  allow  the  object  to  gracefully 
degrade  its  service.  Objects  should  be  able  to  use  intrusion-detection  systems  and  other  defensive 
mechanisms to ward off attackers.  

 

 

Securing the Internet of Things

In  the  Internet  of  Things  vision,  every  physical  object  has  a  virtual 
component  that  can  produce  and  consume  services.  Such  extreme 

interconnection will bring unprecedented convenience and economy, but it 

will also require novel approaches to ensure its safe and ethical use. 

In the Internet of Things (IoT), everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and thing 
has  a  locatable,  addressable,  and  readable  counterpart  on  the  Internet.  These  virtual  entities  can  produce 
and consume services and collaborate toward a common goal.  The user’s phone knows about his physical 
and  mental  state  through  a  network  of  devices  that  surround  his  body,  so  it  can  act  on  his  behalf.  The 
embedded  system  in  a  swimming  pool  can  share  its  state  with  other  virtual  entities.  With  these 
characteristics, the IoT promises to extend “anywhere, anyhow, anytime” computing to “anything, anyone, 
any service.” 

Several significant obstacles remain to fulfill the IoT vision, among them security. The Internet and its 
users  are  already  under  continual  attack,  and  a  growing  economy—replete  with  business  models  that 
undermine  the  Internet’s  ethical  use—is  fully  focused  on  exploiting  the  current  version’s  foundational 
weaknesses.  This  does  not  bode  well  for  the  IoT,  which  incorporates  many  constrained  devices.  Indeed, 
realizing the IoT vision is likely to spark novel and ingenious malicious models. The challenge is to prevent 
the growth of such models or at least to mitigate and limit their impact. 

Meeting  this  challenge  requires  understanding  the  characteristics  of  things  and  the  technologies  that 
empower the IoT. Mobile applications are already intensifying users’ interaction with the environment, and 
researchers have made considerable progress in developing sensory devices to provide myriad dimensions 
of information to enrich the user experience.  

However, without strong security foundations, attacks and malfunctions in the IoT will outweigh any of 
its  benefits.  Traditional  protection  mechanisms—lightweight  cryptography,  secure  protocols,  and  privacy 
assurance—are  not  enough.  Rather,  researchers  must  discover  the  full  extent  of  specific  obstacles.  They 
must  analyze  current  security  protocols  and  mechanisms  and  decide  if  such  approaches  are  worth 
integrating into the IoT as is or if adaptations or entirely new designs will better accomplish security goals.  
The  proper  legal  and  technical  framework  is  essential.  To  establish  it,  analysts  must  thoroughly 
understand the risks associated with various IoT scenarios, such as air travel, which has many interrelated 
elements,  including  safety,  privacy,  and  economy[1].  Only  then  is  it  possible  to  justify  the  cost  of 
developing security and privacy mechanisms. 

All  these  requirements  underline  some  critical  first  steps  in  implementing  IoT  security  measures 
successfully: understand the IoT conceptually, evaluate Internet security’s current state, and explore how to 
move  from  solutions  that  meet current requirements and constraints  to those that can reasonably assure a 
secure IoT. 

INFRASTRUCTURE SEEDS 

The “Objects in a Superconnected World” sidebar describes some of the characteristics of the things in 
the envisioned IoT and some existing applications that are arguably partial IoT instances. The path to the 
IoT is not necessary a single step. In fact, it makes far more sense to gradually incorporate IoT applications 
into  the  real  world  by  giving  objects  virtual  personas  and  thinking  outside  the  box.  For  example, 
researchers  could  enhance  fishing  vessels  with  sensors  and  communication  systems  that  offer  shared

Objects  that  belong  to  a  virtual  world  can  be  made

be able to control their own services, and they must have tools that accurately describe all their interactions 
so that they can form an accurate mental map of their virtual surroundings. 

Governance  helps  strengthen  trust  in  the  IoT.  A  common  framework  for  security  policies  will  support 
interoperability  and  ensure  security’s  continuity.  Defining  adequate  enforcement  mechanisms  will  go  a 
long way toward simplifying data protection.  

A  governance  framework  can  also  help  reduce  liability.  If  someone  can  attribute  a  malicious  action 
transaction  to  a  particular  user  or  agent,  it  will  be  possible  to  punish  that  user  or  the  agent’s  owner.  But 
governance is a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it offers stability, support for political decisions, and 
a  fair  enforcement  mechanism.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily  become  excessive,  fostering  an 
environment in which people are continuously monitored and controlled. If the current Internet’s partially 
solved  governance  problem  is  any  indication,  it  will  take  the  combined  efforts  of  several  research 
communities  to  address  the  challenges  of  a  governance  framework  when  countless  stakeholders  and 
billions of objects are added to the mix. 

Fault tolerance 

Clearly, the IoT will be more susceptible to attack than the current Internet, since billions more devices 
will  be  producing  and  consuming  services.  Highly  constrained  devices  will  be  the  most  vulnerable,  and 
malicious entities will seek to control at least some devices either directly or indirectly. In this context, fault 
tolerance is indispensable to assure service reliability, but any solution must be specialized and lightweight 
to account for the number of constrained and easily accessible IoT devices. 

Achieving fault tolerance in the IoT will require three cooperative efforts. The first is to make all objects 
secure  by  default.  Aside  from  designing  secure  protocols  and  mechanisms,  researchers  must  work  on 
improving software implementation quality, since it  might  not be feasible to provide  a software patch for 
billions of devices.  

The second effort is to give all IoT objects the ability to know the state of the network and its services. 
This system would need to give feedback to many other elements; for example, a watchdog system could 
acquire  data  as  part  of  supplying  qualitative  and  quantitative  security  metrics.  An  important  task  in  this 
second effort is to build an accountability system that will help monitor state. 

Finally, objects should be able to defend themselves against network failures and attacks. All protocols 
should  incorporate  mechanisms  that  respond  to  abnormal  situations  and  allow  the  object  to  gracefully 
degrade  its  service.  Objects  should  be  able  to  use  intrusion-detection  systems  and  other  defensive 
mechanisms to ward off attackers.  

Once  an  attack  affects  their  services,  IoT  elements  should  be  able  to  act  quickly  to  recover  from  any 
damage.  Such elements can  use  feedback  from other  mechanisms and IoT entities  to  map the  location of 
unsafe  zones,  where  an  attack  has  caused  service  outages,  and  trusted  zones—areas  with  no  service 
outages.  Such  information  can  be  the  basis  for  implementing  various  recovery  services,  such  as  having 
objects access trusted zone services first. Mechanisms could also inform human operators of any damaged 
zone and then perform maintenance operations. This infrastructure self-management is a key IoT tenet. 

WORK IN PROGRESS 

Researchers,  governments,  and  industries  are  committed  to  developing  and  standardizing  identity  and 
security mechanisms for IoT building blocks. Table 1 lists some of the more mature efforts. The table does 
not  consider  work-in-progress  standards  and  government  recommendations  such  as  EU  recommendation 
C(2009) 3200.  

Although these standards and mechanisms are good first steps, much additional work is required to build 
a robust and secure IoT. Again, the holistic view is important. It is important to protect the IoT’s building 
blocks, but its features create new requirements that are equally important. The design of specific security 
IoT  mechanisms  is  still  in  its  infancy,  but  recent  developments  are  encouraging  and  could  provide  some 
degree of protection to existing IoT applications, such as the different instances of the IBM Smarter Planet 
initiative 
(www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/?ca=v_smarterplanet)  or  ventures  such  as  Pachube

Cryptography and protocols 

Researchers  are  already  making  strides  toward  developing  better  cryptographic  algorithms  and  modes 
for  IoT  devices.  The  ISO/IEC  29192  standards  aim  to  provide  lightweight  cryptography  for  constrained 
devices,  including  block  and  stream  ciphers  and  asymmetric  mechanisms.  As  of  August  2011,  these 
standards  were  still  under  development,  but  some  algorithms  are  available.  Sony’s  CLEFIA  is  a  novel 
block  cipher  that  supports  128-bit  keys  (www.sony.net/Products/cryptography/clefia/about/index.html).

Securing the Internet of Things

In  the  Internet  of  Things  vision,  every  physical  object  has  a  virtual 
component  that  can  produce  and  consume  services.  Such  extreme 

interconnection will bring unprecedented convenience and economy, but it 

will also require novel approaches to ensure its safe and ethical use. 

In the Internet of Things (IoT), everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and thing 
has  a  locatable,  addressable,  and  readable  counterpart  on  the  Internet.  These  virtual  entities  can  produce 
and consume services and collaborate toward a common goal.  The user’s phone knows about his physical 
and  mental  state  through  a  network  of  devices  that  surround  his  body,  so  it  can  act  on  his  behalf.  The 
embedded  system  in  a  swimming  pool  can  share  its  state  with  other  virtual  entities.  With  these 
characteristics, the IoT promises to extend “anywhere, anyhow, anytime” computing to “anything, anyone, 
any service.” 

Several significant obstacles remain to fulfill the IoT vision, among them security. The Internet and its 
users  are  already  under  continual  attack,  and  a  growing  economy—replete  with  business  models  that 
undermine  the  Internet’s  ethical  use—is  fully  focused  on  exploiting  the  current  version’s  foundational 
weaknesses.  This  does  not  bode  well  for  the  IoT,  which  incorporates  many  constrained  devices.  Indeed, 
realizing the IoT vision is likely to spark novel and ingenious malicious models. The challenge is to prevent 
the growth of such models or at least to mitigate and limit their impact. 

Meeting  this  challenge  requires  understanding  the  characteristics  of  things  and  the  technologies  that 
empower the IoT. Mobile applications are already intensifying users’ interaction with the environment, and 
researchers have made considerable progress in developing sensory devices to provide myriad dimensions 
of information to enrich the user experience.  

However, without strong security foundations, attacks and malfunctions in the IoT will outweigh any of 
its  benefits.  Traditional  protection  mechanisms—lightweight  cryptography,  secure  protocols,  and  privacy 
assurance—are  not  enough.  Rather,  researchers  must  discover  the  full  extent  of  specific  obstacles.  They 
must  analyze  current  security  protocols  and  mechanisms  and  decide  if  such  approaches  are  worth 
integrating into the IoT as is or if adaptations or entirely new designs will better accomplish security goals.  
The  proper  legal  and  technical  framework  is  essential.  To  establish  it,  analysts  must  thoroughly 
understand the risks associated with various IoT scenarios, such as air travel, which has many interrelated 
elements,  including  safety,  privacy,  and  economy[1].  Only  then  is  it  possible  to  justify  the  cost  of 
developing security and privacy mechanisms. 

All  these  requirements  underline  some  critical  first  steps  in  implementing  IoT  security  measures 
successfully: understand the IoT conceptually, evaluate Internet security’s current state, and explore how to 
move  from  solutions  that  meet current requirements and constraints  to those that can reasonably assure a 
secure IoT. 

INFRASTRUCTURE SEEDS 

The “Objects in a Superconnected World” sidebar describes some of the characteristics of the things in 
the envisioned IoT and some existing applications that are arguably partial IoT instances. The path to the 
IoT is not necessary a single step. In fact, it makes far more sense to gradually incorporate IoT applications 
into  the  real  world  by  giving  objects  virtual  personas  and  thinking  outside  the  box.  For  example, 
researchers  could  enhance  fishing  vessels  with  sensors  and  communication  systems  that  offer  shared 

R.Roman,P.Najera,andJ.Lopez,“SecuringtheInternetofThings”,IEEEComputer,vol.44,pp.51-58,2011.http://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2011.291NICSLab.Publications:https://www.nics.uma.es/publicationsservices  about  the  state  of  the  sea  and  other  facets.  Objects  that  belong  to  a  virtual  world  can  be  made 
aware of objects outside that world—including the services that other objects and entities provide. Sensors 
that  monitor  agricultural  fields  can  access  weather  reports  for  the  area  and  adapt  the  irrigation  systems 
accordingly.  Developers  can  also  decrease  system  dependence  on  a  centralized  architecture,  creating 
autonomous applications.  Mobile phones  without Internet  connection in a disaster area  can collaborate to 
propagate the location of a sensor-enabled water source.  

This staggered approach might help  society enjoy  IoT’s benefits as analysts and researchers tackle the 
complexities in its underlying infrastructure. The problems will be both technical and semantic, requiring 
interoperable mechanisms that can both connect entities and help them understand each other. Distributed 
services must be reliable, not only offering availability but also adapting themselves in case of malfunction. 
A governance model must scale to billions of devices all over the world. Within these meta challenges are 
issues such as bootstrapping, mobility, scalability, data processing, standardization, and billing.  

COPING WITH OLD AND NEW THREATS 

Not surprisingly, even a staggered approach to developing the IoT presents a daunting task for security. 
What protection measures are possible as billions of intelligent things cooperate with other real and virtual 
entities  in  random  and  unpredictable  ways?  The  IoT’s  highly  distributed  nature  and  use  of  fragile 
technologies, such as limited-function embedded devices in public areas, create weak links that  malicious 
entities  can  exploit.  Easily  accessible  objects  in  unprotected  zones,  such  as  city  streets,  are  vulnerable  to 
physical  harm.  Like  compromising  botnets,  some  objects  would  try  to  hinder  services  from  the  inside. 
Additional threats include the existence of a domino effect between intertwined services and user profiling 
through data collection and other methods. 

To avoid these threats, the IoT must have strong security foundations built on a holistic view of security 
for all IoT elements at all  stages—from the identification  of objects to the provisioning of services,  from 
the  acquisition  of  data  to  the  governance  of  the  whole  infrastructure.  All  security  mechanisms  must 
consider each object’s lifecycle and services from the very beginning of that object’s existence.  

Protocol and network security 

Heterogeneity  greatly  affects  the  protection  of  the  network  infrastructure.  Highly  constrained  devices 
that use low-bandwidth standards, such as IEEE 802.15.4, must open a secure communication channel with 
more  powerful  devices—for  example,  sensor  nodes  scattered  in  a  smart  city  communicate  with 
smartphones  or  PDAs.  Securing  this  channel  requires  optimal  cryptography  algorithms  and  adequate  key 
management  systems,  as  well  as  security  protocols  that  connect  all  these  devices  through  the  Internet. 
Although  it  is  not  clear  how  many  resources  will  be  available  to  such  constrained  devices  once  the  IoT 
truly  takes  off,  it  is  safe  to  optimize  security  as  much  as  possible  to  improve  the  provision  of  future 
services. 

In  a  bottom-up  approach,  cryptography  is  the  cornerstone  for  network  infrastructure  protection. 
Although it is possible to implement existing  standards,  such as  AES,  some IoT devices, such as passive 
RFID tags, might be extremely constrained. Cryptographic mechanisms must be smaller and faster but with 
little  or  no  reduction  in  security  level.  Mechanisms  could  include  symmetric  algorithms,  hash  functions, 
and random number generators.  

In this approach, cryptography is the bricks and the  mortar is the  key-management infrastructures that 
establish  keying  material,  for  example,  shared  secret  keys.  Making  this  mortar  requires  associating 
previously  unrelated  and  sometimes  highly  constrained  objects  in  an  extremely  dynamic  environment. 
Manual  configuration  works  only  in  small  and  personal  environments,  and  traditional  public-key 
infrastructures will almost certainly not scale to accommodate the IoT’s amalgam of contexts and devices. 
There is also the issue of rekeying devices to keep information flow safe in the long run. 

Further  up  the  network  infrastructure  are  the  communication  layers.  Clearly,  the  IoT  must  extensively 
use  Internet  standards  for  communication  and  service  provision.  Still,  some  devices,  such  as  sensors  that 
check the state of runway lights, will lack the resources to implement the Internet security mechanisms that 
normally  protect  these  kinds  of  interactions.  Therefore,  security  protocols  require  some  forward-looking 
adaptation. Subtle differences between IoT and Internet protocols might lead to gaps in end-to-end security. 
Adaptations  should  not  only  fulfill  the  IoT’s  performance  requirements  but  also  provide  the  protocol’s 

original security properties in the context of the Internet architecture.[2] 

Data and privacy 

Privacy is one of  the  most sensitive  subjects in any discussion of IoT protection. The data availability 
explosion has created Big Brother-like entities that profile and track users without their consent. The IoT’s 
anywhere,  anything,  anytime  nature  could  easily  turn  such  practices  into  a  dystopia.  Users  would  have 
access to an unprecedented number of personalized services, all of which would generate considerable data, 
and the environment itself would be able to acquire information about users automatically.  

Although a dystopia is the worst-case scenario, the IoT could certainly exacerbate a range of undesirable 
situations.  Facebook  accounts  already  affect  a  user’s  employability  and  personal  interactions.  Imagine 
exponentially more such exposure opportunities.   

Privacy by design. One viable solution is privacy by design, in which users would have the tools they 
need to manage their own data. The solution is not too far from current reality. Whenever users produce a 
data fragment, they can already use dynamic consent tools that permit certain services to access as little or 
as  much  of  that  data  as  desired.  Taking  that  idea  a  step  further,  a  user  in  Central  Park  could  provide  a 
location-based service with the information that he’s in New York City, but not that he’s in a specific park. 
Transparency.  Transparency  is  also  essential,  since  users  should  know  which  entities  are  managing 
their data and how and when those entities are using it. Stakeholders such as service providers must be part 
of this equation,  which  might  make  take-it-or-leave-it license agreements  obsolete. Businesses  will adjust 
their services according to the amount of personal data the user provides. 

Data  management.  A  huge  issue  is  deciding  who  manages  the  secrets.  Technically,  cryptographic 
mechanisms and protocols protect data throughout the service’s life cycle, but some entities might lack the 
resources  to  manage  such  mechanisms.  In  other  words,  one  data  management  policy  will  not  fit  all 
situations.  Consequently,  there  must be policies on how to  manage  various  kinds of data as  well as  some 
policy-enforcement  mechanism.  Developing  such  data  management  policies  and  enforcing  them  is  not 
trivial. It requires interpreting, translating, and optimally reconciling a series of rules, each of which might 
be  in  a  different  language.  And  any  policies  must  align  with  legislation  on  data  protection,  which  itself 
could change. 

Identity management 

In  the  IoT,  identity  management  requires  considering  a  staggering  variety  of  identity  and  relationship 

types, according to certain object identity principles:  

  An  object’s  identity  is  not  the  same  as  the  identity  of  its  underlying  mechanisms.  The  x-ray 
machine in the radiology department might have an IP address, but it should also have its own 
identity to distinguish it from other machines.  

  An object can have one core identity and several temporary identities. A hospital can become a 

meeting place for a health conference or a shelter after a fire.  

  An object can identify itself using its identity or its specific features. A virtual food identifies 

itself by its ingredients and quantity. 

  Objects  know  the  identity  of  their  owners.  The  device  that  controls  a  user’s  glucose  level 

should know how that information fits in that user’s overall health.  

Objects  can  also  be  in  groups,  which  some  mechanism  must  manage.  A  house  could  have  several 
appliances  that  only  certain  residents  and  visitors  can  use  at  particular  times.  The  refrigerator  could  lock 
itself after midnight to any resident or visiting teenagers, but remain open for the adults. 

Proving identity is an important part of identity management. As developers create a worldwide network 
of  objects,  they  must  build  an  infrastructure  that  allows  mutual  object  authentication.  There  must  be  a 
balance between centralized management and a distributed, hierarchical approach.  

Mechanisms  for  anonymization  and  the  creation  of  pseudonyms  are  also  important  building  blocks. 
Because the IoT deals with multiple contexts, an entity is not likely to reveal its identity all the time. For 
example, in a vehicular network, a police car can reveal its identity to cars and staff at the police station, 
but keep its identity hidden during undercover work unless it is interacting with other police cars.  

As  these  examples  illustrate,  identify  management  in  the  IoT  offers  both  challenge  and  opportunity  to 
improve security’s practical use. A promising approach is diverse authentication methods for humans and 

machines.  A  user  could  open  an  office  door  using  bioidentification  (such  as  a  fingerprint)  or  an  object 
within  a  personal  network,  such  as  a  passport,  identity  card,  or  smartphone.  Combining  authentication 
methods can prevent any loss of overall system security. Such combinations typically take the form of what 
I am + what I know or what I have + what I know. 

Authorization  is  also  an  identity  management  concern.  Authentication  and  authorization  share  open 
research  issues,  such  as  finding  a  balance  between  centralized  and  distributed  systems  to  answer  the 
question of who’s in charge of defining and publishing roles. However, specific topics, such as delegation, 
fall mainly under the authorization umbrella. An IoT element can delegate certain tasks to other objects for 
a limited time. For example, an object in the user’s personal network, such as his phone, can check on his 
behalf to see if his suitcase contains all the clothes needed for an upcoming conference.  

Granularity is also an authorization issue. The services an object provides might depend on the number 
of  credentials  presented.  For  example,  a  classroom  could  provide  anyone  who  asks  with  the  name  of  the 
course  being  taught,  but  it  would  release  the  syllabus  of  that  course  only  to  students  with  authorization 
certificates from the dean. 

Trust and governance 

Trust is essential to implement the IoT. In this context, trust is more than the mechanisms that reduce the 
uncertainty of objects as they interact, although such mechanisms are important in helping objects choose 
an adequate partner for their needs. In the IoT, such mechanisms must be able to define trust in a dynamic, 
collaborative environment and understand what it means to provide trust throughout an interaction. 

But  trust  also  encompasses  how  users  feel  while  interacting  in  the  IoT.  Feelings  of  helplessness  and 
being  under  some  unknown  external  control  can  greatly  undermine  the  deployment  of  IoT-based 
applications and services. There must be support for controlling the state of the virtual world.  Users must 
be able to control their own services, and they must have tools that accurately describe all their interactions 
so that they can form an accurate mental map of their virtual surroundings. 

Governance  helps  strengthen  trust  in  the  IoT.  A  common  framework  for  security  policies  will  support 
interoperability  and  ensure  security’s  continuity.  Defining  adequate  enforcement  mechanisms  will  go  a 
long way toward simplifying data protection.  

A  governance  framework  can  also  help  reduce  liability.  If  someone  can  attribute  a  malicious  action 
transaction  to  a  particular  user  or  agent,  it  will  be  possible  to  punish  that  user  or  the  agent’s  owner.  But 
governance is a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it offers stability, support for political decisions, and 
a  fair  enforcement  mechanism.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily  become  excessive,  fostering  an 
environment in which people are continuously monitored and controlled. If the current Internet’s partially 
solved  governance  problem  is  any  indication,  it  will  take  the  combined  efforts  of  several  research 
communities  to  address  the  challenges  of  a  governance  framework  when  countless  stakeholders  and 
billions of objects are added to the mix. 

Fault tolerance

will  be  producing  and  consuming  services.  Highly  constrained  devices  will  be  the  most  vulnerable,  and 
malicious entities will seek to control at least some devices either directly or indirectly. In this context, fault

It is already possible to construct lightweight hash functions based on lightweight block ciphers.  As an 
alternative  to  these  lightweight  algorithms,  existing  optimizations  in  operational  modes  can  make  data 
processing more efficient. Both AES-CCM and AES-GCM offer data integrity and confidentiality. Another 
optimization  is  algorithm  management  in  a  cross-layer  architecture,  where  various  security  mechanisms 
share one algorithm.[3] 

Other communities, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, aim to implement Internet standards in 

the IoT. Table 2 lists these standards and their purpose.

Although researchers have met some interim implementation goals, various constraints make it difficult 
to fully achieve security through Internet standards.[2] Developers can tweak the IPsec protocol to provide 
network-layer security between Internet hosts and constrained  devices,[4] but the remaining challenges are 
formidable.  It  will  be  daunting  to  deal  with  the  coexistence  of  strong  link-layer  security  and  IPsec,  for 
example, or the negotiation of keying material. Preshared keys are usable with previously known devices, 
and  public-key  cryptography  is  useful  when  the  constrained  object  behaves  as  a  client,[4]  but  the 
negotiation of dynamic keys between previously unknown entities is still an open problem. 

Identity and ownership  

In certain IoT contexts, single-sign-on (SSO) mechanisms can be useful, since users need to authenticate 
only  once  to  interact  with  various  devices.  However,  traditional  Web  2.0  SSO  such  as  OpenID  and 
Shibboleth were not designed to fulfill certain IoT requirements,[6] such as giving the user control over the 
choice  of  identity  provider.  Other  mechanisms  force  users  to  employ  a  particular  protocol,  which  can  be 
problematic in a heterogeneous environment. Another issue is the lack of support for directional identities, 
in which objects broadcast their identities.  

These issues strongly imply the need to  adapt existing SSO mechanisms or create new ones that better 
fit the IoT. Although some approaches address this need, proposing a hybrid architecture that combines all 
mechanisms through specially crafted middleware,[6] this topic still needs research.  

One approach to verifying device ownership and owner identity is digital shadowing,[7] in which a user 
projects his virtual identity onto logical nodes. Digital shadows are based on the notion that a user’s objects 
act  on  his  behalf  but  do  not  store  his  identity,  only  a  virtual  identity  that  contains  information  about  his 
attributes and the objects’ sessions and interactions  with the architecture. Therefore,  digital shadows only 
implicitly indicate their owner’s identity.  

Figure  1  illustrates  how  digital  shadowing  might  work  with  an  electronic  stethoscope  and  white  coat. 
The  doctor’s  fingerprints  prompt  a  query  to  the  government  database,  while  his  coat  provides  the  digital 
shadow to the hospital database, which checks the doctor’s role. Both authentication aspects (what I am + 
what  I  have)  enable  the  doctor  to  enter  a  certain  hospital  area.  The  stethoscope  records  and  stores  the 
patient’s heartbeats, signs the data on the doctor’s behalf, and stores the data in the hospital database. The 
stethoscope  can  also  check  for  any  heartbeat  anomalies  by  accessing  other  systems  inside  or  outside  the 
hospital. 

 

 

 

Securing the Internet of Things

In  the  Internet  of  Things  vision,  every  physical  object  has  a  virtual 
component  that  can  produce  and  consume  services.  Such  extreme 

interconnection will bring unprecedented convenience and economy, but it 

will also require novel approaches to ensure its safe and ethical use. 

In the Internet of Things (IoT), everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and thing 
has  a  locatable,  addressable,  and  readable  counterpart  on  the  Internet.  These  virtual  entities  can  produce 
and consume services and collaborate toward a common goal.  The user’s phone knows about his physical 
and  mental  state  through  a  network  of  devices  that  surround  his  body,  so  it  can  act  on  his  behalf.  The 
embedded  system  in  a  swimming  pool  can  share  its  state  with  other  virtual  entities.  With  these 
characteristics, the IoT promises to extend “anywhere, anyhow, anytime” computing to “anything, anyone, 
any service.” 

Several significant obstacles remain to fulfill the IoT vision, among them security. The Internet and its 
users  are  already  under  continual  attack,  and  a  growing  economy—replete  with  business  models  that 
undermine  the  Internet’s  ethical  use—is  fully  focused  on  exploiting  the  current  version’s  foundational 
weaknesses.  This  does  not  bode  well  for  the  IoT,  which  incorporates  many  constrained  devices.  Indeed, 
realizing the IoT vision is likely to spark novel and ingenious malicious models. The challenge is to prevent 
the growth of such models or at least to mitigate and limit their impact. 

Meeting  this  challenge  requires  understanding  the  characteristics  of  things  and  the  technologies  that 
empower the IoT. Mobile applications are already intensifying users’ interaction with the environment, and 
researchers have made considerable progress in developing sensory devices to provide myriad dimensions 
of information to enrich the user experience.  

However, without strong security foundations, attacks and malfunctions in the IoT will outweigh any of 
its  benefits.  Traditional  protection  mechanisms—lightweight  cryptography,  secure  protocols,  and  privacy 
assurance—are  not  enough.  Rather,  researchers  must  discover  the  full  extent  of  specific  obstacles.  They 
must  analyze  current  security  protocols  and  mechanisms  and  decide  if  such  approaches  are  worth 
integrating into the IoT as is or if adaptations or entirely new designs will better accomplish security goals.  
The  proper  legal  and  technical  framework  is  essential.  To  establish  it,  analysts  must  thoroughly 
understand the risks associated with various IoT scenarios, such as air travel, which has many interrelated 
elements,  including  safety,  privacy,  and  economy[1].  Only  then  is  it  possible  to  justify  the  cost  of 
developing security and privacy mechanisms. 

All  these  requirements  underline  some  critical  first  steps  in  implementing  IoT  security  measures 
successfully: understand the IoT conceptually, evaluate Internet security’s current state, and explore how to 
move  from  solutions  that  meet current requirements and constraints  to those that can reasonably assure a 
secure IoT. 

INFRASTRUCTURE SEEDS 

The “Objects in a Superconnected World” sidebar describes some of the characteristics of the things in 
the envisioned IoT and some existing applications that are arguably partial IoT instances. The path to the 
IoT is not necessary a single step. In fact, it makes far more sense to gradually incorporate IoT applications 
into  the  real  world  by  giving  objects  virtual  personas  and  thinking  outside  the  box.  For  example, 
researchers  could  enhance  fishing  vessels  with  sensors  and  communication  systems  that  offer  shared 

R.Roman,P.Najera,andJ.Lopez,“SecuringtheInternetofThings”,IEEEComputer,vol.44,pp.51-58,2011.http://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2011.291NICSLab.Publications:https://www.nics.uma.es/publicationsservices  about  the  state  of  the  sea  and  other  facets.  Objects  that  belong  to  a  virtual  world  can  be  made 
aware of objects outside that world—including the services that other objects and entities provide. Sensors 
that  monitor  agricultural  fields  can  access  weather  reports  for  the  area  and  adapt  the  irrigation  systems 
accordingly.  Developers  can  also  decrease  system  dependence  on  a  centralized  architecture,  creating 
autonomous applications.  Mobile phones  without Internet  connection in a disaster area  can collaborate to 
propagate the location of a sensor-enabled water source.  

This staggered approach might help  society enjoy  IoT’s benefits as analysts and researchers tackle the 
complexities in its underlying infrastructure. The problems will be both technical and semantic, requiring 
interoperable mechanisms that can both connect entities and help them understand each other. Distributed 
services must be reliable, not only offering availability but also adapting themselves in case of malfunction. 
A governance model must scale to billions of devices all over the world. Within these meta challenges are 
issues such as bootstrapping, mobility, scalability, data processing, standardization, and billing.  

COPING WITH OLD AND NEW THREATS 

Not surprisingly, even a staggered approach to developing the IoT presents a daunting task for security. 
What protection measures are possible as billions of intelligent things cooperate with other real and virtual 
entities  in  random  and  unpredictable  ways?  The  IoT’s  highly  distributed  nature  and  use  of  fragile 
technologies, such as limited-function embedded devices in public areas, create weak links that  malicious 
entities  can  exploit.  Easily  accessible  objects  in  unprotected  zones,  such  as  city  streets,  are  vulnerable  to 
physical  harm.  Like  compromising  botnets,  some  objects  would  try  to  hinder  services  from  the  inside. 
Additional threats include the existence of a domino effect between intertwined services and user profiling 
through data collection and other methods. 

To avoid these threats, the IoT must have strong security foundations built on a holistic view of security 
for all IoT elements at all  stages—from the identification  of objects to the provisioning of services,  from 
the  acquisition  of  data  to  the  governance  of  the  whole  infrastructure.  All  security  mechanisms  must 
consider each object’s lifecycle and services from the very beginning of that object’s existence.  

Protocol and network security 

Heterogeneity  greatly  affects  the  protection  of  the  network  infrastructure.  Highly  constrained  devices 
that use low-bandwidth standards, such as IEEE 802.15.4, must open a secure communication channel with 
more  powerful  devices—for  example,  sensor  nodes  scattered  in  a  smart  city  communicate  with 
smartphones  or  PDAs.  Securing  this  channel  requires  optimal  cryptography  algorithms  and  adequate  key 
management  systems,  as  well  as  security  protocols  that  connect  all  these  devices  through  the  Internet. 
Although  it  is  not  clear  how  many  resources  will  be  available  to  such  constrained  devices  once  the  IoT 
truly  takes  off,  it  is  safe  to  optimize  security  as  much  as  possible  to  improve  the  provision  of  future 
services. 

In  a  bottom-up  approach,  cryptography  is  the  cornerstone  for  network  infrastructure  protection. 
Although it is possible to implement existing  standards,  such as  AES,  some IoT devices, such as passive 
RFID tags, might be extremely constrained. Cryptographic mechanisms must be smaller and faster but with 
little  or  no  reduction  in  security  level.  Mechanisms  could  include  symmetric  algorithms,  hash  functions, 
and random number generators.  

In this approach, cryptography is the bricks and the  mortar is the  key-management infrastructures that 
establish  keying  material,  for  example,  shared  secret  keys.  Making  this  mortar  requires  associating 
previously  unrelated  and  sometimes  highly  constrained  objects  in  an  extremely  dynamic  environment. 
Manual  configuration  works  only  in  small  and  personal  environments,  and  traditional  public-key 
infrastructures will almost certainly not scale to accommodate the IoT’s amalgam of contexts and devices. 
There is also the issue of rekeying devices to keep information flow safe in the long run. 

Further  up  the  network  infrastructure  are  the  communication  layers.  Clearly,  the  IoT  must  extensively 
use  Internet  standards  for  communication  and  service  provision.  Still,  some  devices,  such  as  sensors  that 
check the state of runway lights, will lack the resources to implement the Internet security mechanisms that 
normally  protect  these  kinds  of  interactions.  Therefore,  security  protocols  require  some  forward-looking 
adaptation. Subtle differences between IoT and Internet protocols might lead to gaps in end-to-end security. 
Adaptations  should  not  only  fulfill  the  IoT’s  performance  requirements  but  also  provide  the  protocol’s 

original security properties in the context of the Internet architecture.[2] 

Data and privacy 

Privacy is one of  the  most sensitive  subjects in any discussion of IoT protection. The data availability 
explosion has created Big Brother-like entities that profile and track users without their consent. The IoT’s 
anywhere,  anything,  anytime  nature  could  easily  turn  such  practices  into  a  dystopia.  Users  would  have 
access to an unprecedented number of personalized services, all of which would generate considerable data, 
and the environment itself would be able to acquire information about users automatically.  

Although a dystopia is the worst-case scenario, the IoT could certainly exacerbate a range of undesirable 
situations.  Facebook  accounts  already  affect  a  user’s  employability  and  personal  interactions.  Imagine 
exponentially more such exposure opportunities.   

Privacy by design. One viable solution is privacy by design, in which users would have the tools they 
need to manage their own data. The solution is not too far from current reality. Whenever users produce a 
data fragment, they can already use dynamic consent tools that permit certain services to access as little or 
as  much  of  that  data  as  desired.  Taking  that  idea  a  step  further,  a  user  in  Central  Park  could  provide  a 
location-based service with the information that he’s in New York City, but not that he’s in a specific park. 
Transparency.  Transparency  is  also  essential,  since  users  should  know  which  entities  are  managing 
their data and how and when those entities are using it. Stakeholders such as service providers must be part 
of this equation,  which  might  make  take-it-or-leave-it license agreements  obsolete. Businesses  will adjust 
their services according to the amount of personal data the user provides. 

Data  management.  A  huge  issue  is  deciding  who  manages  the  secrets.  Technically,  cryptographic 
mechanisms and protocols protect data throughout the service’s life cycle, but some entities might lack the 
resources  to  manage  such  mechanisms.  In  other  words,  one  data  management  policy  will  not  fit  all 
situations.  Consequently,  there  must be policies on how to  manage  various  kinds of data as  well as  some 
policy-enforcement  mechanism.  Developing  such  data  management  policies  and  enforcing  them  is  not 
trivial. It requires interpreting, translating, and optimally reconciling a series of rules, each of which might 
be  in  a  different  language.  And  any  policies  must  align  with  legislation  on  data  protection,  which  itself 
could change. 

Identity management 

In  the  IoT,  identity  management  requires  considering  a  staggering  variety  of  identity  and  relationship 

types, according to certain object identity principles:  

  An  object’s  identity  is  not  the  same  as  the  identity  of  its  underlying  mechanisms.  The  x-ray 
machine in the radiology department might have an IP address, but it should also have its own 
identity to distinguish it from other machines.  

  An object can have one core identity and several temporary identities. A hospital can become a 

meeting place for a health conference or a shelter after a fire.  

  An object can identify itself using its identity or its specific features. A virtual food identifies 

itself by its ingredients and quantity. 

  Objects  know  the  identity  of  their  owners.  The  device  that  controls  a  user’s  glucose  level 

should know how that information fits in that user’s overall health.  

Objects  can  also  be  in  groups,  which  some  mechanism  must  manage.  A  house  could  have  several 
appliances  that  only  certain  residents  and  visitors  can  use  at  particular  times.  The  refrigerator  could  lock 
itself after midnight to any resident or visiting teenagers, but remain open for the adults. 

Proving identity is an important part of identity management. As developers create a worldwide network 
of  objects,  they  must  build  an  infrastructure  that  allows  mutual  object  authentication.  There  must  be  a 
balance between centralized management and a distributed, hierarchical approach.  

Mechanisms  for  anonymization  and  the  creation  of  pseudonyms  are  also  important  building  blocks. 
Because the IoT deals with multiple contexts, an entity is not likely to reveal its identity all the time. For 
example, in a vehicular network, a police car can reveal its identity to cars and staff at the police station, 
but keep its identity hidden during undercover work unless it is interacting with other police cars.  

As  these  examples  illustrate,  identify  management  in  the  IoT  offers  both  challenge  and  opportunity  to 
improve security’s practical use. A promising approach is diverse authentication methods for humans and 

machines.  A  user  could  open  an  office  door  using  bioidentification  (such  as  a  fingerprint)  or  an  object 
within  a  personal  network,  such  as  a  passport,  identity  card,  or  smartphone.  Combining  authentication 
methods can prevent any loss of overall system security. Such combinations typically take the form of what 
I am + what I know or what I have + what I know. 

Authorization  is  also  an  identity  management  concern.  Authentication  and  authorization  share  open 
research  issues,  such  as  finding  a  balance  between  centralized  and  distributed  systems  to  answer  the 
question of who’s in charge of defining and publishing roles. However, specific topics, such as delegation, 
fall mainly under the authorization umbrella. An IoT element can delegate certain tasks to other objects for 
a limited time. For example, an object in the user’s personal network, such as his phone, can check on his 
behalf to see if his suitcase contains all the clothes needed for an upcoming conference.  

Granularity is also an authorization issue. The services an object provides might depend on the number 
of  credentials  presented.  For  example,  a  classroom  could  provide  anyone  who  asks  with  the  name  of  the 
course  being  taught,  but  it  would  release  the  syllabus  of  that  course  only  to  students  with  authorization 
certificates from the dean. 

Trust and governance 

Trust is essential to implement the IoT. In this context, trust is more than the mechanisms that reduce the 
uncertainty of objects as they interact, although such mechanisms are important in helping objects choose 
an adequate partner for their needs. In the IoT, such mechanisms must be able to define trust in a dynamic, 
collaborative environment and understand what it means to provide trust throughout an interaction. 

But  trust  also  encompasses  how  users  feel  while  interacting  in  the  IoT.  Feelings  of  helplessness  and 
being  under  some  unknown  external  control  can  greatly  undermine  the  deployment  of  IoT-based 
applications and services. There must be support for controlling the state of the virtual world.  Users must 
be able to control their own services, and they must have tools that accurately describe all their interactions 
so that they can form an accurate mental map of their virtual surroundings. 

Governance  helps  strengthen  trust  in  the  IoT.  A  common  framework  for  security  policies  will  support 
interoperability  and  ensure  security’s  continuity.  Defining  adequate  enforcement  mechanisms  will  go  a 
long way toward simplifying data protection.  

A  governance  framework  can  also  help  reduce  liability.  If  someone  can  attribute  a  malicious  action 
transaction  to  a  particular  user  or  agent,  it  will  be  possible  to  punish  that  user  or  the  agent’s  owner.  But 
governance is a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it offers stability, support for political decisions, and 
a  fair  enforcement  mechanism.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily  become  excessive,  fostering  an 
environment in which people are continuously monitored and controlled. If the current Internet’s partially 
solved  governance  problem  is  any  indication,  it  will  take  the  combined  efforts  of  several  research 
communities  to  address  the  challenges  of  a  governance  framework  when  countless  stakeholders  and 
billions of objects are added to the mix. 

Fault tolerance 

Clearly, the IoT will be more susceptible to attack than the current Internet, since billions more devices 
will  be  producing  and  consuming  services.  Highly  constrained  devices  will  be  the  most  vulnerable,  and 
malicious entities will seek to control at least some devices either directly or indirectly. In this context, fault 
tolerance is indispensable to assure service reliability, but any solution must be specialized and lightweight 
to account for the number of constrained and easily accessible IoT devices. 

Achieving fault tolerance in the IoT will require three cooperative efforts. The first is to make all objects 
secure  by  default.  Aside  from  designing  secure  protocols  and  mechanisms,  researchers  must  work  on 
improving software implementation quality, since it  might  not be feasible to provide  a software patch for 
billions of devices.  

The second effort is to give all IoT objects the ability to know the state of the network and its services. 
This system would need to give feedback to many other elements; for example, a watchdog system could 
acquire  data  as  part  of  supplying  qualitative  and  quantitative  security  metrics.  An  important  task  in  this 
second effort is to build an accountability system that will help monitor state. 

Finally, objects should be able to defend themselves against network failures and attacks. All protocols 
should  incorporate  mechanisms  that  respond  to  abnormal  situations  and  allow  the  object  to  gracefully 
degrade  its  service.  Objects  should  be  able  to  use  intrusion-detection  systems  and  other  defensive 
mechanisms to ward off attackers.  

Once  an  attack  affects  their  services,  IoT  elements  should  be  able  to  act  quickly  to  recover  from  any 
damage.  Such elements can  use  feedback  from other  mechanisms and IoT entities  to  map the  location of 
unsafe  zones,  where  an  attack  has  caused  service  outages,  and  trusted  zones—areas  with  no  service 
outages.  Such  information  can  be  the  basis  for  implementing  various  recovery  services,  such  as  having 
objects access trusted zone services first. Mechanisms could also inform human operators of any damaged 
zone and then perform maintenance operations. This infrastructure self-management is a key IoT tenet. 

WORK IN PROGRESS 

Researchers,  governments,  and  industries  are  committed  to  developing  and  standardizing  identity  and 
security mechanisms for IoT building blocks. Table 1 lists some of the more mature efforts. The table does 
not  consider  work-in-progress  standards  and  government  recommendations  such  as  EU  recommendation 
C(2009) 3200.  

Although these standards and mechanisms are good first steps, much additional work is required to build 
a robust and secure IoT. Again, the holistic view is important. It is important to protect the IoT’s building 
blocks, but its features create new requirements that are equally important. The design of specific security 
IoT  mechanisms  is  still  in  its  infancy,  but  recent  developments  are  encouraging  and  could  provide  some 
degree of protection to existing IoT applications, such as the different instances of the IBM Smarter Planet 
initiative 
(www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/?ca=v_smarterplanet)  or  ventures  such  as  Pachube 
(https://pachube.com) and Arrayent (http://arrayent.com).

Cryptography and protocols 

Researchers  are  already  making  strides  toward  developing  better  cryptographic  algorithms  and  modes 
for  IoT  devices.  The  ISO/IEC  29192  standards  aim  to  provide  lightweight  cryptography  for  constrained 
devices,  including  block  and  stream  ciphers  and  asymmetric  mechanisms.  As  of  August  2011,  these 
standards  were  still  under  development,  but  some  algorithms  are  available.  Sony’s  CLEFIA  is  a  novel 
block  cipher  that  supports  128-bit  keys  (www.sony.net/Products/cryptography/clefia/about/index.html). 
The  eSTREAM  project  (www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream)  studied  the  robustness  of  stream  ciphers  such  as 
Salsa20/12 and Trivium, which are extremely useful in embedded systems. 

Research  on  lightweight  dedicated  hash  functions  has  just  started.  The  winner  of  the  SHA-3 
competition—scheduled to finish in late 2012—should lay the foundation for more work on a new class of 
hash  functions  for  long-term  security.  The  competition’s  goal  is  to  develop  a  new  cryptographic  hash 
algorithm  that  converts  a  variable  length  message  into  a  short  message  digest.  The  digest  will  be  part  of 
generating  digital  signatures,  message  authentication  codes,  and  many  other  security  applications  in  the 

information infrastructure (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/index.html). 

It is already possible to construct lightweight hash functions based on lightweight block ciphers.  As an 
alternative  to  these  lightweight  algorithms,  existing  optimizations  in  operational  modes  can  make  data 
processing more efficient. Both AES-CCM and AES-GCM offer data integrity and confidentiality. Another 
optimization  is  algorithm  management  in  a  cross-layer  architecture,  where  various  security  mechanisms 
share one algorithm.[3] 

Other communities, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, aim to implement Internet standards in 

the IoT. Table 2 lists these standards and their purpose.

Although researchers have met some interim implementation goals, various constraints make it difficult 
to fully achieve security through Internet standards.[2] Developers can tweak the IPsec protocol to provide 
network-layer security between Internet hosts and constrained  devices,[4] but the remaining challenges are 
formidable.  It  will  be  daunting  to  deal  with  the  coexistence  of  strong  link-layer  security  and  IPsec,  for 
example, or the negotiation of keying material. Preshared keys are usable with previously known devices, 
and  public-key  cryptography  is  useful  when  the  constrained  object  behaves  as  a  client,[4]  but  the 
negotiation of dynamic keys between previously unknown entities is still an open problem. 

Identity and ownership  

In certain IoT contexts, single-sign-on (SSO) mechanisms can be useful, since users need to authenticate 
only  once  to  interact  with  various  devices.  However,  traditional  Web  2.0  SSO  such  as  OpenID  and 
Shibboleth were not designed to fulfill certain IoT requirements,[6] such as giving the user control over the 
choice  of  identity  provider.  Other  mechanisms  force  users  to  employ  a  particular  protocol,  which  can  be 
problematic in a heterogeneous environment. Another issue is the lack of support for directional identities, 
in which objects broadcast their identities.  

These issues strongly imply the need to  adapt existing SSO mechanisms or create new ones that better 
fit the IoT. Although some approaches address this need, proposing a hybrid architecture that combines all 
mechanisms through specially crafted middleware,[6] this topic still needs research.  

One approach to verifying device ownership and owner identity is digital shadowing,[7] in which a user 
projects his virtual identity onto logical nodes. Digital shadows are based on the notion that a user’s objects 
act  on  his  behalf  but  do  not  store  his  identity,  only  a  virtual  identity  that  contains  information  about  his 
attributes and the objects’ sessions and interactions  with the architecture. Therefore,  digital shadows only 
implicitly indicate their owner’s identity.  

Figure  1  illustrates  how  digital  shadowing  might  work  with  an  electronic  stethoscope  and  white  coat. 
The  doctor’s  fingerprints  prompt  a  query  to  the  government  database,  while  his  coat  provides  the  digital 
shadow to the hospital database, which checks the doctor’s role. Both authentication aspects (what I am + 
what  I  have)  enable  the  doctor  to  enter  a  certain  hospital  area.  The  stethoscope  records  and  stores  the 
patient’s heartbeats, signs the data on the doctor’s behalf, and stores the data in the hospital database. The 
stethoscope  can  also  check  for  any  heartbeat  anomalies  by  accessing  other  systems  inside  or  outside  the 
hospital.

The  coat  and  fingerprint  authentication  scenario  in  Figure  1  might  also  benefit  from  revocable  access 
delegation,[8]  in  which  an  RFID  tag  (the  logical  node)  returns  a  valid  ID  (the  virtual  identity)  only  if  the 
tag’s owner has authorized the reader. These tags are essentially part of the user’s digital shadow because 
they provide no user information (only a number), but any reader with explicit user authorization will know 
that they belong to that user. Because the tags’ ID is not easy to link to its owner and the user can revoke 
authorization at any time, the digital shadow approach also accounts for privacy. 

Privacy protection  

Various approaches are in development to protect the personal information of IoT users. The delegation 
mechanism is one privacy preservation proposal. An unauthorized RFID reader will retrieve only a random 
value, so it will not be able to track the user.  

However, limiting access to the user is not the only protection scenario. In some cases, users will want 
to provide information without revealing too much about themselves. Some solutions in this context let the 
user find others who best match  his preferences, without actually revealing such preferences to everyone. 
Other  schemes  let  users  maintain  their  location  privacy  even  when  making  location-dependent  queries.[9] 
Thus, a user can try to locate someone in the vicinity who likes Beethoven, without explicitly providing his 
own location and music preferences.  

An interesting idea is the privacy coach,[10] in which an RFID reader in a mobile phone scans the tags 
embedded  in  some  object,  such  as  a  loyalty  card,  and  downloads  the  companion  privacy  policy.  If  the 
object’s  privacy  policy  does  not  match  the  user’s  preferences,  the  user  can  choose  not  to  use  the  object. 
Conversely,  whenever  an  RFID  reader  tries  to  read  the  mobile  phone’s  signal,  the  phone  can  check  the 
reader’s privacy policy  and ask  for user consent. Finally, the privacy coach can protect the  user’s private 
physical space, such as a house, by scanning for malicious items or undesirable entities, such as objects left 
to monitor the house without the user’s permission.[11] 

 

 

Securing the Internet of Things

In  the  Internet  of  Things  vision,  every  physical  object  has  a  virtual 
component  that  can  produce  and  consume  services.  Such  extreme 

interconnection will bring unprecedented convenience and economy, but it 

will also require novel approaches to ensure its safe and ethical use. 

In the Internet of Things (IoT), everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and thing 
has  a  locatable,  addressable,  and  readable  counterpart  on  the  Internet.  These  virtual  entities  can  produce 
and consume services and collaborate toward a common goal.  The user’s phone knows about his physical 
and  mental  state  through  a  network  of  devices  that  surround  his  body,  so  it  can  act  on  his  behalf.  The 
embedded  system  in  a  swimming  pool  can  share  its  state  with  other  virtual  entities.  With  these 
characteristics, the IoT promises to extend “anywhere, anyhow, anytime” computing to “anything, anyone, 
any service.” 

Several significant obstacles remain to fulfill the IoT vision, among them security. The Internet and its 
users  are  already  under  continual  attack,  and  a  growing  economy—replete  with  business  models  that 
undermine  the  Internet’s  ethical  use—is  fully  focused  on  exploiting  the  current  version’s  foundational 
weaknesses.  This  does  not  bode  well  for  the  IoT,  which  incorporates  many  constrained  devices.  Indeed, 
realizing the IoT vision is likely to spark novel and ingenious malicious models. The challenge is to prevent 
the growth of such models or at least to mitigate and limit their impact. 

Meeting  this  challenge  requires  understanding  the  characteristics  of  things  and  the  technologies  that 
empower the IoT. Mobile applications are already intensifying users’ interaction with the environment, and 
researchers have made considerable progress in developing sensory devices to provide myriad dimensions 
of information to enrich the user experience.  

However, without strong security foundations, attacks and malfunctions in the IoT will outweigh any of 
its  benefits.  Traditional  protection  mechanisms—lightweight  cryptography,  secure  protocols,  and  privacy 
assurance—are  not  enough.  Rather,  researchers  must  discover  the  full  extent  of  specific  obstacles.  They 
must  analyze  current  security  protocols  and  mechanisms  and  decide  if  such  approaches  are  worth 
integrating into the IoT as is or if adaptations or entirely new designs will better accomplish security goals.  
The  proper  legal  and  technical  framework  is  essential.  To  establish  it,  analysts  must  thoroughly 
understand the risks associated with various IoT scenarios, such as air travel, which has many interrelated 
elements,  including  safety,  privacy,  and  economy[1].  Only  then  is  it  possible  to  justify  the  cost  of 
developing security and privacy mechanisms. 

All  these  requirements  underline  some  critical  first  steps  in  implementing  IoT  security  measures 
successfully: understand the IoT conceptually, evaluate Internet security’s current state, and explore how to 
move  from  solutions  that  meet current requirements and constraints  to those that can reasonably assure a 
secure IoT. 

INFRASTRUCTURE SEEDS 

The “Objects in a Superconnected World” sidebar describes some of the characteristics of the things in 
the envisioned IoT and some existing applications that are arguably partial IoT instances. The path to the 
IoT is not necessary a single step. In fact, it makes far more sense to gradually incorporate IoT applications 
into  the  real  world  by  giving  objects  virtual  personas  and  thinking  outside  the  box.  For  example, 
researchers  could  enhance  fishing  vessels  with  sensors  and  communication  systems  that  offer  shared 

R.Roman,P.Najera,andJ.Lopez,“SecuringtheInternetofThings”,IEEEComputer,vol.44,pp.51-58,2011.http://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2011.291NICSLab.Publications:https://www.nics.uma.es/publicationsservices  about  the  state  of  the  sea  and  other  facets.  Objects  that  belong  to  a  virtual  world  can  be  made 
aware of objects outside that world—including the services that other objects and entities provide. Sensors 
that  monitor  agricultural  fields  can  access  weather  reports  for  the  area  and  adapt  the  irrigation  systems 
accordingly.  Developers  can  also  decrease  system  dependence  on  a  centralized  architecture,  creating 
autonomous applications.  Mobile phones  without Internet  connection in a disaster area  can collaborate to 
propagate the location of a sensor-enabled water source.  

This staggered approach might help  society enjoy  IoT’s benefits as analysts and researchers tackle the 
complexities in its underlying infrastructure. The problems will be both technical and semantic, requiring 
interoperable mechanisms that can both connect entities and help them understand each other. Distributed 
services must be reliable, not only offering availability but also adapting themselves in case of malfunction. 
A governance model must scale to billions of devices all over the world. Within these meta challenges are 
issues such as bootstrapping, mobility, scalability, data processing, standardization, and billing.  

COPING WITH OLD AND NEW THREATS 

Not surprisingly, even a staggered approach to developing the IoT presents a daunting task for security. 
What protection measures are possible as billions of intelligent things cooperate with other real and virtual 
entities  in  random  and  unpredictable  ways?  The  IoT’s  highly  distributed  nature  and  use  of  fragile 
technologies, such as limited-function embedded devices in public areas, create weak links that  malicious 
entities  can  exploit.  Easily  accessible  objects  in  unprotected  zones,  such  as  city  streets,  are  vulnerable  to 
physical  harm.  Like  compromising  botnets,  some  objects  would  try  to  hinder  services  from  the  inside. 
Additional threats include the existence of a domino effect between intertwined services and user profiling 
through data collection and other methods. 

To avoid these threats, the IoT must have strong security foundations built on a holistic view of security 
for all IoT elements at all  stages—from the identification  of objects to the provisioning of services,  from 
the  acquisition  of  data  to  the  governance  of  the  whole  infrastructure.  All  security  mechanisms  must 
consider each object’s lifecycle and services from the very beginning of that object’s existence.  

Protocol and network security 

Heterogeneity  greatly  affects  the  protection  of  the  network  infrastructure.  Highly  constrained  devices 
that use low-bandwidth standards, such as IEEE 802.15.4, must open a secure communication channel with 
more  powerful  devices—for  example,  sensor  nodes  scattered  in  a  smart  city  communicate  with 
smartphones  or  PDAs.  Securing  this  channel  requires  optimal  cryptography  algorithms  and  adequate  key 
management  systems,  as  well  as  security  protocols  that  connect  all  these  devices  through  the  Internet. 
Although  it  is  not  clear  how  many  resources  will  be  available  to  such  constrained  devices  once  the  IoT 
truly  takes  off,  it  is  safe  to  optimize  security  as  much  as  possible  to  improve  the  provision  of  future 
services. 

In  a  bottom-up  approach,  cryptography  is  the  cornerstone  for  network  infrastructure  protection. 
Although it is possible to implement existing  standards,  such as  AES,  some IoT devices, such as passive 
RFID tags, might be extremely constrained. Cryptographic mechanisms must be smaller and faster but with 
little  or  no  reduction  in  security  level.  Mechanisms  could  include  symmetric  algorithms,  hash  functions, 
and random number generators.  

In this approach, cryptography is the bricks and the  mortar is the  key-management infrastructures that 
establish  keying  material,  for  example,  shared  secret  keys.  Making  this  mortar  requires  associating 
previously  unrelated  and  sometimes  highly  constrained  objects  in  an  extremely  dynamic  environment. 
Manual  configuration  works  only  in  small  and  personal  environments,  and  traditional  public-key 
infrastructures will almost certainly not scale to accommodate the IoT’s amalgam of contexts and devices. 
There is also the issue of rekeying devices to keep information flow safe in the long run. 

Further  up  the  network  infrastructure  are  the  communication  layers.  Clearly,  the  IoT  must  extensively 
use  Internet  standards  for  communication  and  service  provision.  Still,  some  devices,  such  as  sensors  that 
check the state of runway lights, will lack the resources to implement the Internet security mechanisms that 
normally  protect  these  kinds  of  interactions.  Therefore,  security  protocols  require  some  forward-looking 
adaptation. Subtle differences between IoT and Internet protocols might lead to gaps in end-to-end security. 
Adaptations  should  not  only  fulfill  the  IoT’s  performance  requirements  but  also  provide  the  protocol’s 

original security properties in the context of the Internet architecture.[2] 

Data and privacy 

Privacy is one of  the  most sensitive  subjects in any discussion of IoT protection. The data availability 
explosion has created Big Brother-like entities that profile and track users without their consent. The IoT’s 
anywhere,  anything,  anytime  nature  could  easily  turn  such  practices  into  a  dystopia.  Users  would  have 
access to an unprecedented number of personalized services, all of which would generate considerable data, 
and the environment itself would be able to acquire information about users automatically.  

Although a dystopia is the worst-case scenario, the IoT could certainly exacerbate a range of undesirable 
situations.  Facebook  accounts  already  affect  a  user’s  employability  and  personal  interactions.  Imagine 
exponentially more such exposure opportunities.   

Privacy by design. One viable solution is privacy by design, in which users would have the tools they 
need to manage their own data. The solution is not too far from current reality. Whenever users produce a 
data fragment, they can already use dynamic consent tools that permit certain services to access as little or 
as  much  of  that  data  as  desired.  Taking  that  idea  a  step  further,  a  user  in  Central  Park  could  provide  a 
location-based service with the information that he’s in New York City, but not that he’s in a specific park. 
Transparency.  Transparency  is  also  essential,  since  users  should  know  which  entities  are  managing 
their data and how and when those entities are using it. Stakeholders such as service providers must be part 
of this equation,  which  might  make  take-it-or-leave-it license agreements  obsolete. Businesses  will adjust 
their services according to the amount of personal data the user provides. 

Data  management.  A  huge  issue  is  deciding  who  manages  the  secrets.  Technically,  cryptographic 
mechanisms and protocols protect data throughout the service’s life cycle, but some entities might lack the 
resources  to  manage  such  mechanisms.  In  other  words,  one  data  management  policy  will  not  fit  all 
situations.  Consequently,  there  must be policies on how to  manage  various  kinds of data as  well as  some 
policy-enforcement  mechanism.  Developing  such  data  management  policies  and  enforcing  them  is  not 
trivial. It requires interpreting, translating, and optimally reconciling a series of rules, each of which might 
be  in  a  different  language.  And  any  policies  must  align  with  legislation  on  data  protection,  which  itself 
could change. 

Identity management 

In  the  IoT,  identity  management  requires  considering  a  staggering  variety  of  identity  and  relationship 

types, according to certain object identity principles:  

  An  object’s  identity  is  not  the  same  as  the  identity  of  its  underlying  mechanisms.  The  x-ray 
machine in the radiology department might have an IP address, but it should also have its own 
identity to distinguish it from other machines.  

  An object can have one core identity and several temporary identities. A hospital can become a 

meeting place for a health conference or a shelter after a fire.  

  An object can identify itself using its identity or its specific features. A virtual food identifies 

itself by its ingredients and quantity. 

  Objects  know  the  identity  of  their  owners.  The  device  that  controls  a  user’s  glucose  level 

should know how that information fits in that user’s overall health.  

Objects  can  also  be  in  groups,  which  some  mechanism  must  manage.  A  house  could  have  several 
appliances  that  only  certain  residents  and  visitors  can  use  at  particular  times.  The  refrigerator  could  lock 
itself after midnight to any resident or visiting teenagers, but remain open for the adults. 

Proving identity is an important part of identity management. As developers create a worldwide network 
of  objects,  they  must  build  an  infrastructure  that  allows  mutual  object  authentication.  There  must  be  a 
balance between centralized management and a distributed, hierarchical approach.  

Mechanisms  for  anonymization  and  the  creation  of  pseudonyms  are  also  important  building  blocks. 
Because the IoT deals with multiple contexts, an entity is not likely to reveal its identity all the time. For 
example, in a vehicular network, a police car can reveal its identity to cars and staff at the police station, 
but keep its identity hidden during undercover work unless it is interacting with other police cars.  

As  these  examples  illustrate,  identify  management  in  the  IoT  offers  both  challenge  and  opportunity  to 
improve security’s practical use. A promising approach is diverse authentication methods for humans and 

machines.  A  user  could  open  an  office  door  using  bioidentification  (such  as  a  fingerprint)  or  an  object 
within  a  personal  network,  such  as  a  passport,  identity  card,  or  smartphone.  Combining  authentication 
methods can prevent any loss of overall system security. Such combinations typically take the form of what 
I am + what I know or what I have + what I know. 

Authorization  is  also  an  identity  management  concern.  Authentication  and  authorization  share  open 
research  issues,  such  as  finding  a  balance  between  centralized  and  distributed  systems  to  answer  the 
question of who’s in charge of defining and publishing roles. However, specific topics, such as delegation, 
fall mainly under the authorization umbrella. An IoT element can delegate certain tasks to other objects for 
a limited time. For example, an object in the user’s personal network, such as his phone, can check on his 
behalf to see if his suitcase contains all the clothes needed for an upcoming conference.  

Granularity is also an authorization issue. The services an object provides might depend on the number 
of  credentials  presented.  For  example,  a  classroom  could  provide  anyone  who  asks  with  the  name  of  the 
course  being  taught,  but  it  would  release  the  syllabus  of  that  course  only  to  students  with  authorization 
certificates from the dean. 

Trust and governance 

Trust is essential to implement the IoT. In this context, trust is more than the mechanisms that reduce the 
uncertainty of objects as they interact, although such mechanisms are important in helping objects choose 
an adequate partner for their needs. In the IoT, such mechanisms must be able to define trust in a dynamic, 
collaborative environment and understand what it means to provide trust throughout an interaction. 

But  trust  also  encompasses  how  users  feel  while  interacting  in  the  IoT.  Feelings  of  helplessness  and 
being  under  some  unknown  external  control  can  greatly  undermine  the  deployment  of  IoT-based 
applications and services. There must be support for controlling the state of the virtual world.  Users must 
be able to control their own services, and they must have tools that accurately describe all their interactions 
so that they can form an accurate mental map of their virtual surroundings. 

Governance  helps  strengthen  trust  in  the  IoT.  A  common  framework  for  security  policies  will  support 
interoperability  and  ensure  security’s  continuity.  Defining  adequate  enforcement  mechanisms  will  go  a 
long way toward simplifying data protection.  

A  governance  framework  can  also  help  reduce  liability.  If  someone  can  attribute  a  malicious  action 
transaction  to  a  particular  user  or  agent,  it  will  be  possible  to  punish  that  user  or  the  agent’s  owner.  But 
governance is a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it offers stability, support for political decisions, and 
a  fair  enforcement  mechanism.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily  become  excessive,  fostering  an 
environment in which people are continuously monitored and controlled. If the current Internet’s partially 
solved  governance  problem  is  any  indication,  it  will  take  the  combined  efforts  of  several  research 
communities  to  address  the  challenges  of  a  governance  framework  when  countless  stakeholders  and 
billions of objects are added to the mix. 

Fault tolerance 

Clearly, the IoT will be more susceptible to attack than the current Internet, since billions more devices 
will  be  producing  and  consuming  services.  Highly  constrained  devices  will  be  the  most  vulnerable,  and 
malicious entities will seek to control at least some devices either directly or indirectly. In this context, fault 
tolerance is indispensable to assure service reliability, but any solution must be specialized and lightweight 
to account for the number of constrained and easily accessible IoT devices. 

Achieving fault tolerance in the IoT will require three cooperative efforts. The first is to make all objects 
secure  by  default.  Aside  from  designing  secure  protocols  and  mechanisms,  researchers  must  work  on 
improving software implementation quality, since it  might  not be feasible to provide  a software patch for 
billions of devices.  

The second effort is to give all IoT objects the ability to know the state of the network and its services. 
This system would need to give feedback to many other elements; for example, a watchdog system could 
acquire  data  as  part  of  supplying  qualitative  and  quantitative  security  metrics.  An  important  task  in  this 
second effort is to build an accountability system that will help monitor state. 

Finally, objects should be able to defend themselves against network failures and attacks. All protocols 
should  incorporate  mechanisms  that  respond  to  abnormal  situations  and  allow  the  object  to  gracefully 
degrade  its  service.  Objects  should  be  able  to  use  intrusion-detection  systems  and  other  defensive 
mechanisms to ward off attackers.  

Once  an  attack  affects  their  services,  IoT  elements  should  be  able  to  act  quickly  to  recover  from  any 
damage.  Such elements can  use  feedback  from other  mechanisms and IoT entities  to  map the  location of 
unsafe  zones,  where  an  attack  has  caused  service  outages,  and  trusted  zones—areas  with  no  service 
outages.  Such  information  can  be  the  basis  for  implementing  various  recovery  services,  such  as  having 
objects access trusted zone services first. Mechanisms could also inform human operators of any damaged 
zone and then perform maintenance operations. This infrastructure self-management is a key IoT tenet. 

WORK IN PROGRESS 

Researchers,  governments,  and  industries  are  committed  to  developing  and  standardizing  identity  and 
security mechanisms for IoT building blocks. Table 1 lists some of the more mature efforts. The table does 
not  consider  work-in-progress  standards  and  government  recommendations  such  as  EU  recommendation 
C(2009) 3200.  

Although these standards and mechanisms are good first steps, much additional work is required to build 
a robust and secure IoT. Again, the holistic view is important. It is important to protect the IoT’s building 
blocks, but its features create new requirements that are equally important. The design of specific security 
IoT  mechanisms  is  still  in  its  infancy,  but  recent  developments  are  encouraging  and  could  provide  some 
degree of protection to existing IoT applications, such as the different instances of the IBM Smarter Planet 
initiative 
(www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/?ca=v_smarterplanet)  or  ventures  such  as  Pachube 
(https://pachube.com) and Arrayent (http://arrayent.com).

Cryptography and protocols 

Researchers  are  already  making  strides  toward  developing  better  cryptographic  algorithms  and  modes 
for  IoT  devices.  The  ISO/IEC  29192  standards  aim  to  provide  lightweight  cryptography  for  constrained 
devices,  including  block  and  stream  ciphers  and  asymmetric  mechanisms.  As  of  August  2011,  these 
standards  were  still  under  development,  but  some  algorithms  are  available.  Sony’s  CLEFIA  is  a  novel 
block  cipher  that  supports  128-bit  keys  (www.sony.net/Products/cryptography/clefia/about/index.html). 
The  eSTREAM  project  (www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream)  studied  the  robustness  of  stream  ciphers  such  as 
Salsa20/12 and Trivium, which are extremely useful in embedded systems. 

Research  on  lightweight  dedicated  hash  functions  has  just  started.  The  winner  of  the  SHA-3 
competition—scheduled to finish in late 2012—should lay the foundation for more work on a new class of 
hash  functions  for  long-term  security.  The  competition’s  goal  is  to  develop  a  new  cryptographic  hash 
algorithm  that  converts  a  variable  length  message  into  a  short  message  digest.  The  digest  will  be  part  of 
generating  digital  signatures,  message  authentication  codes,  and  many  other  security  applications  in  the 

information infrastructure (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/index.html). 

It is already possible to construct lightweight hash functions based on lightweight block ciphers.  As an 
alternative  to  these  lightweight  algorithms,  existing  optimizations  in  operational  modes  can  make  data 
processing more efficient. Both AES-CCM and AES-GCM offer data integrity and confidentiality. Another 
optimization  is  algorithm  management  in  a  cross-layer  architecture,  where  various  security  mechanisms 
share one algorithm.[3] 

Other communities, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, aim to implement Internet standards in 

the IoT. Table 2 lists these standards and their purpose.

Although researchers have met some interim implementation goals, various constraints make it difficult 
to fully achieve security through Internet standards.[2] Developers can tweak the IPsec protocol to provide 
network-layer security between Internet hosts and constrained  devices,[4] but the remaining challenges are 
formidable.  It  will  be  daunting  to  deal  with  the  coexistence  of  strong  link-layer  security  and  IPsec,  for 
example, or the negotiation of keying material. Preshared keys are usable with previously known devices, 
and  public-key  cryptography  is  useful  when  the  constrained  object  behaves  as  a  client,[4]  but  the 
negotiation of dynamic keys between previously unknown entities is still an open problem. 

Identity and ownership  

In certain IoT contexts, single-sign-on (SSO) mechanisms can be useful, since users need to authenticate 
only  once  to  interact  with  various  devices.  However,  traditional  Web  2.0  SSO  such  as  OpenID  and 
Shibboleth were not designed to fulfill certain IoT requirements,[6] such as giving the user control over the 
choice  of  identity  provider.  Other  mechanisms  force  users  to  employ  a  particular  protocol,  which  can  be 
problematic in a heterogeneous environment. Another issue is the lack of support for directional identities, 
in which objects broadcast their identities.  

These issues strongly imply the need to  adapt existing SSO mechanisms or create new ones that better 
fit the IoT. Although some approaches address this need, proposing a hybrid architecture that combines all 
mechanisms through specially crafted middleware,[6] this topic still needs research.  

One approach to verifying device ownership and owner identity is digital shadowing,[7] in which a user 
projects his virtual identity onto logical nodes. Digital shadows are based on the notion that a user’s objects 
act  on  his  behalf  but  do  not  store  his  identity,  only  a  virtual  identity  that  contains  information  about  his 
attributes and the objects’ sessions and interactions  with the architecture. Therefore,  digital shadows only 
implicitly indicate their owner’s identity.  

Figure  1  illustrates  how  digital  shadowing  might  work  with  an  electronic  stethoscope  and  white  coat. 
The  doctor’s  fingerprints  prompt  a  query  to  the  government  database,  while  his  coat  provides  the  digital 
shadow to the hospital database, which checks the doctor’s role. Both authentication aspects (what I am + 
what  I  have)  enable  the  doctor  to  enter  a  certain  hospital  area.  The  stethoscope  records  and  stores  the 
patient’s heartbeats, signs the data on the doctor’s behalf, and stores the data in the hospital database. The 
stethoscope  can  also  check  for  any  heartbeat  anomalies  by  accessing  other  systems  inside  or  outside  the 
hospital.

store his virtual identity and act on his behalf. (Top) The coat and the doctor’s fingerprints are elements of 
an authentication  method.  (Bottom)  As the doctor uses the stethoscope, it not only  records and  stores the 
patient’s heartbeats, but also signs the data on the doctor’s behalf and stores it in the hospital database.  

 

The  coat  and  fingerprint  authentication  scenario  in  Figure  1  might  also  benefit  from  revocable  access 
delegation,[8]  in  which  an  RFID  tag  (the  logical  node)  returns  a  valid  ID  (the  virtual  identity)  only  if  the 
tag’s owner has authorized the reader. These tags are essentially part of the user’s digital shadow because 
they provide no user information (only a number), but any reader with explicit user authorization will know 
that they belong to that user. Because the tags’ ID is not easy to link to its owner and the user can revoke 
authorization at any time, the digital shadow approach also accounts for privacy. 

Privacy protection  

Various approaches are in development to protect the personal information of IoT users. The delegation 
mechanism is one privacy preservation proposal. An unauthorized RFID reader will retrieve only a random 
value, so it will not be able to track the user.  

However, limiting access to the user is not the only protection scenario. In some cases, users will want 
to provide information without revealing too much about themselves. Some solutions in this context let the 
user find others who best match  his preferences, without actually revealing such preferences to everyone. 
Other  schemes  let  users  maintain  their  location  privacy  even  when  making  location-dependent  queries.[9] 
Thus, a user can try to locate someone in the vicinity who likes Beethoven, without explicitly providing his 
own location and music preferences.  

An interesting idea is the privacy coach,[10] in which an RFID reader in a mobile phone scans the tags 
embedded  in  some  object,  such  as  a  loyalty  card,  and  downloads  the  companion  privacy  policy.  If  the 
object’s  privacy  policy  does  not  match  the  user’s  preferences,  the  user  can  choose  not  to  use  the  object. 
Conversely,  whenever  an  RFID  reader  tries  to  read  the  mobile  phone’s  signal,  the  phone  can  check  the 
reader’s privacy policy  and ask  for user consent. Finally, the privacy coach can protect the  user’s private 
physical space, such as a house, by scanning for malicious items or undesirable entities, such as objects left 
to monitor the house without the user’s permission.[11] 

The IoT is already more than a concept. By complying with security requirements, it can fully bloom into 
a  paradigm  that  will  improve  many  aspects  of  daily  life.  Open  problems  remain  in  many  areas,  such  as 
cryptographic  mechanisms,  network  protocols,  data  and  identity  management,  user  privacy,  self-
management,  and  trusted  architectures.  Future  research  must  also  carefully  consider  the  balance  of 
governance  and  legal  frameworks  with  innovation.  Governance  can  sometimes  hinder  innovation,  but 
innovation  in  turn  can  inadvertently  ignore  human  rights.  The  right  balance  will  ensure  stable  progress 
toward  realizing  and  securing  the  IoT  as  envisioned,  and  the  benefits  to  humanity  will  be  well  worth  the 
effort.

Securing the Internet of Things

In  the  Internet  of  Things  vision,  every  physical  object  has  a  virtual 
component  that  can  produce  and  consume  services.  Such  extreme 

interconnection will bring unprecedented convenience and economy, but it 

will also require novel approaches to ensure its safe and ethical use. 

In the Internet of Things (IoT), everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and thing 
has  a  locatable,  addressable,  and  readable  counterpart  on  the  Internet.  These  virtual  entities  can  produce 
and consume services and collaborate toward a common goal.  The user’s phone knows about his physical 
and  mental  state  through  a  network  of  devices  that  surround  his  body,  so  it  can  act  on  his  behalf.  The 
embedded  system  in  a  swimming  pool  can  share  its  state  with  other  virtual  entities.  With  these 
characteristics, the IoT promises to extend “anywhere, anyhow, anytime” computing to “anything, anyone, 
any service.” 

Several significant obstacles remain to fulfill the IoT vision, among them security. The Internet and its 
users  are  already  under  continual  attack,  and  a  growing  economy—replete  with  business  models  that 
undermine  the  Internet’s  ethical  use—is  fully  focused  on  exploiting  the  current  version’s  foundational 
weaknesses.  This  does  not  bode  well  for  the  IoT,  which  incorporates  many  constrained  devices.  Indeed, 
realizing the IoT vision is likely to spark novel and ingenious malicious models. The challenge is to prevent 
the growth of such models or at least to mitigate and limit their impact. 

Meeting  this  challenge  requires  understanding  the  characteristics  of  things  and  the  technologies  that 
empower the IoT. Mobile applications are already intensifying users’ interaction with the environment, and 
researchers have made considerable progress in developing sensory devices to provide myriad dimensions 
of information to enrich the user experience.  

However, without strong security foundations, attacks and malfunctions in the IoT will outweigh any of 
its  benefits.  Traditional  protection  mechanisms—lightweight  cryptography,  secure  protocols,  and  privacy 
assurance—are  not  enough.  Rather,  researchers  must  discover  the  full  extent  of  specific  obstacles.  They 
must  analyze  current  security  protocols  and  mechanisms  and  decide  if  such  approaches  are  worth 
integrating into the IoT as is or if adaptations or entirely new designs will better accomplish security goals.  
The  proper  legal  and  technical  framework  is  essential.  To  establish  it,  analysts  must  thoroughly 
understand the risks associated with various IoT scenarios, such as air travel, which has many interrelated 
elements,  including  safety,  privacy,  and  economy[1].  Only  then  is  it  possible  to  justify  the  cost  of 
developing security and privacy mechanisms. 

All  these  requirements  underline  some  critical  first  steps  in  implementing  IoT  security  measures 
successfully: understand the IoT conceptually, evaluate Internet security’s current state, and explore how to 
move  from  solutions  that  meet current requirements and constraints  to those that can reasonably assure a 
secure IoT. 

INFRASTRUCTURE SEEDS 

The “Objects in a Superconnected World” sidebar describes some of the characteristics of the things in 
the envisioned IoT and some existing applications that are arguably partial IoT instances. The path to the 
IoT is not necessary a single step. In fact, it makes far more sense to gradually incorporate IoT applications 
into  the  real  world  by  giving  objects  virtual  personas  and  thinking  outside  the  box.  For  example, 
researchers  could  enhance  fishing  vessels  with  sensors  and  communication  systems  that  offer  shared 

R.Roman,P.Najera,andJ.Lopez,“SecuringtheInternetofThings”,IEEEComputer,vol.44,pp.51-58,2011.http://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2011.291NICSLab.Publications:https://www.nics.uma.es/publicationsservices  about  the  state  of  the  sea  and  other  facets.  Objects  that  belong  to  a  virtual  world  can  be  made 
aware of objects outside that world—including the services that other objects and entities provide. Sensors 
that  monitor  agricultural  fields  can  access  weather  reports  for  the  area  and  adapt  the  irrigation  systems 
accordingly.  Developers  can  also  decrease  system  dependence  on  a  centralized  architecture,  creating 
autonomous applications.  Mobile phones  without Internet  connection in a disaster area  can collaborate to 
propagate the location of a sensor-enabled water source.  

This staggered approach might help  society enjoy  IoT’s benefits as analysts and researchers tackle the 
complexities in its underlying infrastructure. The problems will be both technical and semantic, requiring 
interoperable mechanisms that can both connect entities and help them understand each other. Distributed 
services must be reliable, not only offering availability but also adapting themselves in case of malfunction. 
A governance model must scale to billions of devices all over the world. Within these meta challenges are 
issues such as bootstrapping, mobility, scalability, data processing, standardization, and billing.  

COPING WITH OLD AND NEW THREATS 

Not surprisingly, even a staggered approach to developing the IoT presents a daunting task for security. 
What protection measures are possible as billions of intelligent things cooperate with other real and virtual 
entities  in  random  and  unpredictable  ways?  The  IoT’s  highly  distributed  nature  and  use  of  fragile 
technologies, such as limited-function embedded devices in public areas, create weak links that  malicious 
entities  can  exploit.  Easily  accessible  objects  in  unprotected  zones,  such  as  city  streets,  are  vulnerable  to 
physical  harm.  Like  compromising  botnets,  some  objects  would  try  to  hinder  services  from  the  inside. 
Additional threats include the existence of a domino effect between intertwined services and user profiling 
through data collection and other methods. 

To avoid these threats, the IoT must have strong security foundations built on a holistic view of security 
for all IoT elements at all  stages—from the identification  of objects to the provisioning of services,  from 
the  acquisition  of  data  to  the  governance  of  the  whole  infrastructure.  All  security  mechanisms  must 
consider each object’s lifecycle and services from the very beginning of that object’s existence.  

Protocol and network security 

Heterogeneity  greatly  affects  the  protection  of  the  network  infrastructure.  Highly  constrained  devices 
that use low-bandwidth standards, such as IEEE 802.15.4, must open a secure communication channel with 
more  powerful  devices—for  example,  sensor  nodes  scattered  in  a  smart  city  communicate  with 
smartphones  or  PDAs.  Securing  this  channel  requires  optimal  cryptography  algorithms  and  adequate  key 
management  systems,  as  well  as  security  protocols  that  connect  all  these  devices  through  the  Internet. 
Although  it  is  not  clear  how  many  resources  will  be  available  to  such  constrained  devices  once  the  IoT 
truly  takes  off,  it  is  safe  to  optimize  security  as  much  as  possible  to  improve  the  provision  of  future 
services. 

In  a  bottom-up  approach,  cryptography  is  the  cornerstone  for  network  infrastructure  protection. 
Although it is possible to implement existing  standards,  such as  AES,  some IoT devices, such as passive 
RFID tags, might be extremely constrained. Cryptographic mechanisms must be smaller and faster but with 
little  or  no  reduction  in  security  level.  Mechanisms  could  include  symmetric  algorithms,  hash  functions, 
and random number generators.  

In this approach, cryptography is the bricks and the  mortar is the  key-management infrastructures that 
establish  keying  material,  for  example,  shared  secret  keys.  Making  this  mortar  requires  associating 
previously  unrelated  and  sometimes  highly  constrained  objects  in  an  extremely  dynamic  environment. 
Manual  configuration  works  only  in  small  and  personal  environments,  and  traditional  public-key 
infrastructures will almost certainly not scale to accommodate the IoT’s amalgam of contexts and devices. 
There is also the issue of rekeying devices to keep information flow safe in the long run. 

Further  up  the  network  infrastructure  are  the  communication  layers.  Clearly,  the  IoT  must  extensively 
use  Internet  standards  for  communication  and  service  provision.  Still,  some  devices,  such  as  sensors  that 
check the state of runway lights, will lack the resources to implement the Internet security mechanisms that 
normally  protect  these  kinds  of  interactions.  Therefore,  security  protocols  require  some  forward-looking 
adaptation. Subtle differences between IoT and Internet protocols might lead to gaps in end-to-end security. 
Adaptations  should  not  only  fulfill  the  IoT’s  performance  requirements  but  also  provide  the  protocol’s 

original security properties in the context of the Internet architecture.[2] 

Data and privacy 

Privacy is one of  the  most sensitive  subjects in any discussion of IoT protection. The data availability 
explosion has created Big Brother-like entities that profile and track users without their consent. The IoT’s 
anywhere,  anything,  anytime  nature  could  easily  turn  such  practices  into  a  dystopia.  Users  would  have 
access to an unprecedented number of personalized services, all of which would generate considerable data, 
and the environment itself would be able to acquire information about users automatically.  

Although a dystopia is the worst-case scenario, the IoT could certainly exacerbate a range of undesirable 
situations.  Facebook  accounts  already  affect  a  user’s  employability  and  personal  interactions.  Imagine 
exponentially more such exposure opportunities.   

Privacy by design. One viable solution is privacy by design, in which users would have the tools they 
need to manage their own data. The solution is not too far from current reality. Whenever users produce a 
data fragment, they can already use dynamic consent tools that permit certain services to access as little or 
as  much  of  that  data  as  desired.  Taking  that  idea  a  step  further,  a  user  in  Central  Park  could  provide  a 
location-based service with the information that he’s in New York City, but not that he’s in a specific park. 
Transparency.  Transparency  is  also  essential,  since  users  should  know  which  entities  are  managing 
their data and how and when those entities are using it. Stakeholders such as service providers must be part 
of this equation,  which  might  make  take-it-or-leave-it license agreements  obsolete. Businesses  will adjust 
their services according to the amount of personal data the user provides. 

Data  management.  A  huge  issue  is  deciding  who  manages  the  secrets.  Technically,  cryptographic 
mechanisms and protocols protect data throughout the service’s life cycle, but some entities might lack the 
resources  to  manage  such  mechanisms.  In  other  words,  one  data  management  policy  will  not  fit  all 
situations.  Consequently,  there  must be policies on how to  manage  various  kinds of data as  well as  some 
policy-enforcement  mechanism.  Developing  such  data  management  policies  and  enforcing  them  is  not 
trivial. It requires interpreting, translating, and optimally reconciling a series of rules, each of which might 
be  in  a  different  language.  And  any  policies  must  align  with  legislation  on  data  protection,  which  itself 
could change. 

Identity management 

In  the  IoT,  identity  management  requires  considering  a  staggering  variety  of  identity  and  relationship 

types, according to certain object identity principles:  

  An  object’s  identity  is  not  the  same  as  the  identity  of  its  underlying  mechanisms.  The  x-ray 
machine in the radiology department might have an IP address, but it should also have its own 
identity to distinguish it from other machines.  

  An object can have one core identity and several temporary identities. A hospital can become a 

meeting place for a health conference or a shelter after a fire.  

  An object can identify itself using its identity or its specific features. A virtual food identifies 

itself by its ingredients and quantity. 

  Objects  know  the  identity  of  their  owners.  The  device  that  controls  a  user’s  glucose  level 

should know how that information fits in that user’s overall health.  

Objects  can  also  be  in  groups,  which  some  mechanism  must  manage.  A  house  could  have  several 
appliances  that  only  certain  residents  and  visitors  can  use  at  particular  times.  The  refrigerator  could  lock 
itself after midnight to any resident or visiting teenagers, but remain open for the adults. 

Proving identity is an important part of identity management. As developers create a worldwide network 
of  objects,  they  must  build  an  infrastructure  that  allows  mutual  object  authentication.  There  must  be  a 
balance between centralized management and a distributed, hierarchical approach.  

Mechanisms  for  anonymization  and  the  creation  of  pseudonyms  are  also  important  building  blocks. 
Because the IoT deals with multiple contexts, an entity is not likely to reveal its identity all the time. For 
example, in a vehicular network, a police car can reveal its identity to cars and staff at the police station, 
but keep its identity hidden during undercover work unless it is interacting with other police cars.  

As  these  examples  illustrate,  identify  management  in  the  IoT  offers  both  challenge  and  opportunity  to 
improve security’s practical use. A promising approach is diverse authentication methods for humans and 

machines.  A  user  could  open  an  office  door  using  bioidentification  (such  as  a  fingerprint)  or  an  object 
within  a  personal  network,  such  as  a  passport,  identity  card,  or  smartphone.  Combining  authentication 
methods can prevent any loss of overall system security. Such combinations typically take the form of what 
I am + what I know or what I have + what I know. 

Authorization  is  also  an  identity  management  concern.  Authentication  and  authorization  share  open 
research  issues,  such  as  finding  a  balance  between  centralized  and  distributed  systems  to  answer  the 
question of who’s in charge of defining and publishing roles. However, specific topics, such as delegation, 
fall mainly under the authorization umbrella. An IoT element can delegate certain tasks to other objects for 
a limited time. For example, an object in the user’s personal network, such as his phone, can check on his 
behalf to see if his suitcase contains all the clothes needed for an upcoming conference.  

Granularity is also an authorization issue. The services an object provides might depend on the number 
of  credentials  presented.  For  example,  a  classroom  could  provide  anyone  who  asks  with  the  name  of  the 
course  being  taught,  but  it  would  release  the  syllabus  of  that  course  only  to  students  with  authorization 
certificates from the dean. 

Trust and governance 

Trust is essential to implement the IoT. In this context, trust is more than the mechanisms that reduce the 
uncertainty of objects as they interact, although such mechanisms are important in helping objects choose 
an adequate partner for their needs. In the IoT, such mechanisms must be able to define trust in a dynamic, 
collaborative environment and understand what it means to provide trust throughout an interaction. 

But  trust  also  encompasses  how  users  feel  while  interacting  in  the  IoT.  Feelings  of  helplessness  and 
being  under  some  unknown  external  control  can  greatly  undermine  the  deployment  of  IoT-based 
applications and services. There must be support for controlling the state of the virtual world.  Users must 
be able to control their own services, and they must have tools that accurately describe all their interactions 
so that they can form an accurate mental map of their virtual surroundings. 

Governance  helps  strengthen  trust  in  the  IoT.  A  common  framework  for  security  policies  will  support 
interoperability  and  ensure  security’s  continuity.  Defining  adequate  enforcement  mechanisms  will  go  a 
long way toward simplifying data protection.  

A  governance  framework  can  also  help  reduce  liability.  If  someone  can  attribute  a  malicious  action 
transaction  to  a  particular  user  or  agent,  it  will  be  possible  to  punish  that  user  or  the  agent’s  owner.  But 
governance is a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it offers stability, support for political decisions, and 
a  fair  enforcement  mechanism.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily  become  excessive,  fostering  an 
environment in which people are continuously monitored and controlled. If the current Internet’s partially 
solved  governance  problem  is  any  indication,  it  will  take  the  combined  efforts  of  several  research 
communities  to  address  the  challenges  of  a  governance  framework  when  countless  stakeholders  and 
billions of objects are added to the mix. 

Fault tolerance 

Clearly, the IoT will be more susceptible to attack than the current Internet, since billions more devices 
will  be  producing  and  consuming  services.  Highly  constrained  devices  will  be  the  most  vulnerable,  and 
malicious entities will seek to control at least some devices either directly or indirectly. In this context, fault 
tolerance is indispensable to assure service reliability, but any solution must be specialized and lightweight 
to account for the number of constrained and easily accessible IoT devices. 

Achieving fault tolerance in the IoT will require three cooperative efforts. The first is to make all objects 
secure  by  default.  Aside  from  designing  secure  protocols  and  mechanisms,  researchers  must  work  on 
improving software implementation quality, since it  might  not be feasible to provide  a software patch for 
billions of devices.  

The second effort is to give all IoT objects the ability to know the state of the network and its services. 
This system would need to give feedback to many other elements; for example, a watchdog system could 
acquire  data  as  part  of  supplying  qualitative  and  quantitative  security  metrics.  An  important  task  in  this 
second effort is to build an accountability system that will help monitor state. 

Finally, objects should be able to defend themselves against network failures and attacks. All protocols 
should  incorporate  mechanisms  that  respond  to  abnormal  situations  and  allow  the  object  to  gracefully 
degrade  its  service.  Objects  should  be  able  to  use  intrusion-detection  systems  and  other  defensive 
mechanisms to ward off attackers.  

Once  an  attack  affects  their  services,  IoT  elements  should  be  able  to  act  quickly  to  recover  from  any 
damage.  Such elements can  use  feedback  from other  mechanisms and IoT entities  to  map the  location of 
unsafe  zones,  where  an  attack  has  caused  service  outages,  and  trusted  zones—areas  with  no  service 
outages.  Such  information  can  be  the  basis  for  implementing  various  recovery  services,  such  as  having 
objects access trusted zone services first. Mechanisms could also inform human operators of any damaged 
zone and then perform maintenance operations. This infrastructure self-management is a key IoT tenet. 

WORK IN PROGRESS 

Researchers,  governments,  and  industries  are  committed  to  developing  and  standardizing  identity  and 
security mechanisms for IoT building blocks. Table 1 lists some of the more mature efforts. The table does 
not  consider  work-in-progress  standards  and  government  recommendations  such  as  EU  recommendation 
C(2009) 3200.  

Although these standards and mechanisms are good first steps, much additional work is required to build 
a robust and secure IoT. Again, the holistic view is important. It is important to protect the IoT’s building 
blocks, but its features create new requirements that are equally important. The design of specific security 
IoT  mechanisms  is  still  in  its  infancy,  but  recent  developments  are  encouraging  and  could  provide  some 
degree of protection to existing IoT applications, such as the different instances of the IBM Smarter Planet 
initiative 
(www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/?ca=v_smarterplanet)  or  ventures  such  as  Pachube 
(https://pachube.com) and Arrayent (http://arrayent.com).

Cryptography and protocols 

Researchers  are  already  making  strides  toward  developing  better  cryptographic  algorithms  and  modes 
for  IoT  devices.  The  ISO/IEC  29192  standards  aim  to  provide  lightweight  cryptography  for  constrained 
devices,  including  block  and  stream  ciphers  and  asymmetric  mechanisms.  As  of  August  2011,  these 
standards  were  still  under  development,  but  some  algorithms  are  available.  Sony’s  CLEFIA  is  a  novel 
block  cipher  that  supports  128-bit  keys  (www.sony.net/Products/cryptography/clefia/about/index.html). 
The  eSTREAM  project  (www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream)  studied  the  robustness  of  stream  ciphers  such  as 
Salsa20/12 and Trivium, which are extremely useful in embedded systems. 

Research  on  lightweight  dedicated  hash  functions  has  just  started.  The  winner  of  the  SHA-3 
competition—scheduled to finish in late 2012—should lay the foundation for more work on a new class of 
hash  functions  for  long-term  security.  The  competition’s  goal  is  to  develop  a  new  cryptographic  hash 
algorithm  that  converts  a  variable  length  message  into  a  short  message  digest.  The  digest  will  be  part  of 
generating  digital  signatures,  message  authentication  codes,  and  many  other  security  applications  in  the 

information infrastructure (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/index.html). 

It is already possible to construct lightweight hash functions based on lightweight block ciphers.  As an 
alternative  to  these  lightweight  algorithms,  existing  optimizations  in  operational  modes  can  make  data 
processing more efficient. Both AES-CCM and AES-GCM offer data integrity and confidentiality. Another 
optimization  is  algorithm  management  in  a  cross-layer  architecture,  where  various  security  mechanisms 
share one algorithm.[3] 

Other communities, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, aim to implement Internet standards in 

the IoT. Table 2 lists these standards and their purpose.

Although researchers have met some interim implementation goals, various constraints make it difficult 
to fully achieve security through Internet standards.[2] Developers can tweak the IPsec protocol to provide 
network-layer security between Internet hosts and constrained  devices,[4] but the remaining challenges are 
formidable.  It  will  be  daunting  to  deal  with  the  coexistence  of  strong  link-layer  security  and  IPsec,  for 
example, or the negotiation of keying material. Preshared keys are usable with previously known devices, 
and  public-key  cryptography  is  useful  when  the  constrained  object  behaves  as  a  client,[4]  but  the 
negotiation of dynamic keys between previously unknown entities is still an open problem. 

Identity and ownership  

In certain IoT contexts, single-sign-on (SSO) mechanisms can be useful, since users need to authenticate 
only  once  to  interact  with  various  devices.  However,  traditional  Web  2.0  SSO  such  as  OpenID  and 
Shibboleth were not designed to fulfill certain IoT requirements,[6] such as giving the user control over the 
choice  of  identity  provider.  Other  mechanisms  force  users  to  employ  a  particular  protocol,  which  can  be 
problematic in a heterogeneous environment. Another issue is the lack of support for directional identities, 
in which objects broadcast their identities.  

These issues strongly imply the need to  adapt existing SSO mechanisms or create new ones that better 
fit the IoT. Although some approaches address this need, proposing a hybrid architecture that combines all 
mechanisms through specially crafted middleware,[6] this topic still needs research.  

One approach to verifying device ownership and owner identity is digital shadowing,[7] in which a user 
projects his virtual identity onto logical nodes. Digital shadows are based on the notion that a user’s objects 
act  on  his  behalf  but  do  not  store  his  identity,  only  a  virtual  identity  that  contains  information  about  his 
attributes and the objects’ sessions and interactions  with the architecture. Therefore,  digital shadows only 
implicitly indicate their owner’s identity.  

Figure  1  illustrates  how  digital  shadowing  might  work  with  an  electronic  stethoscope  and  white  coat. 
The  doctor’s  fingerprints  prompt  a  query  to  the  government  database,  while  his  coat  provides  the  digital 
shadow to the hospital database, which checks the doctor’s role. Both authentication aspects (what I am + 
what  I  have)  enable  the  doctor  to  enter  a  certain  hospital  area.  The  stethoscope  records  and  stores  the 
patient’s heartbeats, signs the data on the doctor’s behalf, and stores the data in the hospital database. The 
stethoscope  can  also  check  for  any  heartbeat  anomalies  by  accessing  other  systems  inside  or  outside  the 
hospital. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure  1.  Instances  of  digital  shadowing  for  a  doctor. The doctor’s  white  coat  and  electronic  stethoscope 
store his virtual identity and act on his behalf. (Top) The coat and the doctor’s fingerprints are elements of 
an authentication  method.  (Bottom)  As the doctor uses the stethoscope, it not only  records and  stores the 
patient’s heartbeats, but also signs the data on the doctor’s behalf and stores it in the hospital database.  

 

The  coat  and  fingerprint  authentication  scenario  in  Figure  1  might  also  benefit  from  revocable  access 
delegation,[8]  in  which  an  RFID  tag  (the  logical  node)  returns  a  valid  ID  (the  virtual  identity)  only  if  the 
tag’s owner has authorized the reader. These tags are essentially part of the user’s digital shadow because 
they provide no user information (only a number), but any reader with explicit user authorization will know 
that they belong to that user. Because the tags’ ID is not easy to link to its owner and the user can revoke 
authorization at any time, the digital shadow approach also accounts for privacy. 

Privacy protection  

Various approaches are in development to protect the personal information of IoT users. The delegation 
mechanism is one privacy preservation proposal. An unauthorized RFID reader will retrieve only a random 
value, so it will not be able to track the user.  

However, limiting access to the user is not the only protection scenario. In some cases, users will want 
to provide information without revealing too much about themselves. Some solutions in this context let the 
user find others who best match  his preferences, without actually revealing such preferences to everyone. 
Other  schemes  let  users  maintain  their  location  privacy  even  when  making  location-dependent  queries.[9] 
Thus, a user can try to locate someone in the vicinity who likes Beethoven, without explicitly providing his 
own location and music preferences.  

An interesting idea is the privacy coach,[10] in which an RFID reader in a mobile phone scans the tags 
embedded  in  some  object,  such  as  a  loyalty  card,  and  downloads  the  companion  privacy  policy.  If  the 
object’s  privacy  policy  does  not  match  the  user’s  preferences,  the  user  can  choose  not  to  use  the  object. 
Conversely,  whenever  an  RFID  reader  tries  to  read  the  mobile  phone’s  signal,  the  phone  can  check  the 
reader’s privacy policy  and ask  for user consent. Finally, the privacy coach can protect the  user’s private 
physical space, such as a house, by scanning for malicious items or undesirable entities, such as objects left 
to monitor the house without the user’s permission.[11] 

The IoT is already more than a concept. By complying with security requirements, it can fully bloom into 
a  paradigm  that  will  improve  many  aspects  of  daily  life.  Open  problems  remain  in  many  areas,  such  as 
cryptographic  mechanisms,  network  protocols,  data  and  identity  management,  user  privacy,  self-
management,  and  trusted  architectures.  Future  research  must  also  carefully  consider  the  balance  of 
governance  and  legal  frameworks  with  innovation.  Governance  can  sometimes  hinder  innovation,  but 
innovation  in  turn  can  inadvertently  ignore  human  rights.  The  right  balance  will  ensure  stable  progress 
toward  realizing  and  securing  the  IoT  as  envisioned,  and  the  benefits  to  humanity  will  be  well  worth  the 
effort.

SIDEBAR 

Objects in a Superconnected World 

Since  the  IoT’s  inception,  governments  and  other  organizations  have  tried  to  capture  its  essence  in 
words,  some  doing  so  more  successfully  than  others.[A]  In  a  nutshell,  the  IoT  is  a  worldwide  network  of 
interconnected objects. Each object that surrounds a person, from books to cars to appliances and food, has 
a virtual avatar that behaves as an active entity. In this context, all IoT objects have five main characteristics: 

 
Existence.  Things,  such  as  a  car,  exist  in  the  physical  world,  but  specific  technologies,  such  as  an 

embedded communication device, enable the existence of the thing’s virtual personas.  

Sense of self. All things have, either implicitly or explicitly, an identity that describes them, such as car, 
Porsche,  or  license  plate  number.  Objects  can  process  information,  make  decisions,  and  behave 
autonomously. 

Connectivity.  Things  can  open  communication  with  other  entities.  As  a  result,  both  an  element  in  their 

surroundings and a remote entity can locate and access them.  

Interactivity.  Things  can  interoperate  and  collaborate  with  a  wide  range  of  heterogeneous  entities, 

whether human,  machine, real, or virtual, producing and consuming a wide range of services. 

Dynamicity. Things can interact with other things at any time, any place, and in any way. They can enter 
and  leave  the  network  at  will,  need  not  be  limited  to  a  single  physical  location,  and  can  use  a  variety  of 
interfaces. 

 
An  optional  sixth  characteristic  is  environmental  awareness.  Sensors  might  enable  a  thing  to  perceive 
physical  and  virtual  data  about  its  environment,  such  as  water  radiation  or  network  overhead.  This 
characteristic  is  optional  because  not  all  things  will  exhibit  it,  such  as  an  object  enhanced  with  a 
radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag.  

The  combination  of  various  technologies  has  enabled  objects  to  exhibit  these  characteristics,  allowing 
them  to  become  virtual  beings.  Energy-efficient  microcontrollers  act  as  brains,  imbuing  objects  with 
embedded  intelligence.  Sensor  technology  provides  objects  with  sensory  receptors,  and  RFID  provides  a 
way  for  them  to  distinguish  one  another,  much  like  people  recognize  a  face.  Finally,  low-energy  wireless 
technology, such as IEEE 802.15.4, supplies the virtual counterparts of voice and hearing.  

Multiple  applications  already  use 

technologies,  such  as  machine-to-machine 
communication,  virtual  worlds,  and  robotics.  To  be  a  virtual  being,  an  IoT  object  doesn’t  need  all  these 
technologies. What it does need depends on the object and its mission. A tire can simply provide information 
about itself and its state, but a car will be much more technologically complex because it must be aware of 
its surroundings as well as its own state.  

these  and  other 

RFID in pharmaceutical environments, location-aware mobile applications, and smart metering systems 
are  all  essentially  “intranets  of  things,”  in  which  objects  are  isolated  from  those  in  other  scenarios  and 
domains. IoT applications will have greater scope and flexibility, being able to interact not only with objects 

 

 

Securing the Internet of Things

In  the  Internet  of  Things  vision,  every  physical  object  has  a  virtual 
component  that  can  produce  and  consume  services.  Such  extreme 

interconnection will bring unprecedented convenience and economy, but it 

will also require novel approaches to ensure its safe and ethical use. 

In the Internet of Things (IoT), everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and thing 
has  a  locatable,  addressable,  and  readable  counterpart  on  the  Internet.  These  virtual  entities  can  produce 
and consume services and collaborate toward a common goal.  The user’s phone knows about his physical 
and  mental  state  through  a  network  of  devices  that  surround  his  body,  so  it  can  act  on  his  behalf.  The 
embedded  system  in  a  swimming  pool  can  share  its  state  with  other  virtual  entities.  With  these 
characteristics, the IoT promises to extend “anywhere, anyhow, anytime” computing to “anything, anyone, 
any service.” 

Several significant obstacles remain to fulfill the IoT vision, among them security. The Internet and its 
users  are  already  under  continual  attack,  and  a  growing  economy—replete  with  business  models  that 
undermine  the  Internet’s  ethical  use—is  fully  focused  on  exploiting  the  current  version’s  foundational 
weaknesses.  This  does  not  bode  well  for  the  IoT,  which  incorporates  many  constrained  devices.  Indeed, 
realizing the IoT vision is likely to spark novel and ingenious malicious models. The challenge is to prevent 
the growth of such models or at least to mitigate and limit their impact. 

Meeting  this  challenge  requires  understanding  the  characteristics  of  things  and  the  technologies  that 
empower the IoT. Mobile applications are already intensifying users’ interaction with the environment, and 
researchers have made considerable progress in developing sensory devices to provide myriad dimensions 
of information to enrich the user experience.  

However, without strong security foundations, attacks and malfunctions in the IoT will outweigh any of 
its  benefits.  Traditional  protection  mechanisms—lightweight  cryptography,  secure  protocols,  and  privacy 
assurance—are  not  enough.  Rather,  researchers  must  discover  the  full  extent  of  specific  obstacles.  They 
must  analyze  current  security  protocols  and  mechanisms  and  decide  if  such  approaches  are  worth 
integrating into the IoT as is or if adaptations or entirely new designs will better accomplish security goals.  
The  proper  legal  and  technical  framework  is  essential.  To  establish  it,  analysts  must  thoroughly 
understand the risks associated with various IoT scenarios, such as air travel, which has many interrelated 
elements,  including  safety,  privacy,  and  economy[1].  Only  then  is  it  possible  to  justify  the  cost  of 
developing security and privacy mechanisms. 

All  these  requirements  underline  some  critical  first  steps  in  implementing  IoT  security  measures 
successfully: understand the IoT conceptually, evaluate Internet security’s current state, and explore how to 
move  from  solutions  that  meet current requirements and constraints  to those that can reasonably assure a 
secure IoT. 

INFRASTRUCTURE SEEDS 

The “Objects in a Superconnected World” sidebar describes some of the characteristics of the things in 
the envisioned IoT and some existing applications that are arguably partial IoT instances. The path to the 
IoT is not necessary a single step. In fact, it makes far more sense to gradually incorporate IoT applications 
into  the  real  world  by  giving  objects  virtual  personas  and  thinking  outside  the  box.  For  example, 
researchers  could  enhance  fishing  vessels  with  sensors  and  communication  systems  that  offer  shared 

R.Roman,P.Najera,andJ.Lopez,“SecuringtheInternetofThings”,IEEEComputer,vol.44,pp.51-58,2011.http://doi.org/10.1109/MC.2011.291NICSLab.Publications:https://www.nics.uma.es/publicationsservices  about  the  state  of  the  sea  and  other  facets.  Objects  that  belong  to  a  virtual  world  can  be  made 
aware of objects outside that world—including the services that other objects and entities provide. Sensors 
that  monitor  agricultural  fields  can  access  weather  reports  for  the  area  and  adapt  the  irrigation  systems 
accordingly.  Developers  can  also  decrease  system  dependence  on  a  centralized  architecture,  creating 
autonomous applications.  Mobile phones  without Internet  connection in a disaster area  can collaborate to 
propagate the location of a sensor-enabled water source.  

This staggered approach might help  society enjoy  IoT’s benefits as analysts and researchers tackle the 
complexities in its underlying infrastructure. The problems will be both technical and semantic, requiring 
interoperable mechanisms that can both connect entities and help them understand each other. Distributed 
services must be reliable, not only offering availability but also adapting themselves in case of malfunction. 
A governance model must scale to billions of devices all over the world. Within these meta challenges are 
issues such as bootstrapping, mobility, scalability, data processing, standardization, and billing.  

COPING WITH OLD AND NEW THREATS 

Not surprisingly, even a staggered approach to developing the IoT presents a daunting task for security. 
What protection measures are possible as billions of intelligent things cooperate with other real and virtual 
entities  in  random  and  unpredictable  ways?  The  IoT’s  highly  distributed  nature  and  use  of  fragile 
technologies, such as limited-function embedded devices in public areas, create weak links that  malicious 
entities  can  exploit.  Easily  accessible  objects  in  unprotected  zones,  such  as  city  streets,  are  vulnerable  to 
physical  harm.  Like  compromising  botnets,  some  objects  would  try  to  hinder  services  from  the  inside. 
Additional threats include the existence of a domino effect between intertwined services and user profiling 
through data collection and other methods. 

To avoid these threats, the IoT must have strong security foundations built on a holistic view of security 
for all IoT elements at all  stages—from the identification  of objects to the provisioning of services,  from 
the  acquisition  of  data  to  the  governance  of  the  whole  infrastructure.  All  security  mechanisms  must 
consider each object’s lifecycle and services from the very beginning of that object’s existence.  

Protocol and network security 

Heterogeneity  greatly  affects  the  protection  of  the  network  infrastructure.  Highly  constrained  devices 
that use low-bandwidth standards, such as IEEE 802.15.4, must open a secure communication channel with 
more  powerful  devices—for  example,  sensor  nodes  scattered  in  a  smart  city  communicate  with 
smartphones  or  PDAs.  Securing  this  channel  requires  optimal  cryptography  algorithms  and  adequate  key 
management  systems,  as  well  as  security  protocols  that  connect  all  these  devices  through  the  Internet. 
Although  it  is  not  clear  how  many  resources  will  be  available  to  such  constrained  devices  once  the  IoT 
truly  takes  off,  it  is  safe  to  optimize  security  as  much  as  possible  to  improve  the  provision  of  future 
services. 

In  a  bottom-up  approach,  cryptography  is  the  cornerstone  for  network  infrastructure  protection. 
Although it is possible to implement existing  standards,  such as  AES,  some IoT devices, such as passive 
RFID tags, might be extremely constrained. Cryptographic mechanisms must be smaller and faster but with 
little  or  no  reduction  in  security  level.  Mechanisms  could  include  symmetric  algorithms,  hash  functions, 
and random number generators.  

In this approach, cryptography is the bricks and the  mortar is the  key-management infrastructures that 
establish  keying  material,  for  example,  shared  secret  keys.  Making  this  mortar  requires  associating 
previously  unrelated  and  sometimes  highly  constrained  objects  in  an  extremely  dynamic  environment. 
Manual  configuration  works  only  in  small  and  personal  environments,  and  traditional  public-key 
infrastructures will almost certainly not scale to accommodate the IoT’s amalgam of contexts and devices. 
There is also the issue of rekeying devices to keep information flow safe in the long run. 

Further  up  the  network  infrastructure  are  the  communication  layers.  Clearly,  the  IoT  must  extensively 
use  Internet  standards  for  communication  and  service  provision.  Still,  some  devices,  such  as  sensors  that 
check the state of runway lights, will lack the resources to implement the Internet security mechanisms that 
normally  protect  these  kinds  of  interactions.  Therefore,  security  protocols  require  some  forward-looking 
adaptation. Subtle differences between IoT and Internet protocols might lead to gaps in end-to-end security. 
Adaptations  should  not  only  fulfill  the  IoT’s  performance  requirements  but  also  provide  the  protocol’s 

original security properties in the context of the Internet architecture.[2] 

Data and privacy 

Privacy is one of  the  most sensitive  subjects in any discussion of IoT protection. The data availability 
explosion has created Big Brother-like entities that profile and track users without their consent. The IoT’s 
anywhere,  anything,  anytime  nature  could  easily  turn  such  practices  into  a  dystopia.  Users  would  have 
access to an unprecedented number of personalized services, all of which would generate considerable data, 
and the environment itself would be able to acquire information about users automatically.  

Although a dystopia is the worst-case scenario, the IoT could certainly exacerbate a range of undesirable 
situations.  Facebook  accounts  already  affect  a  user’s  employability  and  personal  interactions.  Imagine 
exponentially more such exposure opportunities.   

Privacy by design. One viable solution is privacy by design, in which users would have the tools they 
need to manage their own data. The solution is not too far from current reality. Whenever users produce a 
data fragment, they can already use dynamic consent tools that permit certain services to access as little or 
as  much  of  that  data  as  desired.  Taking  that  idea  a  step  further,  a  user  in  Central  Park  could  provide  a 
location-based service with the information that he’s in New York City, but not that he’s in a specific park. 
Transparency.  Transparency  is  also  essential,  since  users  should  know  which  entities  are  managing 
their data and how and when those entities are using it. Stakeholders such as service providers must be part 
of this equation,  which  might  make  take-it-or-leave-it license agreements  obsolete. Businesses  will adjust 
their services according to the amount of personal data the user provides. 

Data  management.  A  huge  issue  is  deciding  who  manages  the  secrets.  Technically,  cryptographic 
mechanisms and protocols protect data throughout the service’s life cycle, but some entities might lack the 
resources  to  manage  such  mechanisms.  In  other  words,  one  data  management  policy  will  not  fit  all 
situations.  Consequently,  there  must be policies on how to  manage  various  kinds of data as  well as  some 
policy-enforcement  mechanism.  Developing  such  data  management  policies  and  enforcing  them  is  not 
trivial. It requires interpreting, translating, and optimally reconciling a series of rules, each of which might 
be  in  a  different  language.  And  any  policies  must  align  with  legislation  on  data  protection,  which  itself 
could change. 

Identity management 

In  the  IoT,  identity  management  requires  considering  a  staggering  variety  of  identity  and  relationship 

types, according to certain object identity principles:  

  An  object’s  identity  is  not  the  same  as  the  identity  of  its  underlying  mechanisms.  The  x-ray 
machine in the radiology department might have an IP address, but it should also have its own 
identity to distinguish it from other machines.  

  An object can have one core identity and several temporary identities. A hospital can become a 

meeting place for a health conference or a shelter after a fire.  

  An object can identify itself using its identity or its specific features. A virtual food identifies 

itself by its ingredients and quantity. 

  Objects  know  the  identity  of  their  owners.  The  device  that  controls  a  user’s  glucose  level 

should know how that information fits in that user’s overall health.  

Objects  can  also  be  in  groups,  which  some  mechanism  must  manage.  A  house  could  have  several 
appliances  that  only  certain  residents  and  visitors  can  use  at  particular  times.  The  refrigerator  could  lock 
itself after midnight to any resident or visiting teenagers, but remain open for the adults. 

Proving identity is an important part of identity management. As developers create a worldwide network 
of  objects,  they  must  build  an  infrastructure  that  allows  mutual  object  authentication.  There  must  be  a 
balance between centralized management and a distributed, hierarchical approach.  

Mechanisms  for  anonymization  and  the  creation  of  pseudonyms  are  also  important  building  blocks. 
Because the IoT deals with multiple contexts, an entity is not likely to reveal its identity all the time. For 
example, in a vehicular network, a police car can reveal its identity to cars and staff at the police station, 
but keep its identity hidden during undercover work unless it is interacting with other police cars.  

As  these  examples  illustrate,  identify  management  in  the  IoT  offers  both  challenge  and  opportunity  to 
improve security’s practical use. A promising approach is diverse authentication methods for humans and 

machines.  A  user  could  open  an  office  door  using  bioidentification  (such  as  a  fingerprint)  or  an  object 
within  a  personal  network,  such  as  a  passport,  identity  card,  or  smartphone.  Combining  authentication 
methods can prevent any loss of overall system security. Such combinations typically take the form of what 
I am + what I know or what I have + what I know. 

Authorization  is  also  an  identity  management  concern.  Authentication  and  authorization  share  open 
research  issues,  such  as  finding  a  balance  between  centralized  and  distributed  systems  to  answer  the 
question of who’s in charge of defining and publishing roles. However, specific topics, such as delegation, 
fall mainly under the authorization umbrella. An IoT element can delegate certain tasks to other objects for 
a limited time. For example, an object in the user’s personal network, such as his phone, can check on his 
behalf to see if his suitcase contains all the clothes needed for an upcoming conference.  

Granularity is also an authorization issue. The services an object provides might depend on the number 
of  credentials  presented.  For  example,  a  classroom  could  provide  anyone  who  asks  with  the  name  of  the 
course  being  taught,  but  it  would  release  the  syllabus  of  that  course  only  to  students  with  authorization 
certificates from the dean. 

Trust and governance 

Trust is essential to implement the IoT. In this context, trust is more than the mechanisms that reduce the 
uncertainty of objects as they interact, although such mechanisms are important in helping objects choose 
an adequate partner for their needs. In the IoT, such mechanisms must be able to define trust in a dynamic, 
collaborative environment and understand what it means to provide trust throughout an interaction. 

But  trust  also  encompasses  how  users  feel  while  interacting  in  the  IoT.  Feelings  of  helplessness  and 
being  under  some  unknown  external  control  can  greatly  undermine  the  deployment  of  IoT-based 
applications and services. There must be support for controlling the state of the virtual world.  Users must 
be able to control their own services, and they must have tools that accurately describe all their interactions 
so that they can form an accurate mental map of their virtual surroundings. 

Governance  helps  strengthen  trust  in  the  IoT.  A  common  framework  for  security  policies  will  support 
interoperability  and  ensure  security’s  continuity.  Defining  adequate  enforcement  mechanisms  will  go  a 
long way toward simplifying data protection.  

A  governance  framework  can  also  help  reduce  liability.  If  someone  can  attribute  a  malicious  action 
transaction  to  a  particular  user  or  agent,  it  will  be  possible  to  punish  that  user  or  the  agent’s  owner.  But 
governance is a double-edge sword. On the one hand, it offers stability, support for political decisions, and 
a  fair  enforcement  mechanism.  On  the  other  hand,  governance  can  easily  become  excessive,  fostering  an 
environment in which people are continuously monitored and controlled. If the current Internet’s partially 
solved  governance  problem  is  any  indication,  it  will  take  the  combined  efforts  of  several  research 
communities  to  address  the  challenges  of  a  governance  framework  when  countless  stakeholders  and 
billions of objects are added to the mix. 

Fault tolerance 

Clearly, the IoT will be more susceptible to attack than the current Internet, since billions more devices 
will  be  producing  and  consuming  services.  Highly  constrained  devices  will  be  the  most  vulnerable,  and 
malicious entities will seek to control at least some devices either directly or indirectly. In this context, fault 
tolerance is indispensable to assure service reliability, but any solution must be specialized and lightweight 
to account for the number of constrained and easily accessible IoT devices. 

Achieving fault tolerance in the IoT will require three cooperative efforts. The first is to make all objects 
secure  by  default.  Aside  from  designing  secure  protocols  and  mechanisms,  researchers  must  work  on 
improving software implementation quality, since it  might  not be feasible to provide  a software patch for 
billions of devices.  

The second effort is to give all IoT objects the ability to know the state of the network and its services. 
This system would need to give feedback to many other elements; for example, a watchdog system could 
acquire  data  as  part  of  supplying  qualitative  and  quantitative  security  metrics.  An  important  task  in  this 
second effort is to build an accountability system that will help monitor state. 

Finally, objects should be able to defend themselves against network failures and attacks. All protocols 
should  incorporate  mechanisms  that  respond  to  abnormal  situations  and  allow  the  object  to  gracefully 
degrade  its  service.  Objects  should  be  able  to  use  intrusion-detection  systems  and  other  defensive 
mechanisms to ward off attackers.  

Once  an  attack  affects  their  services,  IoT  elements  should  be  able  to  act  quickly  to  recover  from  any 
damage.  Such elements can  use  feedback  from other  mechanisms and IoT entities  to  map the  location of 
unsafe  zones,  where  an  attack  has  caused  service  outages,  and  trusted  zones—areas  with  no  service 
outages.  Such  information  can  be  the  basis  for  implementing  various  recovery  services,  such  as  having 
objects access trusted zone services first. Mechanisms could also inform human operators of any damaged 
zone and then perform maintenance operations. This infrastructure self-management is a key IoT tenet. 

WORK IN PROGRESS 

Researchers,  governments,  and  industries  are  committed  to  developing  and  standardizing  identity  and 
security mechanisms for IoT building blocks. Table 1 lists some of the more mature efforts. The table does 
not  consider  work-in-progress  standards  and  government  recommendations  such  as  EU  recommendation 
C(2009) 3200.  

Although these standards and mechanisms are good first steps, much additional work is required to build 
a robust and secure IoT. Again, the holistic view is important. It is important to protect the IoT’s building 
blocks, but its features create new requirements that are equally important. The design of specific security 
IoT  mechanisms  is  still  in  its  infancy,  but  recent  developments  are  encouraging  and  could  provide  some 
degree of protection to existing IoT applications, such as the different instances of the IBM Smarter Planet 
initiative 
(www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/?ca=v_smarterplanet)  or  ventures  such  as  Pachube 
(https://pachube.com) and Arrayent (http://arrayent.com).

Cryptography and protocols 

Researchers  are  already  making  strides  toward  developing  better  cryptographic  algorithms  and  modes 
for  IoT  devices.  The  ISO/IEC  29192  standards  aim  to  provide  lightweight  cryptography  for  constrained 
devices,  including  block  and  stream  ciphers  and  asymmetric  mechanisms.  As  of  August  2011,  these 
standards  were  still  under  development,  but  some  algorithms  are  available.  Sony’s  CLEFIA  is  a  novel 
block  cipher  that  supports  128-bit  keys  (www.sony.net/Products/cryptography/clefia/about/index.html). 
The  eSTREAM  project  (www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream)  studied  the  robustness  of  stream  ciphers  such  as 
Salsa20/12 and Trivium, which are extremely useful in embedded systems. 

Research  on  lightweight  dedicated  hash  functions  has  just  started.  The  winner  of  the  SHA-3 
competition—scheduled to finish in late 2012—should lay the foundation for more work on a new class of 
hash  functions  for  long-term  security.  The  competition’s  goal  is  to  develop  a  new  cryptographic  hash 
algorithm  that  converts  a  variable  length  message  into  a  short  message  digest.  The  digest  will  be  part  of 
generating  digital  signatures,  message  authentication  codes,  and  many  other  security  applications  in  the 

information infrastructure (http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/index.html). 

It is already possible to construct lightweight hash functions based on lightweight block ciphers.  As an 
alternative  to  these  lightweight  algorithms,  existing  optimizations  in  operational  modes  can  make  data 
processing more efficient. Both AES-CCM and AES-GCM offer data integrity and confidentiality. Another 
optimization  is  algorithm  management  in  a  cross-layer  architecture,  where  various  security  mechanisms 
share one algorithm.[3] 

Other communities, such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, aim to implement Internet standards in 

the IoT. Table 2 lists these standards and their purpose.

Although researchers have met some interim implementation goals, various constraints make it difficult 
to fully achieve security through Internet standards.[2] Developers can tweak the IPsec protocol to provide 
network-layer security between Internet hosts and constrained  devices,[4] but the remaining challenges are 
formidable.  It  will  be  daunting  to  deal  with  the  coexistence  of  strong  link-layer  security  and  IPsec,  for 
example, or the negotiation of keying material. Preshared keys are usable with previously known devices, 
and  public-key  cryptography  is  useful  when  the  constrained  object  behaves  as  a  client,[4]  but  the 
negotiation of dynamic keys between previously unknown entities is still an open problem. 

Identity and ownership  

In certain IoT contexts, single-sign-on (SSO) mechanisms can be useful, since users need to authenticate 
only  once  to  interact  with  various  devices.  However,  traditional  Web  2.0  SSO  such  as  OpenID  and 
Shibboleth were not designed to fulfill certain IoT requirements,[6] such as giving the user control over the 
choice  of  identity  provider.  Other  mechanisms  force  users  to  employ  a  particular  protocol,  which  can  be 
problematic in a heterogeneous environment. Another issue is the lack of support for directional identities, 
in which objects broadcast their identities.  

These issues strongly imply the need to  adapt existing SSO mechanisms or create new ones that better 
fit the IoT. Although some approaches address this need, proposing a hybrid architecture that combines all 
mechanisms through specially crafted middleware,[6] this topic still needs research.  

One approach to verifying device ownership and owner identity is digital shadowing,[7] in which a user 
projects his virtual identity onto logical nodes. Digital shadows are based on the notion that a user’s objects 
act  on  his  behalf  but  do  not  store  his  identity,  only  a  virtual  identity  that  contains  information  about  his 
attributes and the objects’ sessions and interactions  with the architecture. Therefore,  digital shadows only 
implicitly indicate their owner’s identity.  

Figure  1  illustrates  how  digital  shadowing  might  work  with  an  electronic  stethoscope  and  white  coat. 
The  doctor’s  fingerprints  prompt  a  query  to  the  government  database,  while  his  coat  provides  the  digital 
shadow to the hospital database, which checks the doctor’s role. Both authentication aspects (what I am + 
what  I  have)  enable  the  doctor  to  enter  a  certain  hospital  area.  The  stethoscope  records  and  stores  the 
patient’s heartbeats, signs the data on the doctor’s behalf, and stores the data in the hospital database. The 
stethoscope  can  also  check  for  any  heartbeat  anomalies  by  accessing  other  systems  inside  or  outside  the 
hospital. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Figure  1.  Instances  of  digital  shadowing  for  a  doctor. The doctor’s  white  coat  and  electronic  stethoscope 
store his virtual identity and act on his behalf. (Top) The coat and the doctor’s fingerprints are elements of 
an authentication  method.  (Bottom)  As the doctor uses the stethoscope, it not only  records and  stores the 
patient’s heartbeats, but also signs the data on the doctor’s behalf and stores it in the hospital database.  

 

The  coat  and  fingerprint  authentication  scenario  in  Figure  1  might  also  benefit  from  revocable  access 
delegation,[8]  in  which  an  RFID  tag  (the  logical  node)  returns  a  valid  ID  (the  virtual  identity)  only  if  the 
tag’s owner has authorized the reader. These tags are essentially part of the user’s digital shadow because 
they provide no user information (only a number), but any reader with explicit user authorization will know 
that they belong to that user. Because the tags’ ID is not easy to link to its owner and the user can revoke 
authorization at any time, the digital shadow approach also accounts for privacy. 

Privacy protection  

Various approaches are in development to protect the personal information of IoT users. The delegation 
mechanism is one privacy preservation proposal. An unauthorized RFID reader will retrieve only a random 
value, so it will not be able to track the user.  

However, limiting access to the user is not the only protection scenario. In some cases, users will want 
to provide information without revealing too much about themselves. Some solutions in this context let the 
user find others who best match  his preferences, without actually revealing such preferences to everyone. 
Other  schemes  let  users  maintain  their  location  privacy  even  when  making  location-dependent  queries.[9] 
Thus, a user can try to locate someone in the vicinity who likes Beethoven, without explicitly providing his 
own location and music preferences.  

An interesting idea is the privacy coach,[10] in which an RFID reader in a mobile phone scans the tags 
embedded  in  some  object,  such  as  a  loyalty  card,  and  downloads  the  companion  privacy  policy.  If  the 
object’s  privacy  policy  does  not  match  the  user’s  preferences,  the  user  can  choose  not  to  use  the  object. 
Conversely,  whenever  an  RFID  reader  tries  to  read  the  mobile  phone’s  signal,  the  phone  can  check  the 
reader’s privacy policy  and ask  for user consent. Finally, the privacy coach can protect the  user’s private 
physical space, such as a house, by scanning for malicious items or undesirable entities, such as objects left 
to monitor the house without the user’s permission.[11] 

The IoT is already more than a concept. By complying with security requirements, it can fully bloom into 
a  paradigm  that  will  improve  many  aspects  of  daily  life.  Open  problems  remain  in  many  areas,  such  as 
cryptographic  mechanisms,  network  protocols,  data  and  identity  management,  user  privacy,  self-
management,  and  trusted  architectures.  Future  research  must  also  carefully  consider  the  balance  of 
governance  and  legal  frameworks  with  innovation.  Governance  can  sometimes  hinder  innovation,  but 
innovation  in  turn  can  inadvertently  ignore  human  rights.  The  right  balance  will  ensure  stable  progress 
toward  realizing  and  securing  the  IoT  as  envisioned,  and  the  benefits  to  humanity  will  be  well  worth  the 
effort.

SIDEBAR 

Objects in a Superconnected World 

Since  the  IoT’s  inception,  governments  and  other  organizations  have  tried  to  capture  its  essence  in 
words,  some  doing  so  more  successfully  than  others.[A]  In  a  nutshell,  the  IoT  is  a  worldwide  network  of 
interconnected objects. Each object that surrounds a person, from books to cars to appliances and food, has 
a virtual avatar that behaves as an active entity. In this context, all IoT objects have five main characteristics: 

 
Existence.  Things,  such  as  a  car,  exist  in  the  physical  world,  but  specific  technologies,  such  as  an 

embedded communication device, enable the existence of the thing’s virtual personas.  

Sense of self. All things have, either implicitly or explicitly, an identity that describes them, such as car, 
Porsche,  or  license  plate  number.  Objects  can  process  information,  make  decisions,  and  behave 
autonomously. 

Connectivity.  Things  can  open  communication  with  other  entities.  As  a  result,  both  an  element  in  their 

surroundings and a remote entity can locate and access them.  

Interactivity.  Things  can  interoperate  and  collaborate  with  a  wide  range  of  heterogeneous  entities, 

whether human,  machine, real, or virtual, producing and consuming a wide range of services. 

Dynamicity. Things can interact with other things at any time, any place, and in any way. They can enter 
and  leave  the  network  at  will,  need  not  be  limited  to  a  single  physical  location,  and  can  use  a  variety  of 
interfaces. 

 
An  optional  sixth  characteristic  is  environmental  awareness.  Sensors  might  enable  a  thing  to  perceive 
physical  and  virtual  data  about  its  environment,  such  as  water  radiation  or  network  overhead.  This 
characteristic  is  optional  because  not  all  things  will  exhibit  it,  such  as  an  object  enhanced  with  a 
radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag.  

The  combination  of  various  technologies  has  enabled  objects  to  exhibit  these  characteristics,  allowing 
them  to  become  virtual  beings.  Energy-efficient  microcontrollers  act  as  brains,  imbuing  objects  with 
embedded  intelligence.  Sensor  technology  provides  objects  with  sensory  receptors,  and  RFID  provides  a 
way  for  them  to  distinguish  one  another,  much  like  people  recognize  a  face.  Finally,  low-energy  wireless 
technology, such as IEEE 802.15.4, supplies the virtual counterparts of voice and hearing.  

Multiple  applications  already  use 

technologies,  such  as  machine-to-machine 
communication,  virtual  worlds,  and  robotics.  To  be  a  virtual  being,  an  IoT  object  doesn’t  need  all  these 
technologies. What it does need depends on the object and its mission. A tire can simply provide information 
about itself and its state, but a car will be much more technologically complex because it must be aware of 
its surroundings as well as its own state.  

these  and  other 

RFID in pharmaceutical environments, location-aware mobile applications, and smart metering systems 
are  all  essentially  “intranets  of  things,”  in  which  objects  are  isolated  from  those  in  other  scenarios  and 
domains. IoT applications will have greater scope and flexibility, being able to interact not only with objects 

in other scenarios and domains but also with real and virtual entities.  

Figure  A  shows  an  application  involving  a  smart  meter  with  current  capabilities—an  intranet  of  things 

scenario—and a smart meter as part of the IoT.

scenario,  the  meter  interacts  with  the  SCADA  system,  household  members,  other  houses,  and 
emergency personnel. 

 

 

Another  example  is  weather  stations,  which  will  send  anonymous  queries  to  pedestrians’  personal 
networks to create a city temperature and humidity map that business owners can integrate with other data 
to decide the best place to build an ice cream shop. Likewise, virtual supermarket goods will interact with a 
clerk  to  notify  him  of  a  strawberry  yogurt  shortage;  with  a  potentially  allergic  shopper  to  provide  her  with 
ingredient information; and with third-party  applications,  such  as  event  planners,  to  reveal  if  the  shopper’s 
friends like strawberry yogurt.[B] 

At  present,  only  partial  IoT  instances  exist,  mainly  those  that  provide  information  services  through 
centralized systems and interfaces. These IoT application forerunners hint at the possible benefits of a full-
blown IoT and can serve as foundational elements for building  this new virtual world. New companies are 
providing a centralized interface to access  raw sensor data worldwide. Such data can help launch an IoT 
application. The personal network paradigm is another example of a partial instance. Local entities, such as 
wearable  objects,  interact  indirectly  with  external  services,  such  as  a  fitness  monitor,  through  a  central 
server such as a smartphone. In this way, users and their objects interact with their environment, deciding 
what data they want to share and with whom.  These and similar applications are a start, but to attain the 
IoT’s full benefits, work must continue.
