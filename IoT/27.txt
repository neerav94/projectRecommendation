With the widely application of RFID technology, the security of the RFID system 
is increasingly prominent. The communication between RFID tag and Reader adopts 
wireless communication,  which is considered unsafe and  easily attacked by various 
ways[2]. especially on security and privacy protection which has seriously hindered

system. 

For  the  security  requirement  of  different  RFID  tags,  many  solutions  have  been 
proposed  at  present.  These  solutions  are  divided  into  two  kinds  of  mechanisms[3]: 
physical  mechanism  and  password  system.  Physical  mechanism  is  mainly  for  the 
RFID tag which is not suitable for the executive password operation or one-time tag, 
including  Kill  command  mechanism[4],  active  jamming[5],  Blocker  Tag[6],  Ferrari 
cage[7] and so on. Although these physical mechanisms could partly ensure the safety 
of  the  RFID  signal,  these  methods  which  are  limited  used  need  extra  physical 
equipment and increase the RFID system cost. Therefore, the industry more inclines

In  this  section,  we  describe  our  algorithm  for  detecting  sensors  whose  readings 
(measurements)  are  faulty.  Firstly,  we  illustrate  NDHN  by  using  an  aggregation 
session  scenario  example,  and  then  we  present  the  detection  procedure  and  the 
algorithm.

1)  Information  stored  in  the  database  (DB):  the  reader  ID  (R1,R2..Rn),  the  initial 
value  of  each  reader  R1（X1,Y1）..Rn(Xn,Yn);  System  initial  value  (X,Y);  Tag 
information and tag ID (T1,T2,…  Tid); Session key K. 

2) Information stored in the reader (R): the reader ID (Rn), the initial value of the 
reader  Rn(Xn,Yn)    System  initial  value  (X);  the  value  of  Hash(y’||Tid’)  calculated 
previously; Session key K. 

3) Information stored in tag T: System initial value (X,Y); Tag Tid. 

2.2      Authentication process 

1)  The  reader  R  generates  a  random  number  Rr1,  calculates  Hash  (X||Rr1)  and 

sends request and Hash (X||Rr1)|| Rr1 to the tag T. 

2) The tag T calculates Hash(X’||Rr1) compared  with the  Hash (X||Rr1) received 
after  receiving  information.  If  the  Hash(X’||Rr1)  calculated  is  equal  to  the  one 
received,  the  authentication  for  the  reader  R  would  be  accomplished.  If  the 
Hash(X’||Rr1) calculated isn’t equal to the one received, the message would be gave 
up. The tag T calculates Hash (Y’||Tid’) || Hash(X’||Rr1||Tr1) ||Tr1 and sends it.

magnitudes  operations,  which  results  in  the  phenomenon  that  arithmetic  speed  is 
slower and nodes consume  more energy. The protocol allows  the strong computing 
power database to deal with a number of calculations and its calculation load is lighter 
than other protocols. Although the calculation load involved in the tag and the reader 
is  a  little  heavier  than  other  algorithms,  it  is  able  to  meet  the  safety  need  of  RFID 
system overall. 

4      Conclusion 

The article has analyzed RFID security issues in IOT. We propose the RFID Two-
way authentication protocol based on updating variables and securely transmit ID in 
ciphertext form between the reader and the tag through Hash function characteristic 
on purpose to guarantee the privacy of information. Meanwhile, we realize three party 
mutual authentications and solve the problem that RFID security certificate couldn’t 
realize in the tag, the reader and the database so that the internal system counterfeit 
phenomenon  is  defended  effectively.  At  the  same  time,  we  adopt  the  method  to 
periodically  update  system  initial  value  in  order  to  enhance  security  level  and 
overcome various security attacks. Compared with the existing secure authentication 
protocols  and  computational  complexity,  the  protocol  has  a  certain  advantage  on 
algorithm  complexity  and  safety  performance  and  it  has  a  higher  security  and 
practical applicability
