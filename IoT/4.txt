Abstract: In the IoT, things are expected to become active participants where they are able to interact and communicate 
among themselves by exchanging data and information sensed about the environment. For that they react autonomously to 
the real world events and provide services with or without direct human intervention. In this paper we use IOT for energy 
efficient Environmental Conditions sensing and controlling in Home. 

In this paper we will see how to provide fully smart environment condition monitoring by various sensors (Temperature, 
Humidity, Light and Level) for providing necessary data to automatically adjust the comfort level in homes by optimize use 
of energy. We also use prediction here for automatically detection and resolution of any problem in the devices. For that we 
are using Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm for data mining. It will send email or SMS to required technician for service and 
it will also notify the owner. This gives a huge advantage on the smart home systems using IoT.

I. INTRODUCTION 

The  Internet  of  Things,  also  called  The  Internet  of  Objects,  refers  to  a  wireless  network  between  objects  usually  the 

network will be wireless and self-configuring, such as household appliances. [Wikipedia] 

The  term  "Internet  of  Things"  has  come  to  describe  a  number  of  technologies  and  research  disciplines  that  enable  the 

Internet to reach out into the real world of physical objects. [IoT 2008]  

Extending  the  current  Internet  and  providing  connection,  communication,  and  inter-networking  between  devices  and 
physical objects, or Things, is a growing trend that is often referred to as the Internet of Things.The Internet of Things (IoT), 
sometimes referred to as the Internet of Objects, will change everything including ourselves. IoT represents the next evolution 
of  the  Internet,  taking  a  huge  leap  in  its  ability  to  gather,  analyze,  and  distribute  data  that  we  can  turn  into  information, 
knowledge and ultimately, wisdom [3]. 

The Internet of Things (IoTs) can be described as connecting everyday objects like smart-phones, Internet TVs, sensors and 
actuators  to  the  Internet  where  the  devices  are  intelligently  linked  together  enabling  new  forms  of  communication  between 
things and people, and between things themselves [1].  

Now anyone, from anytime and anywhere can have connectivity for anything and it is expected that these connections will 
extend and create an entirely advanced dynamic network. IoTs technology can also be applied to create a new concept and wide 
development space for smart homes to provide intelligence, comfort and to improve the quality of life. Modern advances in 
electronics  and  communications  Technologies  have  lead  to  the  miniaturization  and  improvement  of  the  performance  of 
computers, sensors and networking. These changes have given rise to the development of several home automation technologies 
and systems. According to, home automation can be useful to those who need to Access home appliances while away from their

II. RELATED WORK 

Home automation has been a feature of science fiction writing for many years, but has only become practical since the early 
20th  Century  following  the  widespread  introduction  of  electricity  into  the  home,  and  the  rapid  advancement  of  information 
technology. Early remote control devices began to emerge in the late 1800s. For example, Nikola Tesla patented an idea for the 
remote control of vessels and vehicles in 1898.[7] 

Home Automation is automation of the home, housework or household activity. Home automation may include centralized 
control of lighting, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), appliances, security locks of gates and doors and other 
systems,  to  provide  improved  convenience,  comfort,  energy  efficiency  and  security.  Home  automation  for  the  elderly  and 
disabled can provide increased quality of life for persons who might otherwise require caregivers or institutional care. 

The  popularity  of  home  automation  has  been  increasing  greatly  in  recent  years  due  to  much  higher  affordability  and 
simplicity  through  smartphone  and  tablet  connectivity.  The  concept  of  the  "Internet  of  Things"  has  tied  in  closely  with  the 
popularization of home automation. A home automation system integrates electrical devices in a house with each other. Through 
the integration of information technologies with the home environment, systems and appliances are able to communicate in an 
integrated  manner  which  results  in  convenience,  energy  efficiency,  and  safety  benefits.  However,  problems  with  complexity, 
competition between vendors, multiple incompatible standards and the resulting expense have limited the penetration of home 
automation to homes of the wealthy, or ambitious hobbyists. 

Home automation or smart homes can be described as introduction of technology within the home environment to provide 
convenience, comfort, security and energy efficiency to its occupants [3]. With the introduction of the Internet of Things, the 
research and implementation of home automation are getting more popular [4]. Various wireless technologies that can support 
some form of remote data transfer, sensing and control such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, RFID, and cellular networks have been utilized 
to embed various levels of intelligence in the home [3].  

Many  of  the  home  automation  systems  that  are  commercially  available  can  be  separated  into  two  categories:  locally 
controlled  systems  and  remotely  controlled  systems.  Locally  controlled  systems  use  an  in-home  controller  to  achieve  home 
automation.  This  allows  users  complete  use  of  their  automation  system  from  within  their  home  via  a  stationary  or  wireless 
interface. Remotely controlled systems use an Internet connection or integration with an existing home security system to allow 
the user complete control of their system from their mobile device, personal computer, or via telephone from their home security 
provider. [2] 

There are a number of issues involved when designing a home automation system. It should provide a user- friendly interface 
on the host side, so that the devices can be easily setup, monitored, and controlled. Furthermore the overall system should be swift 
enough  to  realize  the  true  power  of  wireless  technology.  Lastly  the  system  should  be  cost  effective  in  order  to  justify  its 
application in home automation. To minimize the shortcomings of each system and to overcome the design issues previously 
mentioned, this project integrates locally and remotely controlled systems with the use of Cloud data network. This allows the 
system  to  operate  without  the  dependence  of  a  mobile  provider,  allows  the  system  to  be  used  with  various  mobile  phone 
platforms, and allows the system to operate locally when phone or computer access is not available. Cloud networking and data 
infrastructure allow individuals to monitor, manage, and control their personal data points through the Internet [5-7]. One of the 
available services is Pachube [5]. 

In  some  study  also  have  presented  Bluetooth  based  home  automation  systems  using  Android  Smart  phones  without  the 
Internet controllability. The devices are physically connected to a Bluetooth sub-controller which is then accessed and controlled 
by the Smart phone using built-in Bluetooth connectivity. Researchers have also attempted to provide network interoperability 
and remote access to control devices and appliances at home using home gateways. [2]

III. NEED 

 

We  need  energy  efficient,  flexible  system  which  detect  the  fault  in  the  devices  automatically  and  generate  a  recovery 
process to resolve the detected problem. As in many cases some people are not able move much from one place it is essential 
for them to develop a system which requires less human interaction. Also to improve standard of living it is needed to change 
home condition according to the mood of the user without any interruption. So we need a much smart system which provide all 
the above facilities in low price and less energy consumption.   

IV. PROPOSED DESIGN 

•  We use different sensors (light, temp., level, humidity) to collect the data to understand the environmental conditions 

and also to detect any fault in devices. It is necessary to act devices according to the inhabitant requirement. 

•  Home PC continuously monitor sensors values and control the devices accordingly. If problem found it report to cloud 

server. Here user can modify some settings and see the devices functionality and working. 

•  We  build  one  Registration  Application  where  Technicians,  super  market  vendors  and  other  service  provider  will 

register on it. They provide their details like type of service (Sales/Service) and their service timing etc.         

•  Finally Claud Server will apply data mining on data sets. It also mail or SMS Technician and send details to the Owner 

(mail or SMS). We can connect any number of users on cloud server so it support multi user system characteristics. 

•  Here we can use only one cloud server but we can connect many numbers of users to it via pc, or any android devices.

Many  of  the  home  automation  systems  that  are  commercially  available  can  be  separated  into  two  categories:  locally 
controlled  systems  and  remotely  controlled  systems.  Locally  controlled  systems  use  an  in-home  controller  to  achieve  home 
automation.  This  allows  users  complete  use  of  their  automation  system  from  within  their  home  via  a  stationary  or  wireless 
interface. Remotely controlled systems use an Internet connection or integration with an existing home security system to allow 
the user complete control of their system from their mobile device, personal computer, or via telephone from their home security 
provider. [2] 

There are a number of issues involved when designing a home automation system. It should provide a user- friendly interface 
on the host side, so that the devices can be easily setup, monitored, and controlled. Furthermore the overall system should be swift 
enough  to  realize  the  true  power  of  wireless  technology.  Lastly  the  system  should  be  cost  effective  in  order  to  justify  its 
application in home automation. To minimize the shortcomings of each system and to overcome the design issues previously 
mentioned, this project integrates locally and remotely controlled systems with the use of Cloud data network. This allows the 
system  to  operate  without  the  dependence  of  a  mobile  provider,  allows  the  system  to  be  used  with  various  mobile  phone 
platforms, and allows the system to operate locally when phone or computer access is not available. Cloud networking and data 
infrastructure allow individuals to monitor, manage, and control their personal data points through the Internet [5-7]. One of the 
available services is Pachube [5]. 

In  some  study  also  have  presented  Bluetooth  based  home  automation  systems  using  Android  Smart  phones  without  the 
Internet controllability. The devices are physically connected to a Bluetooth sub-controller which is then accessed and controlled 
by the Smart phone using built-in Bluetooth connectivity. Researchers have also attempted to provide network interoperability 
and remote access to control devices and appliances at home using home gateways. [2]

III. NEED 

 

We  need  energy  efficient,  flexible  system  which  detect  the  fault  in  the  devices  automatically  and  generate  a  recovery 
process to resolve the detected problem. As in many cases some people are not able move much from one place it is essential 
for them to develop a system which requires less human interaction. Also to improve standard of living it is needed to change 
home condition according to the mood of the user without any interruption. So we need a much smart system which provide all 
the above facilities in low price and less energy consumption.   

IV. PROPOSED DESIGN 

•  We use different sensors (light, temp., level, humidity) to collect the data to understand the environmental conditions 

and also to detect any fault in devices. It is necessary to act devices according to the inhabitant requirement. 

•  Home PC continuously monitor sensors values and control the devices accordingly. If problem found it report to cloud 

server. Here user can modify some settings and see the devices functionality and working. 

•  We  build  one  Registration  Application  where  Technicians,  super  market  vendors  and  other  service  provider  will 

register on it. They provide their details like type of service (Sales/Service) and their service timing etc.         

•  Finally Claud Server will apply data mining on data sets. It also mail or SMS Technician and send details to the Owner 

(mail or SMS). We can connect any number of users on cloud server so it support multi user system characteristics. 

•  Here we can use only one cloud server but we can connect many numbers of users to it via pc, or any android devices.

                                                                                                                                      Volume 2, Issue 12, December 2014 pg. 243-246 

V. RESULTS 

The system allows the user to control appliances and lights in their home from a smart phones and PC from anywhere in the 

world through an internet connection. It also allows the user to control their units within their home from a wireless remote. 

In  these  papers  we  proposed  a  Novel  technique  that  will  give  us  best  result.  Which  include  prediction  by  providing 
Notifications to the user if problem occurs in any device. First of all we collect different sensor values and analyse it with the 
help of microcontroller. We can monitor and control it with pc or any android device connected to it. If problem found in any 
device we notify owner and the related technician about the problem. We use Naive Bayes classifier algorithm for data mining 
which is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions. 

VI. SCOPE AND FUTURE WORK 

In our  system  we  have  SMS  and  e-mail  notifications  to the  user but  in  future  we  can  add  also  some  voice  alerts.  This 
system  can  be  expanded  to  include various  other options  which  could  include home  security  feature  such  as  open-door and 
motion detection, energy monitoring. 

VII. CONCLUSION 

A Smart Home system integrates electrical devices in a house with each other. The techniques which are going to use in 
home automation include those in building automation as well as the control of domestic activities, such as TV, fan, electric 
tubes,  refrigerator  and  washing  machine.  After  studying  and  understanding  literature  survey  and  other  existing  works,  we 
proposed a Novel technique that will gives us better understanding of the Environmental conditions in home. Our system not 
only just monitors environmental conditions but it acts according to inhabitant requirement. We also provide notification to the 
user about any error occurs in the devices and send mail or SMS to the service provider about the problem. In this paper we are 
planning to eliminate most of the human interaction by providing intelligent system. Development of such Smart Home achieve 
by using Internet of Things technologies. By using these system we can actually manage to make low cost, flexible smart homes 
to adjust its environmental conditions and resolve its errors with energy saving.
