INTRODUCTION 

 
With the development of agriculture in modern society, IOT has been the significant means to reduce costs, improve 
efficiency and achieve intelligent in the field of agriculture. In recent years, the progresses have been made in data 
collection and transmission, intelligent processing and application service in agricultural IOT. For example, the quality 
of agricultural products can be improved by collecting and analyzing the variable of soil and air, monitoring the growth 
of products, balancing the irrigation and fertilization. Additionally, tracing the quality of products can achieve the push 
service in the rural information platform. This can bring tremendous benefits for agriculture.  
 
The agricultural industry is related to the development of rural economic and social stability. The issues about the 
quality of vegetables have aroused the concern in the public. In October 2010,  the notice of "about meat and vegetables 
circulation tracing system construction pilot instruction opinion",  from the ministry of commerce and finance claimed 
that put more effort to resolve the problem of tracing the resource of meat and vegetables can reduce the customers’ 
anxiety to the quality of food. New technology in agricultural IOT such as data collection, RFID, ZigBee, and GPRS 
can be used to recognize the e-mark on the vegetables. Reader can record the information of vegetable in the links of 
producing  and  logistics.  Through  the  internet  and  computer,  the  traceable  network  of  quality  of  vegetable  can  be

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 
Situation of construction of vegetable traceability system  
Construction of intelligent vegetable greenhouse 
Standardizing  the  construction  of  intelligent  vegetable  greenhouse  can  guarantee  the  security  of  green  vegetables. 
Producing  greenhouse  vegetables  has  strict  requirements  to  the  temperature,  humidity,  illumination.  Traditional 
Environmental Monitoring System mainly relies on the cable sensor network environment monitoring system. The data 
transmission relies on conductive medium which is poor mobility and not suitable for maintenance. In order to resolve 
these  problems,  Wang  et  al.  designed  the  intelligent  vegetable  greenhouse  which  use  the  MSP430  single  chip 
microcomputer as core . This greenhouse is systemic, stable and cheap. In addition, it has reserved wireless expansion 
port , which can effectively monitor the temperature , humidity and light in the greenhouse [1]. Zhou et a.l designed 
vegetable greenhouse monitoring system based on the Wireless Sensor Network. This system consists of sensor node, 
ZigBee wireless network technology and the composition of collection terminal, which is secure and stable in terms of 
data collection and transformation[2]. In Jin Zhou, a city of China, the agricultural departments have developed a 
platform to manage the M2M greenhouses. This platform can use  sensor to transfer the parameters ( temperature, 
humidity, light intensity, soil PH, CO2 concentration, etc.) from greenhouse to the communication module, then to the 
M2M platform through GPRS network. If the parameters have reached the threshold value of warning , the alarm will 
be generated. Through the SMS alarm and remote control can manage the greenhouse effectively and  scientifically[3]. 
 
Management of planting vegetable 
Combining  the  modern  agricultural  IOT  technology  and  environmental  monitoring  systems,  the  prospect  of 
scientifically guiding vegetable farming and selling applications is quite rosy. Li et al. who designed a data recording 
and decision supporting system based on PDA to trace the quality and safety of cucumber, through which the system 
can achieve real-time recording and transmission of operational information on the farmlands [4]. Fang et al. who 
designed a Pocket PC (PPC) based farmland information rapid collecting and real-time processing system which can be 
combined with GPS and a wide range of sensors to solve the timely access to spatial and attribute information and 
analytical  processing  problems  in  the  term  of  agriculture  [5].  Wu  et  al,  who  designed  the  intelligent  information 
collecting terminal which consists of the Android smartphone, SQLite database and remote server monitoring software. 
Via  this  terminal,  data  which  includes  texts,  figures  and  videos  could  be  inputted  in  the  farmland  to  improve  the

accountability and reliability of the tracing-data. [6]. Mao et al. developed an IOT based vegetable factory monitoring 
system. Via the development of the IOT systems which encompasses wireless monitoring nodes which are distributed 
in the greenhouses and the key values which set by the experts according to their own experience and knowledge, the 
controlling  system  of  the  vegetable  factory  will  perform  reactions  automatically  to  adjust  the  parameters  of  the 
agricultural production, when some data goes astray from the set value [7]. The Agriculture Bureau of Langfang City 
has developed a vegetable intelligent expertise platform, setting up the greenhouse distribution, greenhouse situation, 
pest  warning,  maturity  forecasting,  crop  model  library,  management  reports,  expert  analysis,  expert  interactive, 
practical operation management and some other items. Based on the Internet access an management, this platform 
reveals the vegetable planting, transporting and selling which covers all aspects of information management [8]. 
 
The link of processing and transportation 
Integrated electronic label, bar code technology, sensors, communication network and computer network technology. 
The quality of farm products can be tracked, intelligent delivery by those technologies above.  Lu etc developed the 
RFID  health  security  electronic  information  system  and  set  up  the  standard  of  planting,  fabricating,  packaging, 
transporting, they realized the track of farm products form farm to restaurant[9]. Wang etc integrated RF recognition 
and communication technology into vegetable track system, and they designed the vegetable track system based on 
internet  of  things.  By  the  internet  of  things,  they  can  realized  the  automatic  data  acquisition  and  automatic 
transmission[10]. Hsueh etc designed the real-time control and monitor system for those perishable products, they store 
those collected information and mark preservation period in RFID electronic label. Then, they use RFID reader to read 
the information in electronic label and send those information to computer system. When the food quality and storage 
environment become poor, the distribution center will remove those bad food in order to improve the transmission 
environment, those steps will follow the information on the RFID electronic label[11].   
 
The link of consumption 
As the establishment of mobile terminal, supermarket inquiry terminal and tracking website, consumers can receive 
feedback from software platform, send the demand information to production bases and track the quality of every batch 
of vegetable. Consumers can also receive the production information and videos to confirm the quality of the organic 
vegetables.  Cheng    and  his  team  designed  the  Agricultural  Production  Quality  and  Safety  Tracking  Intelligent 
Terminal,  which  is  based  on  B/S  Agricultural  Production  Quality  Tracking  System  and  C/S  Intelligent  Terminal 
Quality and Safety Inquiry  System.  This  terminal  can  construct  a  quality  control  platform  for  companies,  provide 
service to consumers, and realize the tracking for agricultural production[12]. 
 
The Constitution of platform of vegetable traceability system 
In 2004, Shou Guang implemented the vegetable security traceability information system consisting of three parts 
which are enterprise management, data platform of food quality and query terminals. This can guarantee the unique 
identify a packing unit vegetables in each process to realize the unify. Yan et al. built up the  vegetables product safety 
traceability information system  based on the QR code to manage the whole process from vegetable production to 
market . Therefore, the vegetable industry can be promoted [13,14]. Fu et al. utilize the technology of  RFID, QR code, 
ASP.Net,  component  development  technology  to  develop  the  vegetable  traceability  system  which  can  provide  the 
detailed information about vegetables and a operational platform to manage and control the quality of vegetables for 
enterprise[15,16] .   
 
Problems of vegetable traceability system 
More progresses need to be made in vegetable traceability system 
At present, most of the farmers possess  low  degree  of  organization  in  China.  Vegetables  are  mainly  sold  through 
farmer's market as well as the existence of numerous circulations, no packaging, and the uncontrollability of quality. 
Therefore, the traceability system construction, which involve before, during and after the production, needs to be 
improved. 

 

The standardization of agricultural IOT technology needs to be further standardized 
During  the  development  of  agricultural  IOT  technology,  various  new  technologies  emerge  in  the  process  of  data 
sensing,  acquisition,  transmission,  analysis,  application.  Due  to  different  technical  solutions,  the  standard  of  data 
perception layer and data model are not unified so that they not only cannot relate to each other but also cost higher for 
development.  All  of  these  would  hinder  the  development  of  agricultural  IOT  technology.  Therefore,  organize  an 
effective  management  department  to  design  relevant  policies  and  regulations,  speed  up  the  establishment, 
implementation and application of key standards is very necessary.

The Constitution of platform of vegetable traceability system 
In 2004, Shou Guang implemented the vegetable security traceability information system consisting of three parts 
which are enterprise management, data platform of food quality and query terminals. This can guarantee the unique 
identify a packing unit vegetables in each process to realize the unify. Yan et al. built up the  vegetables product safety 
traceability information system  based on the QR code to manage the whole process from vegetable production to 
market . Therefore, the vegetable industry can be promoted [13,14]. Fu et al. utilize the technology of  RFID, QR code, 
ASP.Net,  component  development  technology  to  develop  the  vegetable  traceability  system  which  can  provide  the 
detailed information about vegetables and a operational platform to manage and control the quality of vegetables for 
enterprise[15,16] .   
 
Problems of vegetable traceability system 
More progresses need to be made in vegetable traceability system 
At present, most of the farmers possess  low  degree  of  organization  in  China.  Vegetables  are  mainly  sold  through 
farmer's market as well as the existence of numerous circulations, no packaging, and the uncontrollability of quality. 
Therefore, the traceability system construction, which involve before, during and after the production, needs to be 
improved. 

 

The standardization of agricultural IOT technology needs to be further standardized 
During  the  development  of  agricultural  IOT  technology,  various  new  technologies  emerge  in  the  process  of  data 
sensing,  acquisition,  transmission,  analysis,  application.  Due  to  different  technical  solutions,  the  standard  of  data 
perception layer and data model are not unified so that they not only cannot relate to each other but also cost higher for 
development.  All  of  these  would  hinder  the  development  of  agricultural  IOT  technology.  Therefore,  organize  an 
effective  management  department  to  design  relevant  policies  and  regulations,  speed  up  the  establishment, 
implementation and application of key standards is very necessary.

The equipment cost is waiting to be reduced 
At present, the agricultural environment and devices of vegetable information collection, transmission and perception 
are  relatively  expensive.  They  are  only  used  in  some  high  value  crops  or  large  vegetable  greenhouses  instead  of 
promoting in large-scale. How to change the farmers in terms of cost barriers will become the current primary issue. 
Therefore, on the premise that cost has not yet to reach popularity, the development of agricultural IOT will be difficult. 
 
The power consumption of farmland wireless sensor network need to be resolved 
Considering the long-cycle growth of vegetable and large number of sensor nodes, it is a crucial problem for large-scale 
farmland planting oriented wireless sensor network (WSN) to convert green light energy into electrical energy and 
lengthen the operation cycle of the network effectively. 
 
The construction of technical personnel team remains to be further strengthened 
Agricultural  IOT  is  a  multidisciplinary  technology.  As  an  emerging  technology,  it  possesses  high  technical 
requirements. Technical extension workers need not only possess solid knowledge of agricultural extension, but also 
master the modern information technology. At present, the marketing personnel at the grass-roots level still need the 
further training of modern information technology so that agricultural IOT can be widely applied at the grassroots level 
. 
Security needs to be further improved 
Agricultural IOT wireless sensor technology is mainly consist of RFID and bar code, which are also a huge hidden 
security trouble. Easily illegal reading and modification of labels information, valid identity pretend and cheat, label 
illegal tracking and so on form vicious competition. Therefore, it is necessary to build a strong security technology 
system to ensure the safety, real-time and effective of data. 
 

CONCLUSION 

 
Along with the comprehensive work of safe traceability of the quality of agricultural products in our country, many 
cities have implement the traceability management platform. Diversified electronic tag has set up a platform for safe 
traceability of the quality of agricultural products and a logistics distribution system, realizing the tracking and tracing 
of safe traceability of the quality of agricultural products. The consumers will trust more on agricultural products which 
have traceability mark logo. Safe traceability of the quality of agricultural products using agricultural IOT as core 
technology and logistics distribution technology system can improve the enthusiasm of producers, circulators, and 
consumers, improving the credibility of each other. All of these will drive the formation and development of related 
industrial chain, form a virtuous circle, and create a wide prospect of market.
