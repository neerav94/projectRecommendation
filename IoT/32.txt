1 Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally network of networks with Internet
as backbone. It associates diverse sensors, actuators, computing system to
provide intelligent services to human society. It comprises sensing network
with different constrained sensors. These sensors detect environmental condi-
tion, send this sensing information to backend computing system over Internet.
Backend interprets sensed data, sometimes it is done by sensor/sensor-gateway

1 Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally network of networks with Internet
as backbone. It associates diverse sensors, actuators, computing system to
provide intelligent services to human society. It comprises sensing network
with different constrained sensors. These sensors detect environmental condi-
tion, send this sensing information to backend computing system over Internet.
Backend interprets sensed data, sometimes it is done by sensor/sensor-gateway

tors or to other user devices like mobile phones which are also constrained in
nature.

[1] Discusses different visions of IoT. In [2] functionalities and compo-

nents of middleware for IoT architecture are presented.

Figure 1 depicts the said communication components of IoT. It is evident
from above ﬁgure that IoT architecture needs to address the limitations of
constrained network acting as networks of data producers as well as data
consumers.

The very purpose of IoT is to make things smart [14]. Different use cases

and technologies of IoT are depicted in Figure 2 below.

Diverse technologies, software, applications are building blocks of IoT.
Many standard organizations are putting effort to deﬁne IoT reference archi-
tecture emphasizing machine to machine (M2M) communication which is
pragmatic to deﬁne functional modules of IoT architecture.

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) [3], ITU-T (In-
ternational Telecommunication Union) [8], TIA (Telecommunications Indus-
try Association) [9], OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) [12], GISFI (Global ICT
Standardization Forum for India) [11], CCSA (China communication standard
association) [10], CASAGRAS (coordination and support action for global
RFID-related activities and standardization) are some examples of such stan-
dard organizations working on IoT and M2M communication. Figure 3 depicts
different standard bodies working in different areas and use-cases of IoT.

A state-of-the-art in M2M communications, in terms of standardization
bodies, research projects, protocols, etc. along with application programming
interfaces (API) for endpoints of IoT communication network is analyzed
in [13]. Figure 4 shows association among ETSI, OMA, TIA etc. Diversity
is key factor of IoT therefore interoperation is a major challenge to achieve
this diversity. Different categories of interoperability like semantic, syntactic,
technical and organizational are presented in [4]. Figure 5 represents different

interoperation.

Technical interoperability deﬁnes association with hardware/software, sys-
tems and platforms enabling M2M communication. This generally uses mainly
communication protocols and the infrastructure needed for those protocols to
operate [4].

Above stated facts clearly indicate that diversity is an inherent property
of IoT. The facts discussed above also indicate that there are 1) lack of com-
prehensive reference architectures, and 2) lack of technical interoperability
evaluation scopes. Therefore there is a need to address these gaps.

that can provide more uniform interface to IoT service platform layer. It is also
possible that a capable device can implement both IoT device and gateway
layer/functionality into a single physical entity and connects to IoT service
platform layer through the core network.

• IoT Service Platform Layer
This deﬁnes and provides different IoT service abstractions that can be
used by multiple applications. There can be a set of platform services from the
IoT platform infrastructure. Further the same framework can be extended to
application services where some of the reusable application components are
available as services.

The physical entities involved in the above three layers need suitable
communication infrastructure for information exchange. While device layer
addresses this requirement using various legacy technologies which are out
of scope for this document, the gateway layer and service platform layer are
expected to be connected over an IoT Core / Backbone network. The IoT Core
is envisaged to be predominantly an IP based network and that is in line with
the vision of IoT. This IP connectivity could be supported over multitudes of
telecommunication infrastructures such as DSL, Cellular networks (2G, 3G,
4G) etc.

• IoT Application Layer
This layer consists of different IoT applications.
GISFI IoT architecture has following interface reference points at the
• I1: Interface from device layer to gateway layer,
• I2: Interface from gateway layer to service platform layer through IoT
core network
• I3: Interface from service platform to layer speciﬁc vertical applications
Each of these interface points will beneﬁt from a standardized informa-
tion exchange because of the diversity of devices, manufacturers, service
providers, and service consumers involved. Each of these interface points
are expected to support a set of specialized capabilities which may form a
set of standardized adapters designed for purpose. These adapters may im-
plement existing protocols or needs new developments or extension based
on requirements gathered from various IoT use cases. Figure 9 shows the
GISFI IoT interfaces. Functionalities of these interfaces are summarized in

2.2 GISFI IoT Architecture
In this section we present generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI –IoT- WG. The IoT reference architecture of GISFI follows conceptual
model presented in ﬁgure [6].

GISFI IoT reference architecture is partitioned into four layers namely
device layer, gateway layer, service platform layer and application layer.
Different layers are described in brief below following the GISFI – IoT-
contribution [6].

• IoT Device Layer
IoT devices are included in this layer. This layer consists of individual
sensors, network enabled objects and capillary networks consisting of data
sources that are near to the physical environment. It includes heterogeneous
devices (including sensors and actuators) supporting diverse communication
standards such as Zigbee, ZWave, ANTS andWi-Fi, etc.

• IoT Gateway Layer
This layer consists of IoT gateways. The substantial heterogeneity of de-
vices and technologies hosted by the device layer is abstracted using gateways

that can provide more uniform interface to IoT service platform layer. It is also
possible that a capable device can implement both IoT device and gateway
layer/functionality into a single physical entity and connects to IoT service
platform layer through the core network.

• IoT Service Platform Layer
This deﬁnes and provides different IoT service abstractions that can be
used by multiple applications. There can be a set of platform services from the
IoT platform infrastructure. Further the same framework can be extended to
application services where some of the reusable application components are
available as services.

The physical entities involved in the above three layers need suitable
communication infrastructure for information exchange. While device layer
addresses this requirement using various legacy technologies which are out
of scope for this document, the gateway layer and service platform layer are
expected to be connected over an IoT Core / Backbone network. The IoT Core
is envisaged to be predominantly an IP based network and that is in line with
the vision of IoT. This IP connectivity could be supported over multitudes of
telecommunication infrastructures such as DSL, Cellular networks (2G, 3G,
4G) etc.

interfaces of these layers stated above.

• IoT Application Layer
This layer consists of different IoT applications.
GISFI IoT architecture has following interface reference points at the
• I1: Interface from device layer to gateway layer,
• I2: Interface from gateway layer to service platform layer through IoT
core network
• I3: Interface from service platform to layer speciﬁc vertical applications
Each of these interface points will beneﬁt from a standardized informa-
tion exchange because of the diversity of devices, manufacturers, service
providers, and service consumers involved. Each of these interface points
are expected to support a set of specialized capabilities which may form a
set of standardized adapters designed for purpose. These adapters may im-
plement existing protocols or needs new developments or extension based
on requirements gathered from various IoT use cases. Figure 9 shows the
GISFI IoT interfaces. Functionalities of these interfaces are summarized in
Table 1 [6].

1 Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally network of networks with Internet
as backbone. It associates diverse sensors, actuators, computing system to
provide intelligent services to human society. It comprises sensing network
with different constrained sensors. These sensors detect environmental condi-
tion, send this sensing information to backend computing system over Internet.
Backend interprets sensed data, sometimes it is done by sensor/sensor-gateway

tors or to other user devices like mobile phones which are also constrained in
nature.

[1] Discusses different visions of IoT. In [2] functionalities and compo-

nents of middleware for IoT architecture are presented.

Figure 1 depicts the said communication components of IoT. It is evident
from above ﬁgure that IoT architecture needs to address the limitations of
constrained network acting as networks of data producers as well as data
consumers.

The very purpose of IoT is to make things smart [14]. Different use cases

and technologies of IoT are depicted in Figure 2 below.

Diverse technologies, software, applications are building blocks of IoT.
Many standard organizations are putting effort to deﬁne IoT reference archi-
tecture emphasizing machine to machine (M2M) communication which is
pragmatic to deﬁne functional modules of IoT architecture.

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) [3], ITU-T (In-
ternational Telecommunication Union) [8], TIA (Telecommunications Indus-
try Association) [9], OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) [12], GISFI (Global ICT
Standardization Forum for India) [11], CCSA (China communication standard
association) [10], CASAGRAS (coordination and support action for global
RFID-related activities and standardization) are some examples of such stan-
dard organizations working on IoT and M2M communication. Figure 3 depicts
different standard bodies working in different areas and use-cases of IoT.

A state-of-the-art in M2M communications, in terms of standardization
bodies, research projects, protocols, etc. along with application programming
interfaces (API) for endpoints of IoT communication network is analyzed
in [13]. Figure 4 shows association among ETSI, OMA, TIA etc. Diversity
is key factor of IoT therefore interoperation is a major challenge to achieve
this diversity. Different categories of interoperability like semantic, syntactic,
technical and organizational are presented in [4]. Figure 5 represents different

levels of interoperation by considering technical interoperation as core of
interoperation.

Technical interoperability deﬁnes association with hardware/software, sys-
tems and platforms enabling M2M communication. This generally uses mainly
communication protocols and the infrastructure needed for those protocols to
operate [4].

Above stated facts clearly indicate that diversity is an inherent property
of IoT. The facts discussed above also indicate that there are 1) lack of com-
prehensive reference architectures, and 2) lack of technical interoperability
evaluation scopes. Therefore there is a need to address these gaps.

In this article we address the ﬁrst gap by presenting a conceptual model
of IoT, and also presenting a generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI standard body.

IoT reference architecture, its functional modules and interfaces deﬁned
by different standard bodies mainly ETSI and GISFI are compared here. Fur-
ther based on these comparisons we discuss scope of technical interoperation

aspects among said standard-bodies to address the second gap. None of above
literatures perform an extensive study in this regard.

Establishing interoperation across various IoT reference architectures deﬁned
by different standard organizations speciﬁcally to make them technically in-
teroperable is explored in this document. The architectures consisting multiple
layers like sensors, core-network, service platform and applications possess
technical interoperability. We have elaborated architecture and functionalities
of reference interfaces proposed by GISFI. Elaboration of interfaces speciﬁed
in GISFI IoT reference architecture addressing major requirements of various
use-case scenarios is work in progress in that work group. We have compared
functionalities of proposed interfaces of reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI and GISFI. Establishing low overhead secured path with unique naming
and addressing mechanism is still an open area for standardization. We believe
bringing different standards semantically and syntactically interoperable by
addressing main requirements of IoT framework like diverse and distributed
computing environment, low overhead communication medium, support of
critical events, and human machine interaction is another research area and
candidate for standardization.

chitectures proposed by different standards institutes, specially emphasizing
lightweight requirements of IoT reference architecture. These architectures
deﬁne multiple interfaces. Functionalities of proposed interfaces are compared
here to enable an understanding regarding the scope of interoperation among
different IoT standards. Finally, future scopes for standardization in IoT are

Keywords: IoT, Standardization body, lightweight.

1 Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally network of networks with Internet
as backbone. It associates diverse sensors, actuators, computing system to
provide intelligent services to human society. It comprises sensing network
with different constrained sensors. These sensors detect environmental condi-
tion, send this sensing information to backend computing system over Internet.
Backend interprets sensed data, sometimes it is done by sensor/sensor-gateway

locally, takes decisions, and routs these decisions to local applications, actua-
tors or to other user devices like mobile phones which are also constrained in
nature.

[1] Discusses different visions of IoT. In [2] functionalities and compo-

nents of middleware for IoT architecture are presented.

Figure 1 depicts the said communication components of IoT. It is evident
from above ﬁgure that IoT architecture needs to address the limitations of
constrained network acting as networks of data producers as well as data
consumers.

The very purpose of IoT is to make things smart [14]. Different use cases

and technologies of IoT are depicted in Figure 2 below.

Diverse technologies, software, applications are building blocks of IoT.
Many standard organizations are putting effort to deﬁne IoT reference archi-
tecture emphasizing machine to machine (M2M) communication which is
pragmatic to deﬁne functional modules of IoT architecture.

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) [3], ITU-T (In-
ternational Telecommunication Union) [8], TIA (Telecommunications Indus-
try Association) [9], OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) [12], GISFI (Global ICT
Standardization Forum for India) [11], CCSA (China communication standard
association) [10], CASAGRAS (coordination and support action for global
RFID-related activities and standardization) are some examples of such stan-
dard organizations working on IoT and M2M communication. Figure 3 depicts
different standard bodies working in different areas and use-cases of IoT.

A state-of-the-art in M2M communications, in terms of standardization
bodies, research projects, protocols, etc. along with application programming
interfaces (API) for endpoints of IoT communication network is analyzed
in [13]. Figure 4 shows association among ETSI, OMA, TIA etc. Diversity
is key factor of IoT therefore interoperation is a major challenge to achieve
this diversity. Different categories of interoperability like semantic, syntactic,
technical and organizational are presented in [4]. Figure 5 represents different

levels of interoperation by considering technical interoperation as core of
interoperation.

Technical interoperability deﬁnes association with hardware/software, sys-
tems and platforms enabling M2M communication. This generally uses mainly
communication protocols and the infrastructure needed for those protocols to
operate [4].

Above stated facts clearly indicate that diversity is an inherent property
of IoT. The facts discussed above also indicate that there are 1) lack of com-
prehensive reference architectures, and 2) lack of technical interoperability
evaluation scopes. Therefore there is a need to address these gaps.

In this article we address the ﬁrst gap by presenting a conceptual model
of IoT, and also presenting a generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI standard body.

IoT reference architecture, its functional modules and interfaces deﬁned
by different standard bodies mainly ETSI and GISFI are compared here. Fur-
ther based on these comparisons we discuss scope of technical interoperation

Interoperation among IoT Standards 257

aspects among said standard-bodies to address the second gap. None of above
literatures perform an extensive study in this regard.

2 IoT Reference Architecture

In this section we present conceptual model of IoT, and its reference architec-
ture proposed by different standard body. IoT architecture constitutes mainly
four layers like sensor or thing layer, network layer, service, and application
layer.

Both ETSI, and GISFI reference architecture for M2M and IoT support

this conceptual model. Figure 6 depicts the conceptual model of IoT.

2.1 ETSI Reference Architecture

ETSI high level reference architecture possesses two domains as stated below
[15].

1. The device and gateway Domain.

It is composed of the following elements:
M2M device: A device that runs M2M application(s) using M2M ser-
vice capabilities. M2M devices connect to network domain using a direct

Figure 6 Conceptual model of IoT [5].

258 S. Bandyopadhyay, P. Balamuralidhar and Arpan Pal

connectivity, or using gateway as a network proxy. M2M devices may be
connected to the networks domain via multiple M2M gateways.

M2M area network: provides connectivity between M2M Devices and
M2M Gateways. Examples of M2M Area Networks include: Personal Area
Network technologies such as IEEE 802.15.1, Zigbee, Bluetooth, IETF ROLL,
etc. or local networks such as PLC, M-BUS, Wireless M-BUS and KNX.

M2M gateway: A gateway runs M2M Application(s) using M2M service
capabilities. The gateway acts as a proxy between M2M devices and the
network domain.

2. The network domain

It is composed of following elements:
Access network: Network which allows the M2M device and gateway
domain to communicate with the core network. Access Networks include
(but are not limited to): xDSL, HFC, satellite, GERAN, UTRAN, eUTRAN,
W-LAN and WiMAX.

Core network:
It provides following:

IPconnectivity at a minimum and potentially other connectivity means.
Service and network control functions.
Interconnection (with other networks).
Roaming.
Different Core Networks offer different features sets.
Core Networks (CNs) include (but are not limited to) 3GPP CNs, ETSI
TISPAN CN and 3GPP2 CN.

M2M service capabilities:

Provide M2M functions that are to be shared by different applications.
Expose functions through a set of open interfaces.
Use core network functionalities.
Simplify and optimize application development and deployment through
hiding of network speciﬁcities.

M2M applications: Applications that run the service logic and use M2M

Service capabilities accessible via an open interface.

Figure 7 ETSI Reference Architecture [15].

ETSI M2M architecture has following interface reference points [15].

Reference points are described below based on [15].
mIa Reference Point:
Allows a network application to access M2M service capabilities in the net-
work domain. The mIa reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation
[16].
dIa Reference Point:
Allows a device application residing in an M2M device to access the different
M2M service capabilities in the same M2M device or in an M2M gateway;
allows a gateway residing in an M2M gateway to access different M2M service
capabilities in the same M2M gateway. The dIa reference point shall comply
with speciﬁcation [16].
mId Reference Point:
Allows an M2M service capabilities residing in an M2M device or M2M
gateway to communicate with M2M service capabilities in network Domain
and vice versa. mId uses core network connectivity functions as an underlying
layer. The mId reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation [16].

2.2 GISFI IoT Architecture
In this section we present generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI –IoT- WG. The IoT reference architecture of GISFI follows conceptual
model presented in ﬁgure [6].

GISFI IoT reference architecture is partitioned into four layers namely
device layer, gateway layer, service platform layer and application layer.
Different layers are described in brief below following the GISFI – IoT-
contribution [6].

• IoT Device Layer
IoT devices are included in this layer. This layer consists of individual
sensors, network enabled objects and capillary networks consisting of data
sources that are near to the physical environment. It includes heterogeneous
devices (including sensors and actuators) supporting diverse communication
standards such as Zigbee, ZWave, ANTS andWi-Fi, etc.

• IoT Gateway Layer
This layer consists of IoT gateways. The substantial heterogeneity of de-
vices and technologies hosted by the device layer is abstracted using gateways

Interoperation among IoT Standards 261

that can provide more uniform interface to IoT service platform layer. It is also
possible that a capable device can implement both IoT device and gateway
layer/functionality into a single physical entity and connects to IoT service
platform layer through the core network.

• IoT Service Platform Layer
This deﬁnes and provides different IoT service abstractions that can be
used by multiple applications. There can be a set of platform services from the
IoT platform infrastructure. Further the same framework can be extended to
application services where some of the reusable application components are
available as services.

The physical entities involved in the above three layers need suitable
communication infrastructure for information exchange. While device layer
addresses this requirement using various legacy technologies which are out
of scope for this document, the gateway layer and service platform layer are
expected to be connected over an IoT Core / Backbone network. The IoT Core
is envisaged to be predominantly an IP based network and that is in line with
the vision of IoT. This IP connectivity could be supported over multitudes of
telecommunication infrastructures such as DSL, Cellular networks (2G, 3G,
4G) etc.

interfaces of these layers stated above.

• IoT Application Layer
This layer consists of different IoT applications.
GISFI IoT architecture has following interface reference points at the
• I1: Interface from device layer to gateway layer,
• I2: Interface from gateway layer to service platform layer through IoT
core network
• I3: Interface from service platform to layer speciﬁc vertical applications
Each of these interface points will beneﬁt from a standardized informa-
tion exchange because of the diversity of devices, manufacturers, service
providers, and service consumers involved. Each of these interface points
are expected to support a set of specialized capabilities which may form a
set of standardized adapters designed for purpose. These adapters may im-
plement existing protocols or needs new developments or extension based
on requirements gathered from various IoT use cases. Figure 9 shows the
GISFI IoT interfaces. Functionalities of these interfaces are summarized in
Table 1 [6].

2.3 ETSI and GISFI standard-organization comparison and

scope of their interoperation

This section presents scope of technical interoperation between ETSI and
GISFI standards.

Comparison of interfaces proposed by GISFI– IoT–WG and ETSI-M2M-
WG are presented in table 2 below based on the GISFI contribution [7]. M2M
and IoT reference architecture of ETSI and GISFI indicating interfaces are
presented in Figure 10.

Table 2 represents comparisons of interfaces of ETSI M2M and GISFI
IoT reference architecture. GISFI IoT architecture proposes three (I1, I2,

Abstract

This article presents generic IoT (Internet of Things) reference architecture
proposed by standard organization. It compares different IoT reference ar-
chitectures proposed by different standards institutes, specially emphasizing
lightweight requirements of IoT reference architecture. These architectures
deﬁne multiple interfaces. Functionalities of proposed interfaces are compared
here to enable an understanding regarding the scope of interoperation among
different IoT standards. Finally, future scopes for standardization in IoT are
presented.

Keywords: IoT, Standardization body, lightweight.

1 Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally network of networks with Internet
as backbone. It associates diverse sensors, actuators, computing system to
provide intelligent services to human society. It comprises sensing network
with different constrained sensors. These sensors detect environmental condi-
tion, send this sensing information to backend computing system over Internet.
Backend interprets sensed data, sometimes it is done by sensor/sensor-gateway

locally, takes decisions, and routs these decisions to local applications, actua-
tors or to other user devices like mobile phones which are also constrained in
nature.

[1] Discusses different visions of IoT. In [2] functionalities and compo-

nents of middleware for IoT architecture are presented.

Figure 1 depicts the said communication components of IoT. It is evident
from above ﬁgure that IoT architecture needs to address the limitations of
constrained network acting as networks of data producers as well as data
consumers.

The very purpose of IoT is to make things smart [14]. Different use cases

and technologies of IoT are depicted in Figure 2 below.

Diverse technologies, software, applications are building blocks of IoT.
Many standard organizations are putting effort to deﬁne IoT reference archi-
tecture emphasizing machine to machine (M2M) communication which is
pragmatic to deﬁne functional modules of IoT architecture.

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) [3], ITU-T (In-
ternational Telecommunication Union) [8], TIA (Telecommunications Indus-
try Association) [9], OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) [12], GISFI (Global ICT
Standardization Forum for India) [11], CCSA (China communication standard
association) [10], CASAGRAS (coordination and support action for global
RFID-related activities and standardization) are some examples of such stan-
dard organizations working on IoT and M2M communication. Figure 3 depicts
different standard bodies working in different areas and use-cases of IoT.

A state-of-the-art in M2M communications, in terms of standardization
bodies, research projects, protocols, etc. along with application programming
interfaces (API) for endpoints of IoT communication network is analyzed
in [13]. Figure 4 shows association among ETSI, OMA, TIA etc. Diversity
is key factor of IoT therefore interoperation is a major challenge to achieve
this diversity. Different categories of interoperability like semantic, syntactic,
technical and organizational are presented in [4]. Figure 5 represents different

levels of interoperation by considering technical interoperation as core of
interoperation.

Technical interoperability deﬁnes association with hardware/software, sys-
tems and platforms enabling M2M communication. This generally uses mainly
communication protocols and the infrastructure needed for those protocols to
operate [4].

Above stated facts clearly indicate that diversity is an inherent property
of IoT. The facts discussed above also indicate that there are 1) lack of com-
prehensive reference architectures, and 2) lack of technical interoperability
evaluation scopes. Therefore there is a need to address these gaps.

In this article we address the ﬁrst gap by presenting a conceptual model
of IoT, and also presenting a generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI standard body.

IoT reference architecture, its functional modules and interfaces deﬁned
by different standard bodies mainly ETSI and GISFI are compared here. Fur-
ther based on these comparisons we discuss scope of technical interoperation

Interoperation among IoT Standards 257

aspects among said standard-bodies to address the second gap. None of above
literatures perform an extensive study in this regard.

2 IoT Reference Architecture

In this section we present conceptual model of IoT, and its reference architec-
ture proposed by different standard body. IoT architecture constitutes mainly
four layers like sensor or thing layer, network layer, service, and application
layer.

Both ETSI, and GISFI reference architecture for M2M and IoT support

this conceptual model. Figure 6 depicts the conceptual model of IoT.

2.1 ETSI Reference Architecture

ETSI high level reference architecture possesses two domains as stated below
[15].

1. The device and gateway Domain.

It is composed of the following elements:
M2M device: A device that runs M2M application(s) using M2M ser-
vice capabilities. M2M devices connect to network domain using a direct

Figure 6 Conceptual model of IoT [5].

258 S. Bandyopadhyay, P. Balamuralidhar and Arpan Pal

connectivity, or using gateway as a network proxy. M2M devices may be
connected to the networks domain via multiple M2M gateways.

M2M area network: provides connectivity between M2M Devices and
M2M Gateways. Examples of M2M Area Networks include: Personal Area
Network technologies such as IEEE 802.15.1, Zigbee, Bluetooth, IETF ROLL,
etc. or local networks such as PLC, M-BUS, Wireless M-BUS and KNX.

M2M gateway: A gateway runs M2M Application(s) using M2M service
capabilities. The gateway acts as a proxy between M2M devices and the
network domain.

2. The network domain

It is composed of following elements:
Access network: Network which allows the M2M device and gateway
domain to communicate with the core network. Access Networks include
(but are not limited to): xDSL, HFC, satellite, GERAN, UTRAN, eUTRAN,
W-LAN and WiMAX.

Core network:
It provides following:

IPconnectivity at a minimum and potentially other connectivity means.
Service and network control functions.
Interconnection (with other networks).
Roaming.
Different Core Networks offer different features sets.
Core Networks (CNs) include (but are not limited to) 3GPP CNs, ETSI
TISPAN CN and 3GPP2 CN.

M2M service capabilities:

Provide M2M functions that are to be shared by different applications.
Expose functions through a set of open interfaces.
Use core network functionalities.
Simplify and optimize application development and deployment through
hiding of network speciﬁcities.

M2M applications: Applications that run the service logic and use M2M

Service capabilities accessible via an open interface.

Interoperation among IoT Standards 259

Figure 7 ETSI Reference Architecture [15].

ETSI M2M architecture has following interface reference points [15].

Reference points are described below based on [15].
mIa Reference Point:
Allows a network application to access M2M service capabilities in the net-
work domain. The mIa reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation
[16].
dIa Reference Point:
Allows a device application residing in an M2M device to access the different
M2M service capabilities in the same M2M device or in an M2M gateway;
allows a gateway residing in an M2M gateway to access different M2M service
capabilities in the same M2M gateway. The dIa reference point shall comply
with speciﬁcation [16].
mId Reference Point:
Allows an M2M service capabilities residing in an M2M device or M2M
gateway to communicate with M2M service capabilities in network Domain
and vice versa. mId uses core network connectivity functions as an underlying
layer. The mId reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation [16].

2.2 GISFI IoT Architecture
In this section we present generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI –IoT- WG. The IoT reference architecture of GISFI follows conceptual
model presented in ﬁgure [6].

GISFI IoT reference architecture is partitioned into four layers namely
device layer, gateway layer, service platform layer and application layer.
Different layers are described in brief below following the GISFI – IoT-
contribution [6].

• IoT Device Layer
IoT devices are included in this layer. This layer consists of individual
sensors, network enabled objects and capillary networks consisting of data
sources that are near to the physical environment. It includes heterogeneous
devices (including sensors and actuators) supporting diverse communication
standards such as Zigbee, ZWave, ANTS andWi-Fi, etc.

• IoT Gateway Layer
This layer consists of IoT gateways. The substantial heterogeneity of de-
vices and technologies hosted by the device layer is abstracted using gateways

Interoperation among IoT Standards 261

that can provide more uniform interface to IoT service platform layer. It is also
possible that a capable device can implement both IoT device and gateway
layer/functionality into a single physical entity and connects to IoT service
platform layer through the core network.

• IoT Service Platform Layer
This deﬁnes and provides different IoT service abstractions that can be
used by multiple applications. There can be a set of platform services from the
IoT platform infrastructure. Further the same framework can be extended to
application services where some of the reusable application components are
available as services.

The physical entities involved in the above three layers need suitable
communication infrastructure for information exchange. While device layer
addresses this requirement using various legacy technologies which are out
of scope for this document, the gateway layer and service platform layer are
expected to be connected over an IoT Core / Backbone network. The IoT Core
is envisaged to be predominantly an IP based network and that is in line with
the vision of IoT. This IP connectivity could be supported over multitudes of
telecommunication infrastructures such as DSL, Cellular networks (2G, 3G,
4G) etc.

interfaces of these layers stated above.

• IoT Application Layer
This layer consists of different IoT applications.
GISFI IoT architecture has following interface reference points at the
• I1: Interface from device layer to gateway layer,
• I2: Interface from gateway layer to service platform layer through IoT
core network
• I3: Interface from service platform to layer speciﬁc vertical applications
Each of these interface points will beneﬁt from a standardized informa-
tion exchange because of the diversity of devices, manufacturers, service
providers, and service consumers involved. Each of these interface points
are expected to support a set of specialized capabilities which may form a
set of standardized adapters designed for purpose. These adapters may im-
plement existing protocols or needs new developments or extension based
on requirements gathered from various IoT use cases. Figure 9 shows the
GISFI IoT interfaces. Functionalities of these interfaces are summarized in
Table 1 [6].

2.3 ETSI and GISFI standard-organization comparison and

scope of their interoperation

This section presents scope of technical interoperation between ETSI and
GISFI standards.

Comparison of interfaces proposed by GISFI– IoT–WG and ETSI-M2M-
WG are presented in table 2 below based on the GISFI contribution [7]. M2M
and IoT reference architecture of ETSI and GISFI indicating interfaces are
presented in Figure 10.

Table 2 represents comparisons of interfaces of ETSI M2M and GISFI
IoT reference architecture. GISFI IoT architecture proposes three (I1, I2,

Capabilities
This is the reference interface between the IoT device and IoT gate-
way. I1 will accommodate co-existence of multiple legacy link level
and sensor network standards. A uniﬁed data interchange format
between sensors and gateway can be a focus here.
I1a is the interface that has the capability of handling the data path
between devices and gateway.
Device speciﬁc management functions such as sensor sampling
conﬁguration, security settings, device registration, device health
check, ﬁrmware upgrade etc will be done through this interface.
This is the reference interface between the IoTgateway and IoT-
service platform. Service platform is an application middleware
providing platform services to build domain speciﬁc applications.
This has a data path as well as management path. The connectivity
is provided using IoT Core Network which is predominantly any IP
capable core network infrastructure such as xDSL, 3GPP, 3GPP2.
It exchanges the data that includes various sensor observations,
aggregates from the IoTgateway to the IoT Service Platform.
This interface takes care of the gateway management func-
tions including security/authentication conﬁguration, ﬁrmware up-
gradation, application download, health monitoring etc.
This interface takes care of communication between gateways to
enable mobility, resilience, and scalability.
This interface provides a uniform access of various IoT services to
the domain speciﬁc vertical applications. The applications may run
at different physical entities but they need to have the IoT services
access from multiple service providers.
This interface exposes the access to various data services
This interface provides access to various management and adminis-
trative services. This includes user management, device registration,
storage management, IoT application store, access control, privacy
etc.
It enables IoT service platform to communicate with another IoT
service platform towards scalability and data exchange with peer
IoT systems.

dards support data and management functionalities. However I2c and I3c
deﬁned by GISFI support self-looping among similar gateways and service
platforms these functionalities are missing in reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI.

Technical-interoperability of IoT framework from different standards is
achievable as long as standards abide by the concept of three layered

architecture (sensor, core/backbone network, application/services) and con-
ceptual IoT architecture model depicted in ﬁgure 6. However semantic, syn-
tactic interoperability are achievable by performing mapping among different
groups (like mandatory, optional) of attributes of interfaces and different APIs
(application programming interface), out of scope of this article.

3 Conclusion

Establishing interoperation across various IoT reference architectures deﬁned
by different standard organizations speciﬁcally to make them technically in-
teroperable is explored in this document. The architectures consisting multiple
layers like sensors, core-network, service platform and applications possess
technical interoperability. We have elaborated architecture and functionalities
of reference interfaces proposed by GISFI. Elaboration of interfaces speciﬁed
in GISFI IoT reference architecture addressing major requirements of various
use-case scenarios is work in progress in that work group. We have compared
functionalities of proposed interfaces of reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI and GISFI. Establishing low overhead secured path with unique naming
and addressing mechanism is still an open area for standardization. We believe
bringing different standards semantically and syntactically interoperable by
addressing main requirements of IoT framework like diverse and distributed
computing environment, low overhead communication medium, support of
critical events, and human machine interaction is another research area and
candidate for standardization.

Abstract

This article presents generic IoT (Internet of Things) reference architecture
proposed by standard organization. It compares different IoT reference ar-
chitectures proposed by different standards institutes, specially emphasizing
lightweight requirements of IoT reference architecture. These architectures
deﬁne multiple interfaces. Functionalities of proposed interfaces are compared
here to enable an understanding regarding the scope of interoperation among
different IoT standards. Finally, future scopes for standardization in IoT are
presented.

Keywords: IoT, Standardization body, lightweight.

1 Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally network of networks with Internet
as backbone. It associates diverse sensors, actuators, computing system to
provide intelligent services to human society. It comprises sensing network
with different constrained sensors. These sensors detect environmental condi-
tion, send this sensing information to backend computing system over Internet.
Backend interprets sensed data, sometimes it is done by sensor/sensor-gateway

locally, takes decisions, and routs these decisions to local applications, actua-
tors or to other user devices like mobile phones which are also constrained in
nature.

[1] Discusses different visions of IoT. In [2] functionalities and compo-

nents of middleware for IoT architecture are presented.

Figure 1 depicts the said communication components of IoT. It is evident
from above ﬁgure that IoT architecture needs to address the limitations of
constrained network acting as networks of data producers as well as data
consumers.

The very purpose of IoT is to make things smart [14]. Different use cases

and technologies of IoT are depicted in Figure 2 below.

Diverse technologies, software, applications are building blocks of IoT.
Many standard organizations are putting effort to deﬁne IoT reference archi-
tecture emphasizing machine to machine (M2M) communication which is
pragmatic to deﬁne functional modules of IoT architecture.

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) [3], ITU-T (In-
ternational Telecommunication Union) [8], TIA (Telecommunications Indus-
try Association) [9], OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) [12], GISFI (Global ICT
Standardization Forum for India) [11], CCSA (China communication standard
association) [10], CASAGRAS (coordination and support action for global
RFID-related activities and standardization) are some examples of such stan-
dard organizations working on IoT and M2M communication. Figure 3 depicts
different standard bodies working in different areas and use-cases of IoT.

A state-of-the-art in M2M communications, in terms of standardization
bodies, research projects, protocols, etc. along with application programming
interfaces (API) for endpoints of IoT communication network is analyzed
in [13]. Figure 4 shows association among ETSI, OMA, TIA etc. Diversity
is key factor of IoT therefore interoperation is a major challenge to achieve
this diversity. Different categories of interoperability like semantic, syntactic,
technical and organizational are presented in [4]. Figure 5 represents different

levels of interoperation by considering technical interoperation as core of
interoperation.

Technical interoperability deﬁnes association with hardware/software, sys-
tems and platforms enabling M2M communication. This generally uses mainly
communication protocols and the infrastructure needed for those protocols to
operate [4].

Above stated facts clearly indicate that diversity is an inherent property
of IoT. The facts discussed above also indicate that there are 1) lack of com-
prehensive reference architectures, and 2) lack of technical interoperability
evaluation scopes. Therefore there is a need to address these gaps.

In this article we address the ﬁrst gap by presenting a conceptual model
of IoT, and also presenting a generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI standard body.

IoT reference architecture, its functional modules and interfaces deﬁned

aspects among said standard-bodies to address the second gap. None of above
literatures perform an extensive study in this regard.

2 IoT Reference Architecture

In this section we present conceptual model of IoT, and its reference architec-
ture proposed by different standard body. IoT architecture constitutes mainly
four layers like sensor or thing layer, network layer, service, and application
layer.

Both ETSI, and GISFI reference architecture for M2M and IoT support

this conceptual model. Figure 6 depicts the conceptual model of IoT.

2.1 ETSI Reference Architecture

ETSI high level reference architecture possesses two domains as stated below
[15].

1. The device and gateway Domain.

It is composed of the following elements:
M2M device: A device that runs M2M application(s) using M2M ser-
vice capabilities. M2M devices connect to network domain using a direct

connectivity, or using gateway as a network proxy. M2M devices may be
connected to the networks domain via multiple M2M gateways.

M2M area network: provides connectivity between M2M Devices and
M2M Gateways. Examples of M2M Area Networks include: Personal Area
Network technologies such as IEEE 802.15.1, Zigbee, Bluetooth, IETF ROLL,
etc. or local networks such as PLC, M-BUS, Wireless M-BUS and KNX.

M2M gateway: A gateway runs M2M Application(s) using M2M service
capabilities. The gateway acts as a proxy between M2M devices and the
network domain.

2. The network domain

It is composed of following elements:
Access network: Network which allows the M2M device and gateway
domain to communicate with the core network. Access Networks include
(but are not limited to): xDSL, HFC, satellite, GERAN, UTRAN, eUTRAN,
W-LAN and WiMAX.

Core network:
It provides following:

IPconnectivity at a minimum and potentially other connectivity means.
Service and network control functions.
Interconnection (with other networks).
Roaming.
Different Core Networks offer different features sets.
Core Networks (CNs) include (but are not limited to) 3GPP CNs, ETSI
TISPAN CN and 3GPP2 CN.

M2M service capabilities:

Provide M2M functions that are to be shared by different applications.
Expose functions through a set of open interfaces.
Use core network functionalities.
Simplify and optimize application development and deployment through
hiding of network speciﬁcities.

M2M applications: Applications that run the service logic and use M2M

Service capabilities accessible via an open interface.

Figure 7 ETSI Reference Architecture [15].

ETSI M2M architecture has following interface reference points [15].

Reference points are described below based on [15].
mIa Reference Point:
Allows a network application to access M2M service capabilities in the net-
work domain. The mIa reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation
[16].
dIa Reference Point:
Allows a device application residing in an M2M device to access the different
M2M service capabilities in the same M2M device or in an M2M gateway;
allows a gateway residing in an M2M gateway to access different M2M service
capabilities in the same M2M gateway. The dIa reference point shall comply
with speciﬁcation [16].
mId Reference Point:
Allows an M2M service capabilities residing in an M2M device or M2M
gateway to communicate with M2M service capabilities in network Domain
and vice versa. mId uses core network connectivity functions as an underlying
layer. The mId reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation [16].

2.2 GISFI IoT Architecture
In this section we present generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI –IoT- WG. The IoT reference architecture of GISFI follows conceptual
model presented in ﬁgure [6].

GISFI IoT reference architecture is partitioned into four layers namely
device layer, gateway layer, service platform layer and application layer.
Different layers are described in brief below following the GISFI – IoT-
contribution [6].

• IoT Device Layer
IoT devices are included in this layer. This layer consists of individual
sensors, network enabled objects and capillary networks consisting of data
sources that are near to the physical environment. It includes heterogeneous
devices (including sensors and actuators) supporting diverse communication
standards such as Zigbee, ZWave, ANTS andWi-Fi, etc.

• IoT Gateway Layer
This layer consists of IoT gateways. The substantial heterogeneity of de-
vices and technologies hosted by the device layer is abstracted using gateways

Interoperation among IoT Standards 261

that can provide more uniform interface to IoT service platform layer. It is also
possible that a capable device can implement both IoT device and gateway
layer/functionality into a single physical entity and connects to IoT service
platform layer through the core network.

• IoT Service Platform Layer
This deﬁnes and provides different IoT service abstractions that can be
used by multiple applications. There can be a set of platform services from the
IoT platform infrastructure. Further the same framework can be extended to
application services where some of the reusable application components are
available as services.

The physical entities involved in the above three layers need suitable
communication infrastructure for information exchange. While device layer
addresses this requirement using various legacy technologies which are out
of scope for this document, the gateway layer and service platform layer are
expected to be connected over an IoT Core / Backbone network. The IoT Core
is envisaged to be predominantly an IP based network and that is in line with
the vision of IoT. This IP connectivity could be supported over multitudes of
telecommunication infrastructures such as DSL, Cellular networks (2G, 3G,
4G) etc.

interfaces of these layers stated above.

• IoT Application Layer
This layer consists of different IoT applications.
GISFI IoT architecture has following interface reference points at the
• I1: Interface from device layer to gateway layer,
• I2: Interface from gateway layer to service platform layer through IoT
core network
• I3: Interface from service platform to layer speciﬁc vertical applications
Each of these interface points will beneﬁt from a standardized informa-
tion exchange because of the diversity of devices, manufacturers, service
providers, and service consumers involved. Each of these interface points
are expected to support a set of specialized capabilities which may form a
set of standardized adapters designed for purpose. These adapters may im-
plement existing protocols or needs new developments or extension based
on requirements gathered from various IoT use cases. Figure 9 shows the
GISFI IoT interfaces. Functionalities of these interfaces are summarized in
Table 1 [6].

2.3 ETSI and GISFI standard-organization comparison and

scope of their interoperation

This section presents scope of technical interoperation between ETSI and
GISFI standards.

Comparison of interfaces proposed by GISFI– IoT–WG and ETSI-M2M-
WG are presented in table 2 below based on the GISFI contribution [7]. M2M
and IoT reference architecture of ETSI and GISFI indicating interfaces are
presented in Figure 10.

Table 2 represents comparisons of interfaces of ETSI M2M and GISFI
IoT reference architecture. GISFI IoT architecture proposes three (I1, I2,

Capabilities
This is the reference interface between the IoT device and IoT gate-
way. I1 will accommodate co-existence of multiple legacy link level
and sensor network standards. A uniﬁed data interchange format
between sensors and gateway can be a focus here.
I1a is the interface that has the capability of handling the data path
between devices and gateway.
Device speciﬁc management functions such as sensor sampling
conﬁguration, security settings, device registration, device health
check, ﬁrmware upgrade etc will be done through this interface.
This is the reference interface between the IoTgateway and IoT-
service platform. Service platform is an application middleware
providing platform services to build domain speciﬁc applications.
This has a data path as well as management path. The connectivity
is provided using IoT Core Network which is predominantly any IP
capable core network infrastructure such as xDSL, 3GPP, 3GPP2.
It exchanges the data that includes various sensor observations,
aggregates from the IoTgateway to the IoT Service Platform.
This interface takes care of the gateway management func-
tions including security/authentication conﬁguration, ﬁrmware up-
gradation, application download, health monitoring etc.
This interface takes care of communication between gateways to
enable mobility, resilience, and scalability.
This interface provides a uniform access of various IoT services to
the domain speciﬁc vertical applications. The applications may run
at different physical entities but they need to have the IoT services
access from multiple service providers.
This interface exposes the access to various data services
This interface provides access to various management and adminis-
trative services. This includes user management, device registration,
storage management, IoT application store, access control, privacy
etc.
It enables IoT service platform to communicate with another IoT
service platform towards scalability and data exchange with peer
IoT systems.

dards support data and management functionalities. However I2c and I3c
deﬁned by GISFI support self-looping among similar gateways and service
platforms these functionalities are missing in reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI.

Technical-interoperability of IoT framework from different standards is
achievable as long as standards abide by the concept of three layered

architecture (sensor, core/backbone network, application/services) and con-
ceptual IoT architecture model depicted in ﬁgure 6. However semantic, syn-
tactic interoperability are achievable by performing mapping among different
groups (like mandatory, optional) of attributes of interfaces and different APIs
(application programming interface), out of scope of this article.

3 Conclusion

Establishing interoperation across various IoT reference architectures deﬁned
by different standard organizations speciﬁcally to make them technically in-
teroperable is explored in this document. The architectures consisting multiple
layers like sensors, core-network, service platform and applications possess
technical interoperability. We have elaborated architecture and functionalities
of reference interfaces proposed by GISFI. Elaboration of interfaces speciﬁed
in GISFI IoT reference architecture addressing major requirements of various
use-case scenarios is work in progress in that work group. We have compared
functionalities of proposed interfaces of reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI and GISFI. Establishing low overhead secured path with unique naming
and addressing mechanism is still an open area for standardization. We believe
bringing different standards semantically and syntactically interoperable by
addressing main requirements of IoT framework like diverse and distributed
computing environment, low overhead communication medium, support of
critical events, and human machine interaction is another research area and
candidate for standardization.

Abstract

This article presents generic IoT (Internet of Things) reference architecture
proposed by standard organization. It compares different IoT reference ar-
chitectures proposed by different standards institutes, specially emphasizing
lightweight requirements of IoT reference architecture. These architectures
deﬁne multiple interfaces. Functionalities of proposed interfaces are compared
here to enable an understanding regarding the scope of interoperation among
different IoT standards. Finally, future scopes for standardization in IoT are
presented.

Keywords: IoT, Standardization body, lightweight.

1 Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally network of networks with Internet
as backbone. It associates diverse sensors, actuators, computing system to
provide intelligent services to human society. It comprises sensing network
with different constrained sensors. These sensors detect environmental condi-
tion, send this sensing information to backend computing system over Internet.
Backend interprets sensed data, sometimes it is done by sensor/sensor-gateway

locally, takes decisions, and routs these decisions to local applications, actua-
tors or to other user devices like mobile phones which are also constrained in
nature.

[1] Discusses different visions of IoT. In [2] functionalities and compo-

nents of middleware for IoT architecture are presented.

Figure 1 depicts the said communication components of IoT. It is evident
from above ﬁgure that IoT architecture needs to address the limitations of
constrained network acting as networks of data producers as well as data
consumers.

The very purpose of IoT is to make things smart [14]. Different use cases

and technologies of IoT are depicted in Figure 2 below.

Diverse technologies, software, applications are building blocks of IoT.
Many standard organizations are putting effort to deﬁne IoT reference archi-
tecture emphasizing machine to machine (M2M) communication which is
pragmatic to deﬁne functional modules of IoT architecture.

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) [3], ITU-T (In-
ternational Telecommunication Union) [8], TIA (Telecommunications Indus-
try Association) [9], OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) [12], GISFI (Global ICT
Standardization Forum for India) [11], CCSA (China communication standard
association) [10], CASAGRAS (coordination and support action for global
RFID-related activities and standardization) are some examples of such stan-
dard organizations working on IoT and M2M communication. Figure 3 depicts
different standard bodies working in different areas and use-cases of IoT.

A state-of-the-art in M2M communications, in terms of standardization
bodies, research projects, protocols, etc. along with application programming
interfaces (API) for endpoints of IoT communication network is analyzed
in [13]. Figure 4 shows association among ETSI, OMA, TIA etc. Diversity
is key factor of IoT therefore interoperation is a major challenge to achieve
this diversity. Different categories of interoperability like semantic, syntactic,
technical and organizational are presented in [4]. Figure 5 represents different

levels of interoperation by considering technical interoperation as core of
interoperation.

Technical interoperability deﬁnes association with hardware/software, sys-
tems and platforms enabling M2M communication. This generally uses mainly
communication protocols and the infrastructure needed for those protocols to
operate [4].

Above stated facts clearly indicate that diversity is an inherent property
of IoT. The facts discussed above also indicate that there are 1) lack of com-
prehensive reference architectures, and 2) lack of technical interoperability
evaluation scopes. Therefore there is a need to address these gaps.

In this article we address the ﬁrst gap by presenting a conceptual model
of IoT, and also presenting a generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI standard body.

IoT reference architecture, its functional modules and interfaces deﬁned
by different standard bodies mainly ETSI and GISFI are compared here. Fur-
ther based on these comparisons we discuss scope of technical interoperation

Interoperation among IoT Standards 257

aspects among said standard-bodies to address the second gap. None of above
literatures perform an extensive study in this regard.

2 IoT Reference Architecture

In this section we present conceptual model of IoT, and its reference architec-
ture proposed by different standard body. IoT architecture constitutes mainly
four layers like sensor or thing layer, network layer, service, and application
layer.

Both ETSI, and GISFI reference architecture for M2M and IoT support

this conceptual model. Figure 6 depicts the conceptual model of IoT.

2.1 ETSI Reference Architecture

ETSI high level reference architecture possesses two domains as stated below
[15].

1. The device and gateway Domain.

It is composed of the following elements:
M2M device: A device that runs M2M application(s) using M2M ser-
vice capabilities. M2M devices connect to network domain using a direct

258 S. Bandyopadhyay, P. Balamuralidhar and Arpan Pal

connectivity, or using gateway as a network proxy. M2M devices may be
connected to the networks domain via multiple M2M gateways.

M2M area network: provides connectivity between M2M Devices and
M2M Gateways. Examples of M2M Area Networks include: Personal Area
Network technologies such as IEEE 802.15.1, Zigbee, Bluetooth, IETF ROLL,
etc. or local networks such as PLC, M-BUS, Wireless M-BUS and KNX.

M2M gateway: A gateway runs M2M Application(s) using M2M service
capabilities. The gateway acts as a proxy between M2M devices and the
network domain.

2. The network domain

It is composed of following elements:
Access network: Network which allows the M2M device and gateway
domain to communicate with the core network. Access Networks include
(but are not limited to): xDSL, HFC, satellite, GERAN, UTRAN, eUTRAN,
W-LAN and WiMAX.

Core network:
It provides following:

IPconnectivity at a minimum and potentially other connectivity means.
Service and network control functions.
Interconnection (with other networks).
Roaming.
Different Core Networks offer different features sets.
Core Networks (CNs) include (but are not limited to) 3GPP CNs, ETSI
TISPAN CN and 3GPP2 CN.

M2M service capabilities:

Provide M2M functions that are to be shared by different applications.
Expose functions through a set of open interfaces.
Use core network functionalities.
Simplify and optimize application development and deployment through
hiding of network speciﬁcities.

M2M applications: Applications that run the service logic and use M2M

Service capabilities accessible via an open interface.

Figure 7 ETSI Reference Architecture [15].

ETSI M2M architecture has following interface reference points [15].

Reference points are described below based on [15].
mIa Reference Point:
Allows a network application to access M2M service capabilities in the net-
work domain. The mIa reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation
[16].
dIa Reference Point:
Allows a device application residing in an M2M device to access the different
M2M service capabilities in the same M2M device or in an M2M gateway;
allows a gateway residing in an M2M gateway to access different M2M service
capabilities in the same M2M gateway. The dIa reference point shall comply
with speciﬁcation [16].
mId Reference Point:
Allows an M2M service capabilities residing in an M2M device or M2M
gateway to communicate with M2M service capabilities in network Domain
and vice versa. mId uses core network connectivity functions as an underlying
layer. The mId reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation [16].

Figure 8 represents interfaces mIa, mId and dIa deﬁned by ETSI.

2.2 GISFI IoT Architecture
In this section we present generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI –IoT- WG. The IoT reference architecture of GISFI follows conceptual
model presented in ﬁgure [6].

GISFI IoT reference architecture is partitioned into four layers namely
device layer, gateway layer, service platform layer and application layer.
Different layers are described in brief below following the GISFI – IoT-
contribution [6].

• IoT Device Layer
IoT devices are included in this layer. This layer consists of individual
sensors, network enabled objects and capillary networks consisting of data
sources that are near to the physical environment. It includes heterogeneous
devices (including sensors and actuators) supporting diverse communication
standards such as Zigbee, ZWave, ANTS andWi-Fi, etc.

• IoT Gateway Layer
This layer consists of IoT gateways. The substantial heterogeneity of de-
vices and technologies hosted by the device layer is abstracted using gateways

Interoperation among IoT Standards 261

that can provide more uniform interface to IoT service platform layer. It is also
possible that a capable device can implement both IoT device and gateway
layer/functionality into a single physical entity and connects to IoT service
platform layer through the core network.

• IoT Service Platform Layer
This deﬁnes and provides different IoT service abstractions that can be
used by multiple applications. There can be a set of platform services from the
IoT platform infrastructure. Further the same framework can be extended to
application services where some of the reusable application components are
available as services.

The physical entities involved in the above three layers need suitable
communication infrastructure for information exchange. While device layer
addresses this requirement using various legacy technologies which are out
of scope for this document, the gateway layer and service platform layer are
expected to be connected over an IoT Core / Backbone network. The IoT Core
is envisaged to be predominantly an IP based network and that is in line with
the vision of IoT. This IP connectivity could be supported over multitudes of
telecommunication infrastructures such as DSL, Cellular networks (2G, 3G,
4G) etc.

interfaces of these layers stated above.

• IoT Application Layer
This layer consists of different IoT applications.
GISFI IoT architecture has following interface reference points at the
• I1: Interface from device layer to gateway layer,
• I2: Interface from gateway layer to service platform layer through IoT
core network
• I3: Interface from service platform to layer speciﬁc vertical applications
Each of these interface points will beneﬁt from a standardized informa-
tion exchange because of the diversity of devices, manufacturers, service
providers, and service consumers involved. Each of these interface points
are expected to support a set of specialized capabilities which may form a
set of standardized adapters designed for purpose. These adapters may im-
plement existing protocols or needs new developments or extension based
on requirements gathered from various IoT use cases. Figure 9 shows the
GISFI IoT interfaces. Functionalities of these interfaces are summarized in
Table 1 [6].

2.3 ETSI and GISFI standard-organization comparison and

scope of their interoperation

This section presents scope of technical interoperation between ETSI and
GISFI standards.

Comparison of interfaces proposed by GISFI– IoT–WG and ETSI-M2M-
WG are presented in table 2 below based on the GISFI contribution [7]. M2M
and IoT reference architecture of ETSI and GISFI indicating interfaces are
presented in Figure 10.

Table 2 represents comparisons of interfaces of ETSI M2M and GISFI
IoT reference architecture. GISFI IoT architecture proposes three (I1, I2,

Capabilities
This is the reference interface between the IoT device and IoT gate-
way. I1 will accommodate co-existence of multiple legacy link level
and sensor network standards. A uniﬁed data interchange format
between sensors and gateway can be a focus here.
I1a is the interface that has the capability of handling the data path
between devices and gateway.
Device speciﬁc management functions such as sensor sampling
conﬁguration, security settings, device registration, device health
check, ﬁrmware upgrade etc will be done through this interface.
This is the reference interface between the IoTgateway and IoT-
service platform. Service platform is an application middleware
providing platform services to build domain speciﬁc applications.
This has a data path as well as management path. The connectivity
is provided using IoT Core Network which is predominantly any IP
capable core network infrastructure such as xDSL, 3GPP, 3GPP2.
It exchanges the data that includes various sensor observations,
aggregates from the IoTgateway to the IoT Service Platform.
This interface takes care of the gateway management func-
tions including security/authentication conﬁguration, ﬁrmware up-
gradation, application download, health monitoring etc.
This interface takes care of communication between gateways to
enable mobility, resilience, and scalability.
This interface provides a uniform access of various IoT services to
the domain speciﬁc vertical applications. The applications may run
at different physical entities but they need to have the IoT services
access from multiple service providers.
This interface exposes the access to various data services
This interface provides access to various management and adminis-
trative services. This includes user management, device registration,
storage management, IoT application store, access control, privacy
etc.
It enables IoT service platform to communicate with another IoT
service platform towards scalability and data exchange with peer
IoT systems.

dards support data and management functionalities. However I2c and I3c
deﬁned by GISFI support self-looping among similar gateways and service
platforms these functionalities are missing in reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI.

Technical-interoperability of IoT framework from different standards is
achievable as long as standards abide by the concept of three layered

architecture (sensor, core/backbone network, application/services) and con-
ceptual IoT architecture model depicted in ﬁgure 6. However semantic, syn-
tactic interoperability are achievable by performing mapping among different
groups (like mandatory, optional) of attributes of interfaces and different APIs
(application programming interface), out of scope of this article.

3 Conclusion

Establishing interoperation across various IoT reference architectures deﬁned
by different standard organizations speciﬁcally to make them technically in-
teroperable is explored in this document. The architectures consisting multiple
layers like sensors, core-network, service platform and applications possess
technical interoperability. We have elaborated architecture and functionalities
of reference interfaces proposed by GISFI. Elaboration of interfaces speciﬁed
in GISFI IoT reference architecture addressing major requirements of various
use-case scenarios is work in progress in that work group. We have compared
functionalities of proposed interfaces of reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI and GISFI. Establishing low overhead secured path with unique naming
and addressing mechanism is still an open area for standardization. We believe
bringing different standards semantically and syntactically interoperable by
addressing main requirements of IoT framework like diverse and distributed
computing environment, low overhead communication medium, support of
critical events, and human machine interaction is another research area and
candidate for standardization.

Abstract

This article presents generic IoT (Internet of Things) reference architecture
proposed by standard organization. It compares different IoT reference ar-
chitectures proposed by different standards institutes, specially emphasizing
lightweight requirements of IoT reference architecture. These architectures
deﬁne multiple interfaces. Functionalities of proposed interfaces are compared
here to enable an understanding regarding the scope of interoperation among
different IoT standards. Finally, future scopes for standardization in IoT are
presented.

Keywords: IoT, Standardization body, lightweight.

1 Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally network of networks with Internet
as backbone. It associates diverse sensors, actuators, computing system to
provide intelligent services to human society. It comprises sensing network
with different constrained sensors. These sensors detect environmental condi-
tion, send this sensing information to backend computing system over Internet.
Backend interprets sensed data, sometimes it is done by sensor/sensor-gateway

locally, takes decisions, and routs these decisions to local applications, actua-
tors or to other user devices like mobile phones which are also constrained in
nature.

[1] Discusses different visions of IoT. In [2] functionalities and compo-

nents of middleware for IoT architecture are presented.

Figure 1 depicts the said communication components of IoT. It is evident
from above ﬁgure that IoT architecture needs to address the limitations of
constrained network acting as networks of data producers as well as data
consumers.

The very purpose of IoT is to make things smart [14]. Different use cases

and technologies of IoT are depicted in Figure 2 below.

Diverse technologies, software, applications are building blocks of IoT.
Many standard organizations are putting effort to deﬁne IoT reference archi-
tecture emphasizing machine to machine (M2M) communication which is
pragmatic to deﬁne functional modules of IoT architecture.

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) [3], ITU-T (In-
ternational Telecommunication Union) [8], TIA (Telecommunications Indus-
try Association) [9], OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) [12], GISFI (Global ICT
Standardization Forum for India) [11], CCSA (China communication standard
association) [10], CASAGRAS (coordination and support action for global
RFID-related activities and standardization) are some examples of such stan-
dard organizations working on IoT and M2M communication. Figure 3 depicts
different standard bodies working in different areas and use-cases of IoT.

A state-of-the-art in M2M communications, in terms of standardization
bodies, research projects, protocols, etc. along with application programming
interfaces (API) for endpoints of IoT communication network is analyzed
in [13]. Figure 4 shows association among ETSI, OMA, TIA etc. Diversity
is key factor of IoT therefore interoperation is a major challenge to achieve
this diversity. Different categories of interoperability like semantic, syntactic,
technical and organizational are presented in [4]. Figure 5 represents different

levels of interoperation by considering technical interoperation as core of
interoperation.

Technical interoperability deﬁnes association with hardware/software, sys-
tems and platforms enabling M2M communication. This generally uses mainly
communication protocols and the infrastructure needed for those protocols to
operate [4].

Above stated facts clearly indicate that diversity is an inherent property
of IoT. The facts discussed above also indicate that there are 1) lack of com-
prehensive reference architectures, and 2) lack of technical interoperability
evaluation scopes. Therefore there is a need to address these gaps.

In this article we address the ﬁrst gap by presenting a conceptual model
of IoT, and also presenting a generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI standard body.

IoT reference architecture, its functional modules and interfaces deﬁned
by different standard bodies mainly ETSI and GISFI are compared here. Fur-
ther based on these comparisons we discuss scope of technical interoperation

Interoperation among IoT Standards 257

aspects among said standard-bodies to address the second gap. None of above
literatures perform an extensive study in this regard.

2 IoT Reference Architecture

In this section we present conceptual model of IoT, and its reference architec-
ture proposed by different standard body. IoT architecture constitutes mainly
four layers like sensor or thing layer, network layer, service, and application
layer.

Both ETSI, and GISFI reference architecture for M2M and IoT support

this conceptual model. Figure 6 depicts the conceptual model of IoT.

2.1 ETSI Reference Architecture

ETSI high level reference architecture possesses two domains as stated below
[15].

1. The device and gateway Domain.

It is composed of the following elements:
M2M device: A device that runs M2M application(s) using M2M ser-
vice capabilities. M2M devices connect to network domain using a direct

connectivity, or using gateway as a network proxy. M2M devices may be
connected to the networks domain via multiple M2M gateways.

M2M area network: provides connectivity between M2M Devices and
M2M Gateways. Examples of M2M Area Networks include: Personal Area
Network technologies such as IEEE 802.15.1, Zigbee, Bluetooth, IETF ROLL,
etc. or local networks such as PLC, M-BUS, Wireless M-BUS and KNX.

M2M gateway: A gateway runs M2M Application(s) using M2M service
capabilities. The gateway acts as a proxy between M2M devices and the
network domain.

2. The network domain

It is composed of following elements:
Access network: Network which allows the M2M device and gateway
domain to communicate with the core network. Access Networks include
(but are not limited to): xDSL, HFC, satellite, GERAN, UTRAN, eUTRAN,
W-LAN and WiMAX.

Core network:
It provides following:

IPconnectivity at a minimum and potentially other connectivity means.
Service and network control functions.
Interconnection (with other networks).
Roaming.
Different Core Networks offer different features sets.
Core Networks (CNs) include (but are not limited to) 3GPP CNs, ETSI
TISPAN CN and 3GPP2 CN.

M2M service capabilities:

Provide M2M functions that are to be shared by different applications.
Expose functions through a set of open interfaces.
Use core network functionalities.
Simplify and optimize application development and deployment through
hiding of network speciﬁcities.

M2M applications: Applications that run the service logic and use M2M

Service capabilities accessible via an open interface.

Figure 7 ETSI Reference Architecture [15].

ETSI M2M architecture has following interface reference points [15].

Reference points are described below based on [15].
mIa Reference Point:
Allows a network application to access M2M service capabilities in the net-
work domain. The mIa reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation
[16].
dIa Reference Point:
Allows a device application residing in an M2M device to access the different
M2M service capabilities in the same M2M device or in an M2M gateway;
allows a gateway residing in an M2M gateway to access different M2M service
capabilities in the same M2M gateway. The dIa reference point shall comply
with speciﬁcation [16].
mId Reference Point:
Allows an M2M service capabilities residing in an M2M device or M2M
gateway to communicate with M2M service capabilities in network Domain
and vice versa. mId uses core network connectivity functions as an underlying
layer. The mId reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation [16].

2.2 GISFI IoT Architecture
In this section we present generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI –IoT- WG. The IoT reference architecture of GISFI follows conceptual
model presented in ﬁgure [6].

GISFI IoT reference architecture is partitioned into four layers namely
device layer, gateway layer, service platform layer and application layer.
Different layers are described in brief below following the GISFI – IoT-
contribution [6].

• IoT Device Layer
IoT devices are included in this layer. This layer consists of individual
sensors, network enabled objects and capillary networks consisting of data
sources that are near to the physical environment. It includes heterogeneous
devices (including sensors and actuators) supporting diverse communication
standards such as Zigbee, ZWave, ANTS andWi-Fi, etc.

• IoT Gateway Layer
This layer consists of IoT gateways. The substantial heterogeneity of de-
vices and technologies hosted by the device layer is abstracted using gateways

Interoperation among IoT Standards 261

that can provide more uniform interface to IoT service platform layer. It is also
possible that a capable device can implement both IoT device and gateway
layer/functionality into a single physical entity and connects to IoT service
platform layer through the core network.

• IoT Service Platform Layer
This deﬁnes and provides different IoT service abstractions that can be
used by multiple applications. There can be a set of platform services from the
IoT platform infrastructure. Further the same framework can be extended to
application services where some of the reusable application components are
available as services.

The physical entities involved in the above three layers need suitable
communication infrastructure for information exchange. While device layer
addresses this requirement using various legacy technologies which are out
of scope for this document, the gateway layer and service platform layer are
expected to be connected over an IoT Core / Backbone network. The IoT Core
is envisaged to be predominantly an IP based network and that is in line with
the vision of IoT. This IP connectivity could be supported over multitudes of
telecommunication infrastructures such as DSL, Cellular networks (2G, 3G,
4G) etc.

interfaces of these layers stated above.

• IoT Application Layer
This layer consists of different IoT applications.
GISFI IoT architecture has following interface reference points at the
• I1: Interface from device layer to gateway layer,
• I2: Interface from gateway layer to service platform layer through IoT
core network
• I3: Interface from service platform to layer speciﬁc vertical applications
Each of these interface points will beneﬁt from a standardized informa-
tion exchange because of the diversity of devices, manufacturers, service
providers, and service consumers involved. Each of these interface points
are expected to support a set of specialized capabilities which may form a
set of standardized adapters designed for purpose. These adapters may im-
plement existing protocols or needs new developments or extension based
on requirements gathered from various IoT use cases. Figure 9 shows the
GISFI IoT interfaces. Functionalities of these interfaces are summarized in
Table 1 [6].

2.3 ETSI and GISFI standard-organization comparison and

scope of their interoperation

This section presents scope of technical interoperation between ETSI and
GISFI standards.

Comparison of interfaces proposed by GISFI– IoT–WG and ETSI-M2M-
WG are presented in table 2 below based on the GISFI contribution [7]. M2M
and IoT reference architecture of ETSI and GISFI indicating interfaces are
presented in Figure 10.

Table 2 represents comparisons of interfaces of ETSI M2M and GISFI
IoT reference architecture. GISFI IoT architecture proposes three (I1, I2,

Capabilities
This is the reference interface between the IoT device and IoT gate-
way. I1 will accommodate co-existence of multiple legacy link level
and sensor network standards. A uniﬁed data interchange format
between sensors and gateway can be a focus here.
I1a is the interface that has the capability of handling the data path
between devices and gateway.
Device speciﬁc management functions such as sensor sampling
conﬁguration, security settings, device registration, device health
check, ﬁrmware upgrade etc will be done through this interface.
This is the reference interface between the IoTgateway and IoT-
service platform. Service platform is an application middleware
providing platform services to build domain speciﬁc applications.
This has a data path as well as management path. The connectivity
is provided using IoT Core Network which is predominantly any IP
capable core network infrastructure such as xDSL, 3GPP, 3GPP2.
It exchanges the data that includes various sensor observations,
aggregates from the IoTgateway to the IoT Service Platform.
This interface takes care of the gateway management func-
tions including security/authentication conﬁguration, ﬁrmware up-
gradation, application download, health monitoring etc.
This interface takes care of communication between gateways to
enable mobility, resilience, and scalability.
This interface provides a uniform access of various IoT services to
the domain speciﬁc vertical applications. The applications may run
at different physical entities but they need to have the IoT services
access from multiple service providers.
This interface exposes the access to various data services
This interface provides access to various management and adminis-
trative services. This includes user management, device registration,
storage management, IoT application store, access control, privacy
etc.
It enables IoT service platform to communicate with another IoT
service platform towards scalability and data exchange with peer
IoT systems.

dards support data and management functionalities. However I2c and I3c
deﬁned by GISFI support self-looping among similar gateways and service
platforms these functionalities are missing in reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI.

Technical-interoperability of IoT framework from different standards is
achievable as long as standards abide by the concept of three layered

architecture (sensor, core/backbone network, application/services) and con-
ceptual IoT architecture model depicted in ﬁgure 6. However semantic, syn-
tactic interoperability are achievable by performing mapping among different
groups (like mandatory, optional) of attributes of interfaces and different APIs
(application programming interface), out of scope of this article.

3 Conclusion

Establishing interoperation across various IoT reference architectures deﬁned
by different standard organizations speciﬁcally to make them technically in-
teroperable is explored in this document. The architectures consisting multiple
layers like sensors, core-network, service platform and applications possess
technical interoperability. We have elaborated architecture and functionalities
of reference interfaces proposed by GISFI. Elaboration of interfaces speciﬁed
in GISFI IoT reference architecture addressing major requirements of various
use-case scenarios is work in progress in that work group. We have compared
functionalities of proposed interfaces of reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI and GISFI. Establishing low overhead secured path with unique naming
and addressing mechanism is still an open area for standardization. We believe
bringing different standards semantically and syntactically interoperable by
addressing main requirements of IoT framework like diverse and distributed
computing environment, low overhead communication medium, support of
critical events, and human machine interaction is another research area and
candidate for standardization.

Abstract

This article presents generic IoT (Internet of Things) reference architecture
proposed by standard organization. It compares different IoT reference ar-
chitectures proposed by different standards institutes, specially emphasizing
lightweight requirements of IoT reference architecture. These architectures
deﬁne multiple interfaces. Functionalities of proposed interfaces are compared
here to enable an understanding regarding the scope of interoperation among
different IoT standards. Finally, future scopes for standardization in IoT are
presented.

Keywords: IoT, Standardization body, lightweight.

1 Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) is fundamentally network of networks with Internet
as backbone. It associates diverse sensors, actuators, computing system to
provide intelligent services to human society. It comprises sensing network
with different constrained sensors. These sensors detect environmental condi-
tion, send this sensing information to backend computing system over Internet.
Backend interprets sensed data, sometimes it is done by sensor/sensor-gateway

locally, takes decisions, and routs these decisions to local applications, actua-
tors or to other user devices like mobile phones which are also constrained in
nature.

[1] Discusses different visions of IoT. In [2] functionalities and compo-

nents of middleware for IoT architecture are presented.

Figure 1 depicts the said communication components of IoT. It is evident
from above ﬁgure that IoT architecture needs to address the limitations of
constrained network acting as networks of data producers as well as data
consumers.

The very purpose of IoT is to make things smart [14]. Different use cases

and technologies of IoT are depicted in Figure 2 below.

Diverse technologies, software, applications are building blocks of IoT.
Many standard organizations are putting effort to deﬁne IoT reference archi-
tecture emphasizing machine to machine (M2M) communication which is
pragmatic to deﬁne functional modules of IoT architecture.

ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) [3], ITU-T (In-
ternational Telecommunication Union) [8], TIA (Telecommunications Indus-
try Association) [9], OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) [12], GISFI (Global ICT
Standardization Forum for India) [11], CCSA (China communication standard
association) [10], CASAGRAS (coordination and support action for global
RFID-related activities and standardization) are some examples of such stan-
dard organizations working on IoT and M2M communication. Figure 3 depicts
different standard bodies working in different areas and use-cases of IoT.

A state-of-the-art in M2M communications, in terms of standardization
bodies, research projects, protocols, etc. along with application programming
interfaces (API) for endpoints of IoT communication network is analyzed
in [13]. Figure 4 shows association among ETSI, OMA, TIA etc. Diversity
is key factor of IoT therefore interoperation is a major challenge to achieve
this diversity. Different categories of interoperability like semantic, syntactic,
technical and organizational are presented in [4]. Figure 5 represents different

levels of interoperation by considering technical interoperation as core of
interoperation.

Technical interoperability deﬁnes association with hardware/software, sys-
tems and platforms enabling M2M communication. This generally uses mainly
communication protocols and the infrastructure needed for those protocols to
operate [4].

Above stated facts clearly indicate that diversity is an inherent property
of IoT. The facts discussed above also indicate that there are 1) lack of com-
prehensive reference architectures, and 2) lack of technical interoperability
evaluation scopes. Therefore there is a need to address these gaps.

In this article we address the ﬁrst gap by presenting a conceptual model
of IoT, and also presenting a generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI standard body.

IoT reference architecture, its functional modules and interfaces deﬁned
by different standard bodies mainly ETSI and GISFI are compared here. Fur-
ther based on these comparisons we discuss scope of technical interoperation

Interoperation among IoT Standards 257

aspects among said standard-bodies to address the second gap. None of above
literatures perform an extensive study in this regard.

2 IoT Reference Architecture

In this section we present conceptual model of IoT, and its reference architec-
ture proposed by different standard body. IoT architecture constitutes mainly
four layers like sensor or thing layer, network layer, service, and application
layer.

Both ETSI, and GISFI reference architecture for M2M and IoT support

this conceptual model. Figure 6 depicts the conceptual model of IoT.

2.1 ETSI Reference Architecture

ETSI high level reference architecture possesses two domains as stated below
[15].

1. The device and gateway Domain.

It is composed of the following elements:
M2M device: A device that runs M2M application(s) using M2M ser-
vice capabilities. M2M devices connect to network domain using a direct

258 S. Bandyopadhyay, P. Balamuralidhar and Arpan Pal

connectivity, or using gateway as a network proxy. M2M devices may be
connected to the networks domain via multiple M2M gateways.

M2M area network: provides connectivity between M2M Devices and
M2M Gateways. Examples of M2M Area Networks include: Personal Area
Network technologies such as IEEE 802.15.1, Zigbee, Bluetooth, IETF ROLL,
etc. or local networks such as PLC, M-BUS, Wireless M-BUS and KNX.

M2M gateway: A gateway runs M2M Application(s) using M2M service
capabilities. The gateway acts as a proxy between M2M devices and the
network domain.

2. The network domain

It is composed of following elements:
Access network: Network which allows the M2M device and gateway
domain to communicate with the core network. Access Networks include
(but are not limited to): xDSL, HFC, satellite, GERAN, UTRAN, eUTRAN,
W-LAN and WiMAX.

Core network:
It provides following:

IPconnectivity at a minimum and potentially other connectivity means.
Service and network control functions.
Interconnection (with other networks).
Roaming.
Different Core Networks offer different features sets.
Core Networks (CNs) include (but are not limited to) 3GPP CNs, ETSI
TISPAN CN and 3GPP2 CN.

M2M service capabilities:

Provide M2M functions that are to be shared by different applications.
Expose functions through a set of open interfaces.
Use core network functionalities.
Simplify and optimize application development and deployment through
hiding of network speciﬁcities.

M2M applications: Applications that run the service logic and use M2M

Service capabilities accessible via an open interface.

Figure 7 ETSI Reference Architecture [15].

ETSI M2M architecture has following interface reference points [15].

Reference points are described below based on [15].
mIa Reference Point:
Allows a network application to access M2M service capabilities in the net-
work domain. The mIa reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation
[16].
dIa Reference Point:
Allows a device application residing in an M2M device to access the different
M2M service capabilities in the same M2M device or in an M2M gateway;
allows a gateway residing in an M2M gateway to access different M2M service
capabilities in the same M2M gateway. The dIa reference point shall comply
with speciﬁcation [16].
mId Reference Point:
Allows an M2M service capabilities residing in an M2M device or M2M
gateway to communicate with M2M service capabilities in network Domain
and vice versa. mId uses core network connectivity functions as an underlying
layer. The mId reference point shall comply with the speciﬁcation [16].

2.2 GISFI IoT Architecture
In this section we present generic IoT reference architecture proposed by
GISFI –IoT- WG. The IoT reference architecture of GISFI follows conceptual
model presented in ﬁgure [6].

GISFI IoT reference architecture is partitioned into four layers namely
device layer, gateway layer, service platform layer and application layer.
Different layers are described in brief below following the GISFI – IoT-
contribution [6].

• IoT Device Layer
IoT devices are included in this layer. This layer consists of individual
sensors, network enabled objects and capillary networks consisting of data
sources that are near to the physical environment. It includes heterogeneous
devices (including sensors and actuators) supporting diverse communication
standards such as Zigbee, ZWave, ANTS andWi-Fi, etc.

• IoT Gateway Layer
This layer consists of IoT gateways. The substantial heterogeneity of de-
vices and technologies hosted by the device layer is abstracted using gateways

Interoperation among IoT Standards 261

that can provide more uniform interface to IoT service platform layer. It is also
possible that a capable device can implement both IoT device and gateway
layer/functionality into a single physical entity and connects to IoT service
platform layer through the core network.

• IoT Service Platform Layer
This deﬁnes and provides different IoT service abstractions that can be
used by multiple applications. There can be a set of platform services from the
IoT platform infrastructure. Further the same framework can be extended to
application services where some of the reusable application components are
available as services.

The physical entities involved in the above three layers need suitable
communication infrastructure for information exchange. While device layer
addresses this requirement using various legacy technologies which are out
of scope for this document, the gateway layer and service platform layer are
expected to be connected over an IoT Core / Backbone network. The IoT Core
is envisaged to be predominantly an IP based network and that is in line with
the vision of IoT. This IP connectivity could be supported over multitudes of
telecommunication infrastructures such as DSL, Cellular networks (2G, 3G,
4G) etc.

interfaces of these layers stated above.

• IoT Application Layer
This layer consists of different IoT applications.
GISFI IoT architecture has following interface reference points at the
• I1: Interface from device layer to gateway layer,
• I2: Interface from gateway layer to service platform layer through IoT
core network
• I3: Interface from service platform to layer speciﬁc vertical applications
Each of these interface points will beneﬁt from a standardized informa-
tion exchange because of the diversity of devices, manufacturers, service
providers, and service consumers involved. Each of these interface points
are expected to support a set of specialized capabilities which may form a
set of standardized adapters designed for purpose. These adapters may im-
plement existing protocols or needs new developments or extension based
on requirements gathered from various IoT use cases. Figure 9 shows the
GISFI IoT interfaces. Functionalities of these interfaces are summarized in
Table 1 [6].

2.3 ETSI and GISFI standard-organization comparison and

scope of their interoperation

This section presents scope of technical interoperation between ETSI and
GISFI standards.

Comparison of interfaces proposed by GISFI– IoT–WG and ETSI-M2M-
WG are presented in table 2 below based on the GISFI contribution [7]. M2M
and IoT reference architecture of ETSI and GISFI indicating interfaces are
presented in Figure 10.

Table 2 represents comparisons of interfaces of ETSI M2M and GISFI
IoT reference architecture. GISFI IoT architecture proposes three (I1, I2,

Capabilities
This is the reference interface between the IoT device and IoT gate-
way. I1 will accommodate co-existence of multiple legacy link level
and sensor network standards. A uniﬁed data interchange format
between sensors and gateway can be a focus here.
I1a is the interface that has the capability of handling the data path
between devices and gateway.
Device speciﬁc management functions such as sensor sampling
conﬁguration, security settings, device registration, device health
check, ﬁrmware upgrade etc will be done through this interface.
This is the reference interface between the IoTgateway and IoT-
service platform. Service platform is an application middleware
providing platform services to build domain speciﬁc applications.
This has a data path as well as management path. The connectivity
is provided using IoT Core Network which is predominantly any IP
capable core network infrastructure such as xDSL, 3GPP, 3GPP2.
It exchanges the data that includes various sensor observations,
aggregates from the IoTgateway to the IoT Service Platform.
This interface takes care of the gateway management func-
tions including security/authentication conﬁguration, ﬁrmware up-
gradation, application download, health monitoring etc.
This interface takes care of communication between gateways to
enable mobility, resilience, and scalability.
This interface provides a uniform access of various IoT services to
the domain speciﬁc vertical applications. The applications may run
at different physical entities but they need to have the IoT services
access from multiple service providers.
This interface exposes the access to various data services
This interface provides access to various management and adminis-
trative services. This includes user management, device registration,
storage management, IoT application store, access control, privacy
etc.
It enables IoT service platform to communicate with another IoT
service platform towards scalability and data exchange with peer
IoT systems.

dards support data and management functionalities. However I2c and I3c
deﬁned by GISFI support self-looping among similar gateways and service
platforms these functionalities are missing in reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI.

Technical-interoperability of IoT framework from different standards is
achievable as long as standards abide by the concept of three layered

architecture (sensor, core/backbone network, application/services) and con-
ceptual IoT architecture model depicted in ﬁgure 6. However semantic, syn-
tactic interoperability are achievable by performing mapping among different
groups (like mandatory, optional) of attributes of interfaces and different APIs
(application programming interface), out of scope of this article.

3 Conclusion

Establishing interoperation across various IoT reference architectures deﬁned
by different standard organizations speciﬁcally to make them technically in-
teroperable is explored in this document. The architectures consisting multiple
layers like sensors, core-network, service platform and applications possess
technical interoperability. We have elaborated architecture and functionalities
of reference interfaces proposed by GISFI. Elaboration of interfaces speciﬁed
in GISFI IoT reference architecture addressing major requirements of various
use-case scenarios is work in progress in that work group. We have compared
functionalities of proposed interfaces of reference architecture deﬁned by
ETSI and GISFI. Establishing low overhead secured path with unique naming
and addressing mechanism is still an open area for standardization. We believe
bringing different standards semantically and syntactically interoperable by
addressing main requirements of IoT framework like diverse and distributed
computing environment, low overhead communication medium, support of
critical events, and human machine interaction is another research area and
candidate for standardization.
