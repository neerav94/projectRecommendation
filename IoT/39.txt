Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners. 

 

3 

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖ 

[4]  discuss 

Caceres  and  Friday 

the  progress, 
opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability

generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype

since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

criterion  will  need  to  go  beyond  traditional  mobile 
computing  scenarios  that  use  smart  phones  and  portables, 
and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and 
embedding

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for

enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator

of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality 
of Service parameters.

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo.

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety

lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].

infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface.

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this

URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

indispensable  part  of  IoT.  With  the  growing  presence  of 
WiFi  and  4G-LTE  wireless  Internet  access,  the  evolution 
toward  ubiquitous 
communication 
networks  is  already  evident.  However,  for  the  Internet  of

criterion  will  need  to  go  beyond  traditional  mobile 
computing  scenarios  that  use  smart  phones  and  portables, 
and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and 
embedding 
into  our  environment.  For 
technology to disappear from the consciousness of the user, 
the Internet of Things demands: (1) a shared understanding

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator 
nodes, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is on the verge 
of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully 
integrated Future Internet [1]. Internet revolution led to the 
interconnection  between  people  at  an  unprecedented  scale 
and  pace.  The  next  revolution  will  be  the  interconnection 
between  objects  to  create  a  smart  environment.  Only  in

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile 
network operators alone spanning vertical segments such as 
health,  automotive,  utilities  and  consumer  electronics.  A

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality 
of Service parameters.

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface.

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same.

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24].

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners,

and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29].

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

indispensable  part  of  IoT.  With  the  growing  presence  of 
WiFi  and  4G-LTE  wireless  Internet  access,  the  evolution 
toward  ubiquitous 
communication 
networks  is  already  evident.  However,  for  the  Internet  of

criterion  will  need  to  go  beyond  traditional  mobile 
computing  scenarios  that  use  smart  phones  and  portables, 
and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator 
nodes, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is on the verge 
of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully 
integrated Future Internet [1]. Internet revolution led to the 
interconnection  between  people  at  an  unprecedented  scale 
and  pace.  The  next  revolution  will  be  the  interconnection 
between  objects  to  create  a  smart  environment.  Only  in

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile 
network operators alone spanning vertical segments such as 
health,  automotive,  utilities  and  consumer  electronics.  A

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface. 

system 

for 

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing 

far, 

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

indispensable  part  of  IoT.  With  the  growing  presence  of 
WiFi  and  4G-LTE  wireless  Internet  access,  the  evolution 
toward  ubiquitous

criterion  will  need  to  go  beyond  traditional  mobile 
computing  scenarios  that  use  smart  phones  and  portables, 
and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and

Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information

enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator

of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] – 

 

4 

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface. 

system 

for 

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing 

far, 

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a

addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water

ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and

main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly

significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including

including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system,

presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets,

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and

enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator

of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9

billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface.

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing 

far, 

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

and provided by local government to city inhabitants. 

includes 

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps 
identify 
suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor

detection  (as  part  of  sophisticated  video  analytics)  is  in  its 
infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs 

Figure 4: Conceptual IoT framework with Cloud Computing at the centre 

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research

problems  that can be addressed include vehicle  travel  time 
on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44]. 

logistics  management 

Another  important  application  in  mobile  IoT  domain  is 
efficient 
includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise 
domain  but  transport  planning  is  carried  out  using  a  large 
scale IoT network.  

[39].  This 

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

analytics  tools,  visualization  platforms  and  client  delivery. 
The  cost  based  model  that  Cloud  computing  offers  will 
enable  end-to-end  service  provisioning  for  businesses  and 
users to access applications on demand from anywhere. 

The  next  wave  in  the  era  of  computing  will  be  outside 
the  realm  of  the  traditional  desktop.  In  the  Internet  of 
Things  (IoT)  paradigm,  many  of  the  objects  that  surround 
us  will  be  on  the  network  in  one  form  or  another.  Radio 
Frequency  IDentification  (RFID)  and  sensor  network 
technologies will rise to meet this new challenge, in which 
information  and  communication  systems  are  invisibly 
embedded in the environment around us. This results in the 
generation  of  enormous  amounts  of  data  which  have  to  be 
stored, processed and presented in a seamless, efficient and 
easily  interpretable  form.  This  model  will  consist  of 
services  that  are  commodities  and  delivered  in  a  manner 
similar  to  traditional  commodities.  Cloud  computing  can 
provide the virtual infrastructure for such utility computing 
which  integrates  monitoring  devices,  storage  devices,

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-
aware  computation  using  network 
is  an 
indispensable  part  of  IoT.  With  the  growing  presence  of 
WiFi  and  4G-LTE  wireless  Internet  access,  the  evolution 
toward  ubiquitous

and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator 
nodes, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is on the verge 
of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully 
integrated Future Internet [1]. Internet revolution led to the 
interconnection  between  people  at  an  unprecedented  scale 
and  pace.  The  next  revolution  will  be  the  interconnection 
between  objects  to  create  a  smart  environment.  Only  in

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile 
network operators alone spanning vertical segments such as 
health,  automotive,  utilities  and  consumer  electronics.  A

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. 

systems 

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality 
of Service parameters.

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] – 

 

4 

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface. 

system 

for 

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same.

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24].

Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29].

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

considering  health  and  well  being  issues;  transport  in  light 
of  its  impact  on  mobility,  productivity,  pollution;  and 
services  in  terms  of  critical  community  services  managed 
and provided by local government to city inhabitants.

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps 
identify 
suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor

detection  (as  part  of  sophisticated  video  analytics)  is  in  its 
infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs 

Figure 4: Conceptual IoT framework with Cloud Computing at the centre 

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research

problems  that can be addressed include vehicle  travel  time 
on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44]. 

logistics  management 

Another  important  application  in  mobile  IoT  domain  is 
efficient 
includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise 
domain  but  transport  planning  is  carried  out  using  a  large 
scale IoT network.  

[39].  This 

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The 

requirements 

are

autonomic  manager,  while  the  managers  effectors  will 
control  Scheduling  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  From  a 
logical  point  of  view  the  two  components  that  will  mostly 
take advantage from the introduction of autonomic features 
in  Aneka  are  the  application  scheduler  and  the  dynamic 
resource provisioning. 

5.2. Application scheduler and Dynamic Resource 
Provisioning in Aneka for IoT applications 

The  Aneka  scheduler  is  responsible  for  assigning  each 
resource to a task in an application  for execution based on 
user  QoS  parameters  and  the  overall  cost  for  the  service 
provider.  Depending  on 
the  computation  and  data 
requirements  of  each  Sensor  Application,  it  directs  the 
dynamic  resource-provisioning  component  to  instantiate  or 
terminate  a  specified  number  of  computing,  storage,  and 
network resources while maintaining a queue of tasks to be 
scheduled.  This  logic  is  embedded  as  multi-objective 
application scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is able to 
mange  resource  failures  by  reallocting  those  tasks  to  other 
suitable Cloud resources.

The  Dynamic  Resource  Provisioning  component 
implements  the  logic  for  provisioning  and  managing 
virtualised  resources  in  the  private  and  public  cloud 
computing 
resource 
requirements as directed by the application scheduler. This 
is  achieved  by  dynamically  negotiating  with  the  Cloud 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  providers  for  the  right 
kind  of  resource  for  a  certain  time  and  cost  by  taking  into 
account  the  past  execution  history  of  applications  and 
budget availability. This decision is made at run-time, when 
SaaS applications continuously send requests  to the  Aneka 
cloud platform [47].

 Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform,  offered  by 
Microsoft,  includes  four  components  as  summarized  in 
[46].  There  are  several  advantages  for  integrating  Azure 
and  Aneka.  Aneka  can  launch  any  number  of  instances  on 
the  Azure  cloud  to  run  their  applications.  Essentially,  it

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

The  cost  based  model  that  Cloud  computing  offers  will 
enable  end-to-end  service  provisioning  for  businesses  and 
users to access applications on demand from anywhere. 

The  next  wave  in  the  era  of  computing  will  be  outside 
the  realm  of  the  traditional  desktop.  In  the  Internet  of 
Things  (IoT)  paradigm,  many  of  the  objects  that  surround 
us  will  be  on  the  network  in  one  form  or  another.  Radio 
Frequency  IDentification  (RFID)  and  sensor  network 
technologies will rise to meet this new challenge, in which 
information  and  communication  systems  are  invisibly 
embedded in the environment around us. This results in the 
generation  of  enormous  amounts  of  data  which  have  to  be 
stored, processed and presented in a seamless, efficient and 
easily  interpretable  form.  This  model  will  consist  of 
services  that  are  commodities  and  delivered  in  a  manner 
similar  to  traditional  commodities.  Cloud  computing  can 
provide the virtual infrastructure for such utility computing 
which  integrates  monitoring  devices,  storage  devices,

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

is  an 
indispensable  part  of  IoT.  With  the  growing  presence  of 
WiFi  and  4G-LTE  wireless  Internet  access,  the  evolution 
toward  ubiquitous 
communication 
networks  is  already  evident.  However,  for  the  Internet  of 
Things  vision  to  successfully  emerge,  the  computing 
criterion  will  need  to  go  beyond  traditional  mobile 
computing  scenarios  that  use  smart  phones  and  portables, 
and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and 
embedding 
into  our  environment.  For 
technology to disappear from the consciousness of the user, 
the Internet of Things demands: (1) a shared understanding 
of  the  situation  of  its  users  and  their  appliances,  (2)

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator 
nodes, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is on the verge 
of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully 
integrated Future Internet [1]. Internet revolution led to the 
interconnection  between  people  at  an  unprecedented  scale 
and  pace.  The  next  revolution  will  be  the  interconnection 
between  objects  to  create  a  smart  environment.  Only  in

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile 
network operators alone spanning vertical segments such as 
health,  automotive,  utilities  and  consumer  electronics.  A 
schematic  of  the  interconnection  of  objects  is  depicted  in

on the  scale of the impact of  the data generated. The users

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface. 

system

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

considering  health  and  well  being  issues;  transport  in  light 
of  its  impact  on  mobility,  productivity,  pollution;  and 
services  in  terms  of  critical  community  services  managed 
and provided by local government to city inhabitants.

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps 
identify 
suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor

detection  (as  part  of  sophisticated  video  analytics)  is  in  its 
infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research

problems  that can be addressed include vehicle  travel  time 
on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44]. 

logistics  management 

Another  important  application  in  mobile  IoT  domain  is 
efficient 
includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise 
domain  but  transport  planning  is  carried  out  using  a  large 
scale IoT network.  

[39].  This 

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The 

requirements 

are

autonomic  manager,  while  the  managers  effectors  will 
control  Scheduling  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  From  a 
logical  point  of  view  the  two  components  that  will  mostly 
take advantage from the introduction of autonomic features 
in  Aneka  are  the  application  scheduler  and  the  dynamic 
resource provisioning. 

5.2. Application scheduler and Dynamic Resource 
Provisioning in Aneka for IoT applications 

The  Aneka  scheduler  is  responsible  for  assigning  each 
resource to a task in an application  for execution based on 
user  QoS  parameters  and  the  overall  cost  for  the  service 
provider.  Depending  on 
the  computation  and  data 
requirements  of  each  Sensor  Application,  it  directs  the 
dynamic  resource-provisioning  component  to  instantiate  or 
terminate  a  specified  number  of  computing,  storage,  and 
network resources while maintaining a queue of tasks to be 
scheduled.  This  logic  is  embedded  as  multi-objective 
application scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is able to 
mange  resource  failures  by  reallocting  those  tasks  to  other 
suitable Cloud resources.

based 

on 

environments 

The  Dynamic  Resource  Provisioning  component 
implements  the  logic  for  provisioning  and  managing 
virtualised  resources  in  the  private  and  public  cloud 
computing 
resource 
requirements as directed by the application scheduler. This 
is  achieved  by  dynamically  negotiating  with  the  Cloud 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  providers  for  the  right 
kind  of  resource  for  a  certain  time  and  cost  by  taking  into 
account  the  past  execution  history  of  applications  and 
budget availability. This decision is made at run-time, when 
SaaS applications continuously send requests  to the  Aneka 
cloud platform [47]. 

the 

6. IoT Sensor Data Analytics SaaS using Aneka and 
Microsoft Azure 

 Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform,  offered  by 
Microsoft,  includes  four  components  as  summarized  in 
[46].  There  are  several  advantages  for  integrating  Azure 
and  Aneka.  Aneka  can  launch  any  number  of  instances  on 
the  Azure  cloud  to  run  their  applications.  Essentially,  it 
provides  the  provisioning  infrastructure.  Similarly,  Aneka 

 

provides  advanced  PaaS  features  as  shown  in  Figure  5.  It 
provides  multiple  programming  models  (Task,  Thread, 
MapReduce), 
services,  workload 
management  services,  dynamic  provisioning,  QoS  based 
scheduling and flexible billing.

As  discussed  earlier,  trealizese  thubicompmp  vision, 
tools  and  data  needs  to  be  shared  between  application 
developers to create new apps. There are two major hurdles 
in  such  an  implementation.  Firstly,  interaction  between 
clouds becomes critical which is addressed by Aneka in the 
InterCloud  model.  Aneka  support  for  InterCloud  model 
enables 
the  creation  of  a  hybrid  Cloud  computing 
environment  which  combines  the  resources  of  private  and 
public Clouds. That is, whenever private Cloud is unable to 
meet  application  QoS  requirements,  Aneka  leases  extra 
capability  from  public  Cloud  to  ensure  that  application  is 
able  to  execute  within  a  specified  deadline  in  a  seamless 
manner  [47].  Secondly,  data  analytics  and  artificial 

intelligence  tools  are  computationally  demanding  which 
requires  huge  resources.  For  data  analytics  and  artificial 
intelligence  tools,  the  Aneka  task  programming  model 
provides  the  ability  of  expressing  applications  as  a 
collection  of  independent  tasks.  Each  task  can  perform 
different  operations,  or  the  same  operation  on  different 
data,  and  can  be  executed  in  any  order  by  the  runtime 
environment.  In  order  to  demonstrate  this,  we  have  used  a 
scenario  where  there  are  multiple  analytics  algorithm  and 
multiple  data  sources.  A  schematic  of  the  interaction 
between  Aneka  and  Azure  is  given  in  Figure  6  where 
Aneka  Worker  Containers  are  deployed  as  instances  of 
Azure  Worker  Role.  The  Aneka  Master  Container  will  be 
deployed  in  the  on-premises  private  cloud,  while  Aneka 
Worker  Containers  will  be  run  as  instances  of  Microsoft 
Azure  Worker  Role.  As  shown  in  the  Figure  6,  there  are 
two  types  of  Microsoft  Azure  Worker  Roles  used.  These 
are  the  Aneka  Worker  Role  and  Message  Proxy  Role.  In 
this  case,  one  instance  of  the  Message  Proxy  Role  and  at 
least one instance of the Aneka Worker Role are deployed. 
The  maximum  number  of  instances  of  the  Aneka  Worker 
Role  that  can  be  launched  is  limited  by  the  subscription 
offer of Microsoft Azure Service that a user selects. In this 
deployment scenario, when a user submits an application to 
the  Aneka  Master,  the  job  units  will  be  scheduled  by  the 
Aneka  Master  by  leveraging  on-premises  Aneka  Workers, 
if  they  exist,  and  Aneka  Worker  instances  on  Microsoft 
Azure  simultaneously.  When  Aneka  Workers  finish  the 
execution  of  Aneka  work  units,  they  will  send  the  results

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

The  cost  based  model  that  Cloud  computing  offers  will 
enable  end-to-end  service  provisioning  for  businesses  and 
users to access applications on demand from anywhere. 

The  next  wave  in  the  era  of  computing  will  be  outside 
the  realm  of  the  traditional  desktop.  In  the  Internet  of 
Things  (IoT)  paradigm,  many  of  the  objects  that  surround 
us  will  be  on  the  network  in  one  form  or  another.  Radio 
Frequency  IDentification  (RFID)  and  sensor  network 
technologies will rise to meet this new challenge, in which 
information  and  communication  systems  are  invisibly 
embedded in the environment around us. This results in the 
generation  of  enormous  amounts  of  data  which  have  to  be 
stored, processed and presented in a seamless, efficient and 
easily  interpretable  form.  This  model  will  consist  of 
services  that  are  commodities  and  delivered  in  a  manner 
similar  to  traditional  commodities.  Cloud  computing  can 
provide the virtual infrastructure for such utility computing 
which  integrates  monitoring  devices,  storage  devices,

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator 
nodes, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is on the verge 
of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully 
integrated Future Internet [1]. Internet revolution led to the 
interconnection  between  people  at  an  unprecedented  scale 
and  pace.  The  next  revolution  will  be  the  interconnection 
between  objects  to  create  a  smart  environment.  Only  in

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile 
network operators alone spanning vertical segments such as 
health,  automotive,  utilities  and  consumer  electronics.  A

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. 

systems 

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality 
of Service parameters.

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] – 

 

4 

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface. 

system 

for 

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps

suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor

infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research

problems  that can be addressed include vehicle  travel  time 
on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44]. 

logistics  management 

Another  important  application  in  mobile  IoT  domain  is 
efficient 
includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise 
domain  but  transport  planning  is  carried  out  using  a  large 
scale IoT network.  

[39].  This 

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The 

requirements 

are

autonomic  manager,  while  the  managers  effectors  will 
control  Scheduling  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  From  a 
logical  point  of  view  the  two  components  that  will  mostly 
take advantage from the introduction of autonomic features 
in  Aneka  are  the  application  scheduler  and  the  dynamic 
resource provisioning. 

5.2. Application scheduler and Dynamic Resource 
Provisioning in Aneka for IoT applications 

The  Aneka  scheduler  is  responsible  for  assigning  each 
resource to a task in an application  for execution based on 
user  QoS  parameters  and  the  overall  cost  for  the  service 
provider.  Depending  on 
the  computation  and  data 
requirements  of  each  Sensor  Application,  it  directs  the 
dynamic  resource-provisioning  component  to  instantiate  or 
terminate  a  specified  number  of  computing,  storage,  and 
network resources while maintaining a queue of tasks to be 
scheduled.  This  logic  is  embedded  as  multi-objective 
application scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is able to 
mange  resource  failures  by  reallocting  those  tasks  to  other 
suitable Cloud resources.

based 

on 

environments 

The  Dynamic  Resource  Provisioning  component 
implements  the  logic  for  provisioning  and  managing 
virtualised  resources  in  the  private  and  public  cloud 
computing 
resource 
requirements as directed by the application scheduler. This 
is  achieved  by  dynamically  negotiating  with  the  Cloud 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  providers  for  the  right 
kind  of  resource  for  a  certain  time  and  cost  by  taking  into 
account  the  past  execution  history  of  applications  and 
budget availability. This decision is made at run-time, when 
SaaS applications continuously send requests  to the  Aneka 
cloud platform [47]. 

the 

6. IoT Sensor Data Analytics SaaS using Aneka and 
Microsoft Azure 

 Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform,  offered  by 
Microsoft,  includes  four  components  as  summarized  in 
[46].  There  are  several  advantages  for  integrating  Azure 
and  Aneka.  Aneka  can  launch  any  number  of  instances  on 
the  Azure  cloud  to  run  their  applications.  Essentially,  it 
provides  the  provisioning  infrastructure.  Similarly,  Aneka 

 

provides  advanced  PaaS  features  as  shown  in  Figure  5.  It 
provides  multiple  programming  models  (Task,  Thread, 
MapReduce), 
services,  workload 
management  services,  dynamic  provisioning,  QoS  based 
scheduling and flexible billing.

As  discussed  earlier,  trealizese  thubicompmp  vision, 
tools  and  data  needs  to  be  shared  between  application 
developers to create new apps. There are two major hurdles 
in  such  an  implementation.  Firstly,  interaction  between 
clouds becomes critical which is addressed by Aneka in the 
InterCloud  model.  Aneka  support  for  InterCloud  model 
enables 
the  creation  of  a  hybrid  Cloud  computing 
environment  which  combines  the  resources  of  private  and 
public Clouds. That is, whenever private Cloud is unable to 
meet  application  QoS  requirements,  Aneka  leases  extra 
capability  from  public  Cloud  to  ensure  that  application  is 
able  to  execute  within  a  specified  deadline  in  a  seamless 
manner  [47].  Secondly,  data  analytics  and  artificial 

intelligence  tools  are  computationally  demanding  which 
requires  huge  resources.  For  data  analytics  and  artificial 
intelligence  tools,  the  Aneka  task  programming  model 
provides  the  ability  of  expressing  applications  as  a 
collection  of  independent  tasks.  Each  task  can  perform 
different  operations,  or  the  same  operation  on  different 
data,  and  can  be  executed  in  any  order  by  the  runtime 
environment.  In  order  to  demonstrate  this,  we  have  used  a 
scenario  where  there  are  multiple  analytics  algorithm  and 
multiple  data  sources.  A  schematic  of  the  interaction 
between  Aneka  and  Azure  is  given  in  Figure  6  where 
Aneka  Worker  Containers  are  deployed  as  instances  of 
Azure  Worker  Role.  The  Aneka  Master  Container  will  be 
deployed  in  the  on-premises  private  cloud,  while  Aneka 
Worker  Containers  will  be  run  as  instances  of  Microsoft 
Azure  Worker  Role.  As  shown  in  the  Figure  6,  there  are 
two  types  of  Microsoft  Azure  Worker  Roles  used.  These 
are  the  Aneka  Worker  Role  and  Message  Proxy  Role.  In 
this  case,  one  instance  of  the  Message  Proxy  Role  and  at 
least one instance of the Aneka Worker Role are deployed. 
The  maximum  number  of  instances  of  the  Aneka  Worker 
Role  that  can  be  launched  is  limited  by  the  subscription 
offer of Microsoft Azure Service that a user selects. In this 
deployment scenario, when a user submits an application to 
the  Aneka  Master,  the  job  units  will  be  scheduled  by  the 
Aneka  Master  by  leveraging  on-premises  Aneka  Workers, 
if  they  exist,  and  Aneka  Worker  instances  on  Microsoft 
Azure  simultaneously.  When  Aneka  Workers  finish  the 
execution  of  Aneka  work  units,  they  will  send  the  results

back to Aneka Master, and then Aneka Master will send the 
result back to the user application. 

7. Open Challenges and Future Directions 

The  proposed  Cloud  centric  vision  comprises  of  a 
flexible  and  open  architecture  that  is  user  centric  and 
enables different players to interact in the IoT framework. It 
allows  interaction  in  a  manner  suitable  for  their  own 
requirements, rather than the IoT being thrust upon them. In 
this  way,  the  framework  includes  provisions  to  meet 
different requirements for data ownership, security, privacy, 
and sharing of information.  

Some  open  challenges  are  discussed  based  on  the  IoT 
elements  presented  earlier.  The  challenges  include  IoT 
specific  challenges  such  as  privacy,  participatory  sensing, 
data  analytics,  GIS  based  visualization  and  Cloud 
computing  apart  from  the  standard  WSN  challenges 
including 
security, 
protocols,  and  Quality  of  Service.  The  end  goal  is  to  have 
Plug  n‘  Play  smart  objects  which  can  be  deployed  in  any 
environment with an interoperable backbone allowing them 
to  blend  with  other 
them. 
Standardization  of  frequency  bands  and  protocols  plays  a 
pivotal role in accomplishing this goal.

A  roadmap  of  key  developments  in  IoT  research  in  the 
context  of  pervasive  applications  is  shown  in  Figure  8, 
which  includes  the  technology  drivers  and  key  application 
outcomes expected in the next decade [8]. The section ends 
with  a  few  international  initiatives  in  the  domain  which 
could  play  a  vital  role  in  the  success  of  this  rapidly 
emerging technology. 

7.1. Architecture 

the  challenges  particularly 

Overall architecture followed at the initial stages of  IoT 
research  will  have  a  severe  bearing  on  the  field  itself  and 
needs  to  be  investigated.  Most  of  the  work  relating  to  IoT 
architecture  has  been  from  the  wireless  sensor  networks 
perspective [48]. European Union projects of SENSEI [49] 
and Internet of Things-Architecture (IoT-A) [50] have been 
addressing 
from  WSN 
perspective and  have been very successful  for defining the 
architecture  for  different  applications.  We  are  referring 
architecture  to  overall  IoT  where  the  user  is  at  the  center 
and will enable the use of data and infrastructure to develop 
new  applications.  An  architecture  based  on  cloud 
computing  at  the  center  has  been  proposed  in  this  paper. 
However,  this  may  not  be  the  best  option  for  every 
application  domain  particularly  for  defense  where  human 
intelligence  is  relied  upon.  Although  we  see  cloud  centric 
architecture  to  be  the  best  where  cost  based  services  are 
required,  other  architectures  should  be  investigated  for 
different application domains. 

feature 

Another 

required 

important 

for  seamless 
independent IoT working architecture is SaaS to be updated 
by  the  developers  dynamically.  In  this  example,  analytics 
tools (usually in the form of DLLs) have to be updated and 
used  by  several  clients.  Due  to  administrative  privileges 
provided  by  Azure,  this  becomes  a  non-trivial  task. 
Management  Extensibility  Framework  (MEF)  provides  a 
simple solution to the problem. The MEF is a composition 
layer for .NET that improves the flexibility, maintainability 
and  testability  of  large  applications.  MEF  can  be  used  for 
third-party plugin, or it can bring the benefits of a loosely-
coupled  plugin-like  architecture  for  regular  applications.  It 
is a library for creating lightweight, extensible applications. 
It  allows  application  developers  to  discover  and  use 
extensions  with  no  configuration  required.  It  also  lets 
extension  developers  easily  encapsulate  code  and  avoid 
fragile hard dependencies. MEF not only allows extensions 
to be reused  within applications, but across applications as 
well. MEF provides a standard way for the host application 
to  expose 
itself  and  consume  external  extensions. 
Extensions, by their nature, can be reused amongst different 
applications.  However,  an  extension  could  still  be 
implemented  in  a  way  that  is  application-specific.  The 
extensions themselves can depend on one another and MEF 
will make sure they are wired together in the correct order. 
One  of  the  key  design  goals  of  IoT  web  application  is,  it 
would  be  extensible  and  MEF  provides  this  solution.  With 
MEF  we  can  use  different  algorithms  (as  and  when  it 
becomes  available)  for  IoT  data  analytics:  e.g.  drop  an 

Figure 7: System Context Diagram 

analytics  assembly  into  a  folder  and  it  instantly  becomes 
available to the application. The system context diagram of 
the developed data analytics is given in Figure 7.

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

The  cost  based  model  that  Cloud  computing  offers  will 
enable  end-to-end  service  provisioning  for  businesses  and 
users to access applications on demand from anywhere. 

The  next  wave  in  the  era  of  computing  will  be  outside 
the  realm  of  the  traditional  desktop.  In  the  Internet  of 
Things  (IoT)  paradigm,  many  of  the  objects  that  surround 
us  will  be  on  the  network  in  one  form  or  another.  Radio 
Frequency  IDentification  (RFID)  and  sensor  network 
technologies will rise to meet this new challenge, in which 
information  and  communication  systems  are  invisibly 
embedded in the environment around us. This results in the 
generation  of  enormous  amounts  of  data  which  have  to  be 
stored, processed and presented in a seamless, efficient and 
easily  interpretable  form.  This  model  will  consist  of 
services  that  are  commodities  and  delivered  in  a  manner 
similar  to  traditional  commodities.  Cloud  computing  can

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator

of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. 

systems 

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality 
of Service parameters.

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] – 

 

4 

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface. 

system

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same.

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29].

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

of  its  impact  on  mobility,  productivity,  pollution;  and

and provided by local government to city inhabitants.

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps 
identify 
suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor

detection  (as  part  of  sophisticated  video  analytics)  is  in  its 
infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs 

Figure 4: Conceptual IoT framework with Cloud Computing at the centre 

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research

problems  that can be addressed include vehicle  travel  time 
on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44]. 

logistics  management 

Another  important  application  in  mobile  IoT  domain  is 
efficient 
includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise 
domain  but  transport  planning  is  carried  out  using  a  large 
scale IoT network.  

[39].  This 

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The 

requirements 

are

autonomic  manager,  while  the  managers  effectors  will 
control  Scheduling  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  From  a 
logical  point  of  view  the  two  components  that  will  mostly 
take advantage from the introduction of autonomic features 
in  Aneka  are  the  application  scheduler  and  the  dynamic 
resource provisioning. 

5.2. Application scheduler and Dynamic Resource 
Provisioning in Aneka for IoT applications 

The  Aneka  scheduler  is  responsible  for  assigning  each 
resource to a task in an application  for execution based on 
user  QoS  parameters  and  the  overall  cost  for  the  service 
provider.  Depending  on 
the  computation  and  data 
requirements  of  each  Sensor  Application,  it  directs  the 
dynamic  resource-provisioning  component  to  instantiate  or 
terminate  a  specified  number  of  computing,  storage,  and 
network resources while maintaining a queue of tasks to be 
scheduled.  This  logic  is  embedded  as  multi-objective 
application scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is able to 
mange  resource  failures  by  reallocting  those  tasks  to  other 
suitable Cloud resources.

based 

on 

environments 

The  Dynamic  Resource  Provisioning  component 
implements  the  logic  for  provisioning  and  managing 
virtualised  resources  in  the  private  and  public  cloud 
computing 
resource 
requirements as directed by the application scheduler. This 
is  achieved  by  dynamically  negotiating  with  the  Cloud 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  providers  for  the  right 
kind  of  resource  for  a  certain  time  and  cost  by  taking  into 
account  the  past  execution  history  of  applications  and 
budget availability. This decision is made at run-time, when 
SaaS applications continuously send requests  to the  Aneka 
cloud platform [47]. 

the 

6. IoT Sensor Data Analytics SaaS using Aneka and 
Microsoft Azure 

 Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform,  offered  by 
Microsoft,  includes  four  components  as  summarized  in 
[46].  There  are  several  advantages  for  integrating  Azure 
and  Aneka.  Aneka  can  launch  any  number  of  instances  on 
the  Azure  cloud  to  run  their  applications.  Essentially,  it 
provides  the  provisioning  infrastructure.  Similarly,  Aneka 

 

provides  advanced  PaaS  features  as  shown  in  Figure  5.  It 
provides  multiple  programming  models  (Task,  Thread, 
MapReduce), 
services,  workload 
management  services,  dynamic  provisioning,  QoS  based 
scheduling and flexible billing.

As  discussed  earlier,  trealizese  thubicompmp  vision, 
tools  and  data  needs  to  be  shared  between  application 
developers to create new apps. There are two major hurdles 
in  such  an  implementation.  Firstly,  interaction  between 
clouds becomes critical which is addressed by Aneka in the 
InterCloud  model.  Aneka  support  for  InterCloud  model 
enables 
the  creation  of  a  hybrid  Cloud  computing 
environment  which  combines  the  resources  of  private  and 
public Clouds. That is, whenever private Cloud is unable to 
meet  application  QoS  requirements,  Aneka  leases  extra 
capability  from  public  Cloud  to  ensure  that  application  is 
able  to  execute  within  a  specified  deadline  in  a  seamless 
manner  [47].  Secondly,  data  analytics  and  artificial 

intelligence  tools  are  computationally  demanding  which 
requires  huge  resources.  For  data  analytics  and  artificial 
intelligence  tools,  the  Aneka  task  programming  model 
provides  the  ability  of  expressing  applications  as  a 
collection  of  independent  tasks.  Each  task  can  perform 
different  operations,  or  the  same  operation  on  different 
data,  and  can  be  executed  in  any  order  by  the  runtime 
environment.  In  order  to  demonstrate  this,  we  have  used  a 
scenario  where  there  are  multiple  analytics  algorithm  and 
multiple  data  sources.  A  schematic  of  the  interaction 
between  Aneka  and  Azure  is  given  in  Figure  6  where 
Aneka  Worker  Containers  are  deployed  as  instances  of 
Azure  Worker  Role.  The  Aneka  Master  Container  will  be 
deployed  in  the  on-premises  private  cloud,  while  Aneka 
Worker  Containers  will  be  run  as  instances  of  Microsoft 
Azure  Worker  Role.  As  shown  in  the  Figure  6,  there  are 
two  types  of  Microsoft  Azure  Worker  Roles  used.  These 
are  the  Aneka  Worker  Role  and  Message  Proxy  Role.  In 
this  case,  one  instance  of  the  Message  Proxy  Role  and  at 
least one instance of the Aneka Worker Role are deployed. 
The  maximum  number  of  instances  of  the  Aneka  Worker 
Role  that  can  be  launched  is  limited  by  the  subscription 
offer of Microsoft Azure Service that a user selects. In this 
deployment scenario, when a user submits an application to 
the  Aneka  Master,  the  job  units  will  be  scheduled  by  the 
Aneka  Master  by  leveraging  on-premises  Aneka  Workers, 
if  they  exist,  and  Aneka  Worker  instances  on  Microsoft 
Azure  simultaneously.  When  Aneka  Workers  finish  the 
execution  of  Aneka  work  units,  they  will  send  the  results

back to Aneka Master, and then Aneka Master will send the 
result back to the user application. 

7. Open Challenges and Future Directions 

The  proposed  Cloud  centric  vision  comprises  of  a 
flexible  and  open  architecture  that  is  user  centric  and 
enables different players to interact in the IoT framework. It 
allows  interaction  in  a  manner  suitable  for  their  own 
requirements, rather than the IoT being thrust upon them. In 
this  way,  the  framework  includes  provisions  to  meet 
different requirements for data ownership, security, privacy, 
and sharing of information.  

Some  open  challenges  are  discussed  based  on  the  IoT 
elements  presented  earlier.  The  challenges  include  IoT 
specific  challenges  such  as  privacy,  participatory  sensing, 
data  analytics,  GIS  based  visualization  and  Cloud 
computing  apart  from  the  standard  WSN  challenges 
including 
security, 
protocols,  and  Quality  of  Service.  The  end  goal  is  to  have 
Plug  n‘  Play  smart  objects  which  can  be  deployed  in  any 
environment with an interoperable backbone allowing them 
to  blend  with  other 
them. 
Standardization  of  frequency  bands  and  protocols  plays  a 
pivotal role in accomplishing this goal.

A  roadmap  of  key  developments  in  IoT  research  in  the 
context  of  pervasive  applications  is  shown  in  Figure  8, 
which  includes  the  technology  drivers  and  key  application 
outcomes expected in the next decade [8]. The section ends 
with  a  few  international  initiatives  in  the  domain  which 
could  play  a  vital  role  in  the  success  of  this  rapidly 
emerging technology. 

7.1. Architecture 

the  challenges  particularly 

Overall architecture followed at the initial stages of  IoT 
research  will  have  a  severe  bearing  on  the  field  itself  and 
needs  to  be  investigated.  Most  of  the  work  relating  to  IoT 
architecture  has  been  from  the  wireless  sensor  networks 
perspective [48]. European Union projects of SENSEI [49] 
and Internet of Things-Architecture (IoT-A) [50] have been 
addressing 
from  WSN 
perspective and  have been very successful  for defining the 
architecture  for  different  applications.  We  are  referring 
architecture  to  overall  IoT  where  the  user  is  at  the  center 
and will enable the use of data and infrastructure to develop 
new  applications.  An  architecture  based  on  cloud 
computing  at  the  center  has  been  proposed  in  this  paper. 
However,  this  may  not  be  the  best  option  for  every 
application  domain  particularly  for  defense  where  human 
intelligence  is  relied  upon.  Although  we  see  cloud  centric 
architecture  to  be  the  best  where  cost  based  services  are 
required,  other  architectures  should  be  investigated  for 
different application domains. 

feature 

Another 

required 

important 

for  seamless 
independent IoT working architecture is SaaS to be updated 
by  the  developers  dynamically.  In  this  example,  analytics 
tools (usually in the form of DLLs) have to be updated and 
used  by  several  clients.  Due  to  administrative  privileges 
provided  by  Azure,  this  becomes  a  non-trivial  task. 
Management  Extensibility  Framework  (MEF)  provides  a 
simple solution to the problem. The MEF is a composition 
layer for .NET that improves the flexibility, maintainability 
and  testability  of  large  applications.  MEF  can  be  used  for 
third-party plugin, or it can bring the benefits of a loosely-
coupled  plugin-like  architecture  for  regular  applications.  It 
is a library for creating lightweight, extensible applications. 
It  allows  application  developers  to  discover  and  use 
extensions  with  no  configuration  required.  It  also  lets 
extension  developers  easily  encapsulate  code  and  avoid 
fragile hard dependencies. MEF not only allows extensions 
to be reused  within applications, but across applications as 
well. MEF provides a standard way for the host application 
to  expose 
itself  and  consume  external  extensions. 
Extensions, by their nature, can be reused amongst different 
applications.  However,  an  extension  could  still  be 
implemented  in  a  way  that  is  application-specific.  The 
extensions themselves can depend on one another and MEF 
will make sure they are wired together in the correct order. 
One  of  the  key  design  goals  of  IoT  web  application  is,  it 
would  be  extensible  and  MEF  provides  this  solution.  With 
MEF  we  can  use  different  algorithms  (as  and  when  it 
becomes  available)  for  IoT  data  analytics:  e.g.  drop  an 

Figure 7: System Context Diagram 

analytics  assembly  into  a  folder  and  it  instantly  becomes 
available to the application. The system context diagram of 
the developed data analytics is given in Figure 7.

demands  of  multiple  sensing  modalities.  This  has 
implications  on  network  traffic,  data  storage  and  energy 
utilization.  Importantly,  this  encompasses  both  fixed  and 
mobile sensing infrastructure [51] as well as continuous and 
random sampling. A generalized framework is required for 
data  collection  and  modelling  that  effectively  exploits 
spatial and temporal characteristics of the data, both in the 
sensing  domain  as  well  as  the  associated  transform 
domains.  For  example,  urban  noise  mapping  needs  an 
uninterrupted  collection  of  noise  levels  using  battery 
powered  nodes  using  fixed  infrastructure  and  participatory 
sensing  [51]  as  a  key  component  for  health  and  quality  of 
life services for its inhabitants.

Compressive  wireless  sensing  (CWS)  utilizes  synchronous 
communication  to  reduce  the  transmission  power  of  each 
sensor  [53];  transmitting  noisy  projections  of  data  samples 
to a central location for aggregation. 

7.3. Secure reprogrammable networks and Privacy 

Security will be a major concern wherever networks are 
deployed at large scale. There can be many ways the system 
could  be  attacked  -  disabling  the  network  availability; 
pushing erroneous data into the network; accessing personal 
information;  etc.  The  three  physical  components  of  IoT  - 
RFID,  WSN  and  cloud  are  vulnerable  to  such  attacks. 
Security is critical to any network [54,55] and the first line 
of defence against data corruption is cryptography. 

Of the three, RFID (particularly passive) seems to be the 
most  vulnerable as it allows  person tracking as  well as  the

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

indispensable  part  of  IoT.  With  the  growing  presence  of 
WiFi  and  4G-LTE  wireless  Internet  access,  the  evolution 
toward  ubiquitous 
communication 
networks  is  already  evident.  However,  for  the  Internet  of

criterion  will  need  to  go  beyond  traditional  mobile 
computing  scenarios  that  use  smart  phones  and  portables, 
and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and 
embedding

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator 
nodes, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is on the verge 
of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully 
integrated Future Internet [1]. Internet revolution led to the 
interconnection  between  people  at  an  unprecedented  scale 
and  pace.  The  next  revolution  will  be  the  interconnection 
between  objects  to  create  a  smart  environment.  Only  in

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile 
network operators alone spanning vertical segments such as 
health,  automotive,  utilities  and  consumer  electronics.  A

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality 
of Service parameters.

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface.

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

of  its  impact  on  mobility,  productivity,  pollution;  and

and provided by local government to city inhabitants. 

includes 

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps 
identify 
suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor

detection  (as  part  of  sophisticated  video  analytics)  is  in  its 
infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs 

Figure 4: Conceptual IoT framework with Cloud Computing at the centre 

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research 

 

9 

 

problems  that can be addressed include vehicle  travel  time 
on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44]. 

logistics  management 

Another  important  application  in  mobile  IoT  domain  is 
efficient 
includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise 
domain  but  transport  planning  is  carried  out  using  a  large 
scale IoT network.  

[39].  This 

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The 

requirements 

are 

 

Figure 5: Overview of Aneka within Internet of Things Architecture  [45] 
autonomic  manager,  while  the  managers  effectors  will 
control  Scheduling  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  From  a 
logical  point  of  view  the  two  components  that  will  mostly 
take advantage from the introduction of autonomic features 
in  Aneka  are  the  application  scheduler  and  the  dynamic 
resource provisioning. 

5.2. Application scheduler and Dynamic Resource 
Provisioning in Aneka for IoT applications 

The  Aneka  scheduler  is  responsible  for  assigning  each 
resource to a task in an application  for execution based on 
user  QoS  parameters  and  the  overall  cost  for  the  service 
provider.  Depending  on 
the  computation  and  data 
requirements  of  each  Sensor  Application,  it  directs  the 
dynamic  resource-provisioning  component  to  instantiate  or 
terminate  a  specified  number  of  computing,  storage,  and 
network resources while maintaining a queue of tasks to be 
scheduled.  This  logic  is  embedded  as  multi-objective 
application scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is able to 
mange  resource  failures  by  reallocting  those  tasks  to  other 
suitable Cloud resources.  

 

11 

based 

on 

environments 

The  Dynamic  Resource  Provisioning  component 
implements  the  logic  for  provisioning  and  managing 
virtualised  resources  in  the  private  and  public  cloud 
computing 
resource 
requirements as directed by the application scheduler. This 
is  achieved  by  dynamically  negotiating  with  the  Cloud 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  providers  for  the  right 
kind  of  resource  for  a  certain  time  and  cost  by  taking  into 
account  the  past  execution  history  of  applications  and 
budget availability. This decision is made at run-time, when 
SaaS applications continuously send requests  to the  Aneka 
cloud platform [47]. 

the 

6. IoT Sensor Data Analytics SaaS using Aneka and 
Microsoft Azure 

 Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform,  offered  by 
Microsoft,  includes  four  components  as  summarized  in 
[46].  There  are  several  advantages  for  integrating  Azure 
and  Aneka.  Aneka  can  launch  any  number  of  instances  on 
the  Azure  cloud  to  run  their  applications.  Essentially,  it 
provides  the  provisioning  infrastructure.  Similarly,  Aneka 

 

provides  advanced  PaaS  features  as  shown  in  Figure  5.  It 
provides  multiple  programming  models  (Task,  Thread, 
MapReduce), 
services,  workload 
management  services,  dynamic  provisioning,  QoS  based 
scheduling and flexible billing.

As  discussed  earlier,  trealizese  thubicompmp  vision, 
tools  and  data  needs  to  be  shared  between  application 
developers to create new apps. There are two major hurdles 
in  such  an  implementation.  Firstly,  interaction  between 
clouds becomes critical which is addressed by Aneka in the 
InterCloud  model.  Aneka  support  for  InterCloud  model 
enables 
the  creation  of  a  hybrid  Cloud  computing 
environment  which  combines  the  resources  of  private  and 
public Clouds. That is, whenever private Cloud is unable to 
meet  application  QoS  requirements,  Aneka  leases  extra 
capability  from  public  Cloud  to  ensure  that  application  is 
able  to  execute  within  a  specified  deadline  in  a  seamless 
manner  [47].  Secondly,  data  analytics  and  artificial 

intelligence  tools  are  computationally  demanding  which 
requires  huge  resources.  For  data  analytics  and  artificial 
intelligence  tools,  the  Aneka  task  programming  model 
provides  the  ability  of  expressing  applications  as  a 
collection  of  independent  tasks.  Each  task  can  perform 
different  operations,  or  the  same  operation  on  different 
data,  and  can  be  executed  in  any  order  by  the  runtime 
environment.  In  order  to  demonstrate  this,  we  have  used  a 
scenario  where  there  are  multiple  analytics  algorithm  and 
multiple  data  sources.  A  schematic  of  the  interaction 
between  Aneka  and  Azure  is  given  in  Figure  6  where 
Aneka  Worker  Containers  are  deployed  as  instances  of 
Azure  Worker  Role.  The  Aneka  Master  Container  will  be 
deployed  in  the  on-premises  private  cloud,  while  Aneka 
Worker  Containers  will  be  run  as  instances  of  Microsoft 
Azure  Worker  Role.  As  shown  in  the  Figure  6,  there  are 
two  types  of  Microsoft  Azure  Worker  Roles  used.  These 
are  the  Aneka  Worker  Role  and  Message  Proxy  Role.  In 
this  case,  one  instance  of  the  Message  Proxy  Role  and  at 
least one instance of the Aneka Worker Role are deployed. 
The  maximum  number  of  instances  of  the  Aneka  Worker 
Role  that  can  be  launched  is  limited  by  the  subscription 
offer of Microsoft Azure Service that a user selects. In this 
deployment scenario, when a user submits an application to 
the  Aneka  Master,  the  job  units  will  be  scheduled  by  the 
Aneka  Master  by  leveraging  on-premises  Aneka  Workers, 
if  they  exist,  and  Aneka  Worker  instances  on  Microsoft 
Azure  simultaneously.  When  Aneka  Workers  finish  the 
execution  of  Aneka  work  units,  they  will  send  the  results

back to Aneka Master, and then Aneka Master will send the 
result back to the user application. 

7. Open Challenges and Future Directions 

The  proposed  Cloud  centric  vision  comprises  of  a 
flexible  and  open  architecture  that  is  user  centric  and 
enables different players to interact in the IoT framework. It 
allows  interaction  in  a  manner  suitable  for  their  own 
requirements, rather than the IoT being thrust upon them. In 
this  way,  the  framework  includes  provisions  to  meet 
different requirements for data ownership, security, privacy, 
and sharing of information.  

Some  open  challenges  are  discussed  based  on  the  IoT 
elements  presented  earlier.  The  challenges  include  IoT 
specific  challenges  such  as  privacy,  participatory  sensing, 
data  analytics,  GIS  based  visualization  and  Cloud 
computing  apart  from  the  standard  WSN  challenges 
including 
security, 
protocols,  and  Quality  of  Service.  The  end  goal  is  to  have 
Plug  n‘  Play  smart  objects  which  can  be  deployed  in  any 
environment with an interoperable backbone allowing them 
to  blend  with  other 
them. 
Standardization  of  frequency  bands  and  protocols  plays  a 
pivotal role in accomplishing this goal.

A  roadmap  of  key  developments  in  IoT  research  in  the 
context  of  pervasive  applications  is  shown  in  Figure  8, 
which  includes  the  technology  drivers  and  key  application 
outcomes expected in the next decade [8]. The section ends 
with  a  few  international  initiatives  in  the  domain  which 
could  play  a  vital  role  in  the  success  of  this  rapidly 
emerging technology. 

7.1. Architecture 

the  challenges  particularly 

Overall architecture followed at the initial stages of  IoT 
research  will  have  a  severe  bearing  on  the  field  itself  and 
needs  to  be  investigated.  Most  of  the  work  relating  to  IoT 
architecture  has  been  from  the  wireless  sensor  networks 
perspective [48]. European Union projects of SENSEI [49] 
and Internet of Things-Architecture (IoT-A) [50] have been 
addressing 
from  WSN 
perspective and  have been very successful  for defining the 
architecture  for  different  applications.  We  are  referring 
architecture  to  overall  IoT  where  the  user  is  at  the  center 
and will enable the use of data and infrastructure to develop 
new  applications.  An  architecture  based  on  cloud 
computing  at  the  center  has  been  proposed  in  this  paper. 
However,  this  may  not  be  the  best  option  for  every 
application  domain  particularly  for  defense  where  human 
intelligence  is  relied  upon.  Although  we  see  cloud  centric 
architecture  to  be  the  best  where  cost  based  services  are 
required,  other  architectures  should  be  investigated  for 
different application domains. 

feature 

Another 

required 

important 

for  seamless 
independent IoT working architecture is SaaS to be updated 
by  the  developers  dynamically.  In  this  example,  analytics 
tools (usually in the form of DLLs) have to be updated and 
used  by  several  clients.  Due  to  administrative  privileges 
provided  by  Azure,  this  becomes  a  non-trivial  task. 
Management  Extensibility  Framework  (MEF)  provides  a 
simple solution to the problem. The MEF is a composition 
layer for .NET that improves the flexibility, maintainability 
and  testability  of  large  applications.  MEF  can  be  used  for 
third-party plugin, or it can bring the benefits of a loosely-
coupled  plugin-like  architecture  for  regular  applications.  It 
is a library for creating lightweight, extensible applications. 
It  allows  application  developers  to  discover  and  use 
extensions  with  no  configuration  required.  It  also  lets 
extension  developers  easily  encapsulate  code  and  avoid 
fragile hard dependencies. MEF not only allows extensions 
to be reused  within applications, but across applications as 
well. MEF provides a standard way for the host application 
to  expose 
itself  and  consume  external  extensions. 
Extensions, by their nature, can be reused amongst different 
applications.  However,  an  extension  could  still  be 
implemented  in  a  way  that  is  application-specific.  The 
extensions themselves can depend on one another and MEF 
will make sure they are wired together in the correct order. 
One  of  the  key  design  goals  of  IoT  web  application  is,  it 
would  be  extensible  and  MEF  provides  this  solution.  With 
MEF  we  can  use  different  algorithms  (as  and  when  it 
becomes  available)  for  IoT  data  analytics:  e.g.  drop  an 

Figure 7: System Context Diagram 

analytics  assembly  into  a  folder  and  it  instantly  becomes 
available to the application. The system context diagram of 
the developed data analytics is given in Figure 7.

environment  needs  to  simultaneously  meet  competing 
demands  of  multiple  sensing  modalities.  This  has 
implications  on  network  traffic,  data  storage  and  energy 
utilization.  Importantly,  this  encompasses  both  fixed  and 
mobile sensing infrastructure [51] as well as continuous and 
random sampling. A generalized framework is required for 
data  collection  and  modelling  that  effectively  exploits 
spatial and temporal characteristics of the data, both in the 
sensing  domain  as  well  as  the  associated  transform 
domains.  For  example,  urban  noise  mapping  needs  an 
uninterrupted  collection  of  noise  levels  using  battery 
powered  nodes  using  fixed  infrastructure  and  participatory 
sensing  [51]  as  a  key  component  for  health  and  quality  of 
life services for its inhabitants.

ubiquitous  sensing  context,  this  has  implications  for  data 
compression, network traffic and the distribution of sensors. 
Compressive  wireless  sensing  (CWS)  utilizes  synchronous 
communication  to  reduce  the  transmission  power  of  each 
sensor  [53];  transmitting  noisy  projections  of  data  samples 
to a central location for aggregation. 

7.3. Secure reprogrammable networks and Privacy 

Security will be a major concern wherever networks are 
deployed at large scale. There can be many ways the system 
could  be  attacked  -  disabling  the  network  availability; 
pushing erroneous data into the network; accessing personal 
information;  etc.  The  three  physical  components  of  IoT  - 
RFID,  WSN  and  cloud  are  vulnerable  to  such  attacks. 
Security is critical to any network [54,55] and the first line 
of defence against data corruption is cryptography. 

Of the three, RFID (particularly passive) seems to be the 
most  vulnerable as it allows  person tracking as  well as  the 

 

objects  and  no  high  level  intelligence  can  be  enabled  on 
these devices [15]. These complex problems however have 
solutions  which  can  be  provided  using  cryptographic 
methods and deserves more research before they are widely 
accepted. 

nodes 

Against  outsider  attackers,  encryption  ensures  data 
confidentiality,  whereas  message  authentication  codes 
ensure  data  integrity  and  authenticity  [56].  Encryption, 
however, does not protect against insider malicious attacks, 
to  address  which  non-cryptographic  means  are  needed, 
particularly  in  WSNs.  Also,  periodically,  new  sensor 
applications need to be installed, or existing ones need to be 
updated. This is done by remote wireless reprogramming of 
all 
network 
reprogramming  consists  solely  of  a  data  dissemination 
protocol that distributes code to all the nodes in the network 
without authentication, which is a security threat. A secure 
reprogramming  protocol  allows  the  nodes  to  authenticate 
every code update and prevent malicious installation. Most 
such  protocols  (e.g.,  [57])  are  based  on  the  benchmark 
protocol  Deluge  [58].  We  need  cryptographic  add-ons  to 
Deluge  which  lays  foundation  for  more  sophisticated 
algorithms to be developed. 

network.  Traditional

the 

Security  in  the  cloud  is  another  important  area  of 
research  which  will  need  more  attention.  Along  with  the 
presence  of  the  data  and  tools,  cloud  also  handles 
economics  of  IoT  which  will  make  it  a  bigger  threat  from 
attackers.  Security  and  identity  protection  becomes  critical 
in  hybrid  clouds  where  a  private  as  well  as  public  clouds 
will be used by businesses [59]. 

Remembering forever in the context of IoT raises many 
privacy issues as the data collected can be used in positive 
(for  advertisement  services)  and  negative  ways  (for 
defamation).  Digital  forgetting  could  emerge  as  one  of  the 
key  areas  of  research  to  address  the  concerns  and  the 
development  of  appropriate  framework  to  protect  personal 
data [44]. 

segments  often  constitute  ‗gaps‘  in  resource  guarantee  due 
to resource allocation and management ability constraints in 
shared  wireless  media.  Quality  of  Service 
in  cloud 
Computing  is  another  major  research  area  which  will 
require  more  and  more  attention  as  the  data  and  tools 
become  available  on  clouds.  Dynamic  scheduling  and 
resource  allocation  algorithms  based  on  particle  swarm 
optimization  are  being  developed.  For  high  capacity 
applications  and  as  IoT  grows,  this  could  become  a 
bottleneck. 

7.5. New protocols 

The  protocols  at  the  sensing  end  of  IoT  will  play  a  key 
role  in  complete  realisation.  They  form  the  backbone  for 
the data tunnel between sensors and the outer world. For the 
system  to  work  efficiently,  and  energy  efficient  MAC 
protocol  and  appropriate  routing  protocol  are  critical. 
Several  MAC  protocols  have  been  proposed  for  various 
domains  with  TDMA  (collision  free),  CSMA  (low  traffic 
efficiency)  and  FDMA 
requires 
additional circuitry in nodes) schemes available to the user 
[67].  None  of  them  are  accepted  as  a  standard  and  with 
more  ‗things‘  available  this  scenario  is  going  to  get  more 
cluttered which requires further research. 

(collision 

free  but 

An  individual  sensor  can  drop  out  for  a  number  of 
reasons, so the network must be self-adapting and allow for 
multi-path routing. Multi-hop routing protocols are used in 
mobile  ad  hoc  networks  and  terrestrial  WSNs  [68].  They 
are  mainly  divided  into  three  categories  -  data  centric, 
location  based  and  hierarchical,  again  based  on  different 
application  domains.  Energy  is  the  main  consideration  for 
the existing routing protocols. In the case of  IoT, it should 
be noted that a backbone  will be available and the number 
of hops in the multi-hop scenario will be limited. In such a 
scenario,  the  existing  routing  protocols  should  suffice  in 
practical implementation with minor modifications. 

7.4. Quality of Service 

7.6. Participatory Sensing 

Heterogeneous  networks  are  (by  default)  multi-service; 
providing  more  than  one  distinct  application  or  service. 
This  implies  not  only  multiple  traffic  types  within  the 
network, but also the ability of a single network to support 
all  applications  without  QoS  compromise  [60].  There  are 
two  application  classes:  throughput  and  delay  tolerant 
elastic traffic of (e.g. monitoring weather parameters at low 
sampling  rates),  and  the  bandwidth  and  delay  sensitive 
inelastic (real-time) traffic (e.g. noise or traffic monitoring), 
which  can  be  further  discriminated  by  data-related 
applications  (e.g.  high-vs.-low  resolution  videos)  with 
different  QoS  requirements.  Therefore,  a  controlled, 
optimal  approach  to  serve  different  network  traffics,  each 
with  its  own  application  QoS  needs  is  required  [61].  It  is 
not easy to provide QoS guarantees in wireless networks, as 

A  number  of  projects  have  begun  to  address  the 
development  of  people  centric  (or  participatory)  sensing 
platforms  [51,62-64].  As  noted  earlier,  people  centric 
sensing  offers  the  possibility  of  low  cost  sensing  of  the 
environment localized to the user. It can therefore give the 
closest indication of environmental parameters experienced 
by  the  user.  It  has  been  noted  that  environmental  data 
collected by  user forms a social currency [65]. This results 
in  more  timely  data  being  generated  compared  to  the  data 
available  through  a  fixed  infrastructure  sensor  network. 
Most  importantly,  it  is  the  opportunity  for  the  user  to 
provide 
their  experience  of  a  given 
environmental parameter that offers valuable information in 
the form of context associated with a given event.

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for

enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth,

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9

amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature

interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user.

framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is –

platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface. 

system 

for 

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

of  its  impact  on  mobility,  productivity,  pollution;  and

and provided by local government to city inhabitants. 

includes 

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps 
identify 
suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor 

targets,

unauthorized access. Automatic behavior analysis and event 
detection  (as  part  of  sophisticated  video  analytics)  is  in  its 
infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs 

Figure 4: Conceptual IoT framework with Cloud Computing at the centre 

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research

on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44].

includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The 

requirements 

are

autonomic  manager,  while  the  managers  effectors  will 
control  Scheduling  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  From  a 
logical  point  of  view  the  two  components  that  will  mostly 
take advantage from the introduction of autonomic features 
in  Aneka  are  the  application  scheduler  and  the  dynamic 
resource provisioning. 

5.2. Application scheduler and Dynamic Resource 
Provisioning in Aneka for IoT applications 

The  Aneka  scheduler  is  responsible  for  assigning  each 
resource to a task in an application  for execution based on 
user  QoS  parameters  and  the  overall  cost  for  the  service 
provider.  Depending  on 
the  computation  and  data 
requirements  of  each  Sensor  Application,  it  directs  the 
dynamic  resource-provisioning  component  to  instantiate  or 
terminate  a  specified  number  of  computing,  storage,  and 
network resources while maintaining a queue of tasks to be 
scheduled.  This  logic  is  embedded  as  multi-objective 
application scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is able to 
mange  resource  failures  by  reallocting  those  tasks  to  other 
suitable Cloud resources.

based 

on 

environments 

The  Dynamic  Resource  Provisioning  component 
implements  the  logic  for  provisioning  and  managing 
virtualised  resources  in  the  private  and  public  cloud 
computing 
resource 
requirements as directed by the application scheduler. This 
is  achieved  by  dynamically  negotiating  with  the  Cloud 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  providers  for  the  right 
kind  of  resource  for  a  certain  time  and  cost  by  taking  into 
account  the  past  execution  history  of  applications  and 
budget availability. This decision is made at run-time, when 
SaaS applications continuously send requests  to the  Aneka 
cloud platform [47]. 

the 

6. IoT Sensor Data Analytics SaaS using Aneka and 
Microsoft Azure 

 Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform,  offered  by 
Microsoft,  includes  four  components  as  summarized  in 
[46].  There  are  several  advantages  for  integrating  Azure 
and  Aneka.  Aneka  can  launch  any  number  of  instances  on 
the  Azure  cloud  to  run  their  applications.  Essentially,  it 
provides  the  provisioning  infrastructure.  Similarly,  Aneka 

 

provides  advanced  PaaS  features  as  shown  in  Figure  5.  It 
provides  multiple  programming  models  (Task,  Thread, 
MapReduce), 
services,  workload 
management  services,  dynamic  provisioning,  QoS  based 
scheduling and flexible billing.

As  discussed  earlier,  trealizese  thubicompmp  vision, 
tools  and  data  needs  to  be  shared  between  application 
developers to create new apps. There are two major hurdles 
in  such  an  implementation.  Firstly,  interaction  between 
clouds becomes critical which is addressed by Aneka in the 
InterCloud  model.  Aneka  support  for  InterCloud  model 
enables 
the  creation  of  a  hybrid  Cloud  computing 
environment  which  combines  the  resources  of  private  and 
public Clouds. That is, whenever private Cloud is unable to 
meet  application  QoS  requirements,  Aneka  leases  extra 
capability  from  public  Cloud  to  ensure  that  application  is 
able  to  execute  within  a  specified  deadline  in  a  seamless 
manner  [47].  Secondly,  data  analytics  and  artificial 

intelligence  tools  are  computationally  demanding  which 
requires  huge  resources.  For  data  analytics  and  artificial 
intelligence  tools,  the  Aneka  task  programming  model 
provides  the  ability  of  expressing  applications  as  a 
collection  of  independent  tasks.  Each  task  can  perform 
different  operations,  or  the  same  operation  on  different 
data,  and  can  be  executed  in  any  order  by  the  runtime 
environment.  In  order  to  demonstrate  this,  we  have  used  a 
scenario  where  there  are  multiple  analytics  algorithm  and 
multiple  data  sources.  A  schematic  of  the  interaction 
between  Aneka  and  Azure  is  given  in  Figure  6  where 
Aneka  Worker  Containers  are  deployed  as  instances  of 
Azure  Worker  Role.  The  Aneka  Master  Container  will  be 
deployed  in  the  on-premises  private  cloud,  while  Aneka 
Worker  Containers  will  be  run  as  instances  of  Microsoft 
Azure  Worker  Role.  As  shown  in  the  Figure  6,  there  are 
two  types  of  Microsoft  Azure  Worker  Roles  used.  These 
are  the  Aneka  Worker  Role  and  Message  Proxy  Role.  In 
this  case,  one  instance  of  the  Message  Proxy  Role  and  at 
least one instance of the Aneka Worker Role are deployed. 
The  maximum  number  of  instances  of  the  Aneka  Worker 
Role  that  can  be  launched  is  limited  by  the  subscription 
offer of Microsoft Azure Service that a user selects. In this 
deployment scenario, when a user submits an application to 
the  Aneka  Master,  the  job  units  will  be  scheduled  by  the 
Aneka  Master  by  leveraging  on-premises  Aneka  Workers, 
if  they  exist,  and  Aneka  Worker  instances  on  Microsoft 
Azure  simultaneously.  When  Aneka  Workers  finish  the 
execution  of  Aneka  work  units,  they  will  send  the  results

back to Aneka Master, and then Aneka Master will send the 
result back to the user application. 

7. Open Challenges and Future Directions 

The  proposed  Cloud  centric  vision  comprises  of  a 
flexible  and  open  architecture  that  is  user  centric  and 
enables different players to interact in the IoT framework. It 
allows  interaction  in  a  manner  suitable  for  their  own 
requirements, rather than the IoT being thrust upon them. In 
this  way,  the  framework  includes  provisions  to  meet 
different requirements for data ownership, security, privacy, 
and sharing of information.  

Some  open  challenges  are  discussed  based  on  the  IoT 
elements  presented  earlier.  The  challenges  include  IoT 
specific  challenges  such  as  privacy,  participatory  sensing, 
data  analytics,  GIS  based  visualization  and  Cloud 
computing  apart  from  the  standard  WSN  challenges 
including 
security, 
protocols,  and  Quality  of  Service.  The  end  goal  is  to  have 
Plug  n‘  Play  smart  objects  which  can  be  deployed  in  any 
environment with an interoperable backbone allowing them 
to  blend  with  other 
them. 
Standardization  of  frequency  bands  and  protocols  plays  a 
pivotal role in accomplishing this goal.

A  roadmap  of  key  developments  in  IoT  research  in  the 
context  of  pervasive  applications  is  shown  in  Figure  8, 
which  includes  the  technology  drivers  and  key  application 
outcomes expected in the next decade [8]. The section ends 
with  a  few  international  initiatives  in  the  domain  which 
could  play  a  vital  role  in  the  success  of  this  rapidly 
emerging technology. 

7.1. Architecture 

the  challenges  particularly 

Overall architecture followed at the initial stages of  IoT 
research  will  have  a  severe  bearing  on  the  field  itself  and 
needs  to  be  investigated.  Most  of  the  work  relating  to  IoT 
architecture  has  been  from  the  wireless  sensor  networks 
perspective [48]. European Union projects of SENSEI [49] 
and Internet of Things-Architecture (IoT-A) [50] have been 
addressing 
from  WSN 
perspective and  have been very successful  for defining the 
architecture  for  different  applications.  We  are  referring 
architecture  to  overall  IoT  where  the  user  is  at  the  center 
and will enable the use of data and infrastructure to develop 
new  applications.  An  architecture  based  on  cloud 
computing  at  the  center  has  been  proposed  in  this  paper. 
However,  this  may  not  be  the  best  option  for  every 
application  domain  particularly  for  defense  where  human 
intelligence  is  relied  upon.  Although  we  see  cloud  centric 
architecture  to  be  the  best  where  cost  based  services  are 
required,  other  architectures  should  be  investigated  for 
different application domains. 

feature 

Another 

required 

important 

for  seamless 
independent IoT working architecture is SaaS to be updated 
by  the  developers  dynamically.  In  this  example,  analytics 
tools (usually in the form of DLLs) have to be updated and 
used  by  several  clients.  Due  to  administrative  privileges 
provided  by  Azure,  this  becomes  a  non-trivial  task. 
Management  Extensibility  Framework  (MEF)  provides  a 
simple solution to the problem. The MEF is a composition 
layer for .NET that improves the flexibility, maintainability 
and  testability  of  large  applications.  MEF  can  be  used  for 
third-party plugin, or it can bring the benefits of a loosely-
coupled  plugin-like  architecture  for  regular  applications.  It 
is a library for creating lightweight, extensible applications. 
It  allows  application  developers  to  discover  and  use 
extensions  with  no  configuration  required.  It  also  lets 
extension  developers  easily  encapsulate  code  and  avoid 
fragile hard dependencies. MEF not only allows extensions 
to be reused  within applications, but across applications as 
well. MEF provides a standard way for the host application 
to  expose 
itself  and  consume  external  extensions. 
Extensions, by their nature, can be reused amongst different 
applications.  However,  an  extension  could  still  be 
implemented  in  a  way  that  is  application-specific.  The 
extensions themselves can depend on one another and MEF 
will make sure they are wired together in the correct order. 
One  of  the  key  design  goals  of  IoT  web  application  is,  it 
would  be  extensible  and  MEF  provides  this  solution.  With 
MEF  we  can  use  different  algorithms  (as  and  when  it 
becomes  available)  for  IoT  data  analytics:  e.g.  drop  an 

Figure 7: System Context Diagram 

analytics  assembly  into  a  folder  and  it  instantly  becomes 
available to the application. The system context diagram of 
the developed data analytics is given in Figure 7.

environment  needs  to  simultaneously  meet  competing 
demands  of  multiple  sensing  modalities.  This  has 
implications  on  network  traffic,  data  storage  and  energy 
utilization.  Importantly,  this  encompasses  both  fixed  and 
mobile sensing infrastructure [51] as well as continuous and 
random sampling. A generalized framework is required for 
data  collection  and  modelling  that  effectively  exploits 
spatial and temporal characteristics of the data, both in the 
sensing  domain  as  well  as  the  associated  transform 
domains.  For  example,  urban  noise  mapping  needs  an 
uninterrupted  collection  of  noise  levels  using  battery 
powered  nodes  using  fixed  infrastructure  and  participatory 
sensing  [51]  as  a  key  component  for  health  and  quality  of 
life services for its inhabitants.

ubiquitous  sensing  context,  this  has  implications  for  data 
compression, network traffic and the distribution of sensors. 
Compressive  wireless  sensing  (CWS)  utilizes  synchronous 
communication  to  reduce  the  transmission  power  of  each 
sensor  [53];  transmitting  noisy  projections  of  data  samples 
to a central location for aggregation. 

7.3. Secure reprogrammable networks and Privacy 

Security will be a major concern wherever networks are 
deployed at large scale. There can be many ways the system 
could  be  attacked  -  disabling  the  network  availability; 
pushing erroneous data into the network; accessing personal 
information;  etc.  The  three  physical  components  of  IoT  - 
RFID,  WSN  and  cloud  are  vulnerable  to  such  attacks. 
Security is critical to any network [54,55] and the first line 
of defence against data corruption is cryptography. 

Of the three, RFID (particularly passive) seems to be the 
most  vulnerable as it allows  person tracking as  well as  the 

 

objects  and  no  high  level  intelligence  can  be  enabled  on 
these devices [15]. These complex problems however have 
solutions  which  can  be  provided  using  cryptographic 
methods and deserves more research before they are widely 
accepted. 

nodes 

Against  outsider  attackers,  encryption  ensures  data 
confidentiality,  whereas  message  authentication  codes 
ensure  data  integrity  and  authenticity  [56].  Encryption, 
however, does not protect against insider malicious attacks, 
to  address  which  non-cryptographic  means  are  needed, 
particularly  in  WSNs.  Also,  periodically,  new  sensor 
applications need to be installed, or existing ones need to be 
updated. This is done by remote wireless reprogramming of 
all 
network 
reprogramming  consists  solely  of  a  data  dissemination 
protocol that distributes code to all the nodes in the network 
without authentication, which is a security threat. A secure 
reprogramming  protocol  allows  the  nodes  to  authenticate 
every code update and prevent malicious installation. Most 
such  protocols  (e.g.,  [57])  are  based  on  the  benchmark 
protocol  Deluge  [58].  We  need  cryptographic  add-ons  to 
Deluge  which  lays  foundation  for  more  sophisticated 
algorithms to be developed. 

network.  Traditional

the 

Security  in  the  cloud  is  another  important  area  of 
research  which  will  need  more  attention.  Along  with  the 
presence  of  the  data  and  tools,  cloud  also  handles 
economics  of  IoT  which  will  make  it  a  bigger  threat  from 
attackers.  Security  and  identity  protection  becomes  critical 
in  hybrid  clouds  where  a  private  as  well  as  public  clouds 
will be used by businesses [59]. 

Remembering forever in the context of IoT raises many 
privacy issues as the data collected can be used in positive 
(for  advertisement  services)  and  negative  ways  (for 
defamation).  Digital  forgetting  could  emerge  as  one  of  the 
key  areas  of  research  to  address  the  concerns  and  the 
development  of  appropriate  framework  to  protect  personal 
data [44]. 

segments  often  constitute  ‗gaps‘  in  resource  guarantee  due 
to resource allocation and management ability constraints in 
shared  wireless  media.  Quality  of  Service 
in  cloud 
Computing  is  another  major  research  area  which  will 
require  more  and  more  attention  as  the  data  and  tools 
become  available  on  clouds.  Dynamic  scheduling  and 
resource  allocation  algorithms  based  on  particle  swarm 
optimization  are  being  developed.  For  high  capacity 
applications  and  as  IoT  grows,  this  could  become  a 
bottleneck. 

7.5. New protocols 

The  protocols  at  the  sensing  end  of  IoT  will  play  a  key 
role  in  complete  realisation.  They  form  the  backbone  for 
the data tunnel between sensors and the outer world. For the 
system  to  work  efficiently,  and  energy  efficient  MAC 
protocol  and  appropriate  routing  protocol  are  critical. 
Several  MAC  protocols  have  been  proposed  for  various 
domains  with  TDMA  (collision  free),  CSMA  (low  traffic 
efficiency)  and  FDMA 
requires 
additional circuitry in nodes) schemes available to the user 
[67].  None  of  them  are  accepted  as  a  standard  and  with 
more  ‗things‘  available  this  scenario  is  going  to  get  more 
cluttered which requires further research. 

(collision 

free  but 

An  individual  sensor  can  drop  out  for  a  number  of 
reasons, so the network must be self-adapting and allow for 
multi-path routing. Multi-hop routing protocols are used in 
mobile  ad  hoc  networks  and  terrestrial  WSNs  [68].  They 
are  mainly  divided  into  three  categories  -  data  centric, 
location  based  and  hierarchical,  again  based  on  different 
application  domains.  Energy  is  the  main  consideration  for 
the existing routing protocols. In the case of  IoT, it should 
be noted that a backbone  will be available and the number 
of hops in the multi-hop scenario will be limited. In such a 
scenario,  the  existing  routing  protocols  should  suffice  in 
practical implementation with minor modifications. 

7.4. Quality of Service 

7.6. Participatory Sensing 

Heterogeneous  networks  are  (by  default)  multi-service; 
providing  more  than  one  distinct  application  or  service. 
This  implies  not  only  multiple  traffic  types  within  the 
network, but also the ability of a single network to support 
all  applications  without  QoS  compromise  [60].  There  are 
two  application  classes:  throughput  and  delay  tolerant 
elastic traffic of (e.g. monitoring weather parameters at low 
sampling  rates),  and  the  bandwidth  and  delay  sensitive 
inelastic (real-time) traffic (e.g. noise or traffic monitoring), 
which  can  be  further  discriminated  by  data-related 
applications  (e.g.  high-vs.-low  resolution  videos)  with 
different  QoS  requirements.  Therefore,  a  controlled, 
optimal  approach  to  serve  different  network  traffics,  each 
with  its  own  application  QoS  needs  is  required  [61].  It  is 
not easy to provide QoS guarantees in wireless networks, as 

A  number  of  projects  have  begun  to  address  the 
development  of  people  centric  (or  participatory)  sensing 
platforms  [51,62-64].  As  noted  earlier,  people  centric 
sensing  offers  the  possibility  of  low  cost  sensing  of  the 
environment localized to the user. It can therefore give the 
closest indication of environmental parameters experienced 
by  the  user.  It  has  been  noted  that  environmental  data 
collected by  user forms a social currency [65]. This results 
in  more  timely  data  being  generated  compared  to  the  data 
available  through  a  fixed  infrastructure  sensor  network. 
Most  importantly,  it  is  the  opportunity  for  the  user  to 
provide 
their  experience  of  a  given 
environmental parameter that offers valuable information in 
the form of context associated with a given event. 

feedback  on

The  limitations  of  people  centric  sensing  place  new 
significance  on  the reference  data role provided by a  fixed 
infrastructure  IoT  as  a  backbone.  The  problem  of  missing 
samples  is  a  fundamental  limitation  of  people  centric 
sensing.  Relying  on  users  volunteering  data  and  on  the 
inconsistent  gathering  of  samples  obtained  across  varying 
times  and  varying  locations  (based  on  a  user's  desired 
participation  and  given  location  or  travel  path),  limits  the 
ability to produce meaningful data for any applications and 
policy decisions. Only in addressing issues and implications 
of  data  ownership,  privacy  and  appropriate  participation 
incentives,  can  such  a  platform  achieve  genuine  end-user 
engagement.  Further  sensing  modalities  can  be  obtained 
through  the  addition  of  sensor  modules  attached  to  the 
phone  for  application  specific  sensing,  such  as  air  quality 
sensors  [66]  or  biometric  sensors.  In  such  scenarios,  smart 
phones  become  critical  IoT  nodes  which  are  connected  to 
the cloud on one end and several sensors at the other end. 

7.7. Data mining 

Extracting  useful  information  from  a  complex  sensing 
environment at different spatial and temporal resolutions is 
a  challenging  research  problem  in  artificial  intelligence. 
Current  state-of-the-art  methods  use  shallow  learning 
methods  where  pre-defined  events  and  data  anomalies  are 
extracted  using  supervised  and  unsupervised  learning  [69]. 
The next level of learning involves inferring local activities 
by  using  temporal  information  of  events  extracted  from 
shallow  learning.  The  ultimate  vision  will  be  to  detect 
complex events based on larger spatial and longer temporal 
scales  based  on  the  two  levels  before.  The  fundamental 
research  problem 
sensing 
environments of this nature is how to simultaneously learn 
representations of events and activities at multiple levels of 
complexity  (i.e.,  events,  local  activities  and  complex 
activities). An emerging focus in machine learning research 
has been the field of deep learning [70], which aims to learn 
multiple  layers  of  abstraction  that  can  be  used  to  interpret 
given  data.  Furthermore,  the  resource  constraints  in  sensor 
networks create novel challenges for deep learning in terms 
of  the  need  for  adaptive,  distributed  and  incremental 
learning techniques.

As  new  display 

creative 
visualization  will  be  enabled.  The  evolution  from  CRT  to 
Plasma,  LCD,  LED,  and  AMOLED  displays  have  given 
rise  to  highly  efficient  data  representation  (using  touch 
interface)  with  the  user  being  able  to  navigate  the  data 
better  than  ever  before.  With  emerging  3D  displays,  this 
area  is  certain  to  have  more  research  and  development 
opportunities.  However,  the  data  which  comes  out  of 
ubiquitous  computing  is  not  always  ready  for  direct

consumption  using  visualization  platforms  and  requires 
further processing. The scenario becomes very complex for 
heterogeneous spatio-temporal data [71]. New visualization 
schemes  for representation of heterogeneous sensors in 3D 
landscape that varies temporally have to be developed [72]. 
Another  challenge  of  visualizing  data  collected  within  IoT 
is that they are geo-related and are sparsely distributed. To 
cope with such a challenge, a framework based on Internet 
GIS is required. 

7.9. Cloud Computing 

An  integrated  IoT  and  Cloud  computing  applications  
enabling the creation of smart environments such as Smart 
Cities  need  to  be  able  to  (a)  combine  services  offered  by 
multiple  stakeholders  and  (b)  scale  to  support  a  large 
number  of  users  in  a  reliable  and  decentralized  manner. 
They  need  to  be  able  operate  in  both  wired  and  wireless 
network  environments  and  deal  with  constraints  such  as 
access  devices  or  data  sources  with  limited  power  and 
unreliable  connectivity.  The  Cloud  application  platforms 
need  to  be  enhanced  to  support  (a)  the  rapid  creation  of 
applications  by  providing  domain  specific  programming 
tools  and  environments  and  (b)  seamless  execution  of 
applications  harnessing  capabilities  of  multiple  dynamic 
and  heterogeneous  resources  to  meet  quality  of  service 
requirements of diverse users.  

The Cloud resource management and scheduling system 
should  be  able  to  dynamically  prioritize    requests  and 
provision resources such that critical requests are served in 
real  time.  To  deliver  results  in  a  reliable  manner,  the 
scheduler  needs  to  be  augmented  with  task  duplication 
algorithms  for failure  management. Specifically, the  Cloud 
application  scheduling  algorithms  need  to  exhibit  the 
following capability: 
1.  Multi-objective optimization: The scheduling algorithms 
should  be  able  to  deal  with  QoS  parameters  such  as 
response  time,  cost  of  service  usage,  maximum  number 
of  resources  available  per  unit  price,  and  penalties  for 
service degradation.  

2.  Task  duplication  based  fault  tolerance:  Critical  tasks  of 
an  application  will  be  transparently  replicated  and 
executed  on  different  resources  so  that  if  one  resource 
fails  to  complete  the  task,  the  replicated  version  can  be 
used. This logic is crucial in real-time tasks that need to 
be processed to deliver services in a timely manner.   

7.10. International Activities 

Internet  of  Things  activities  is  gathering  momentum 
around  the  world,  with  numerous  initiatives  underway 
across 
levels  of 
government,  as  key  stakeholders  seek  to  map  a  way 
forward for the coordinated realization of this technological 
evolution.  In  Europe,  substantial  effort  is  underway  to

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

Frequency  IDentification  (RFID)  and  sensor  network 
technologies will rise to meet this new challenge, in which 
information  and  communication  systems  are  invisibly 
embedded in the environment around us. This results in the 
generation  of  enormous  amounts  of  data  which  have  to  be 
stored, processed and presented in a seamless, efficient and

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

is  an 
indispensable  part  of  IoT.  With  the  growing  presence  of 
WiFi  and  4G-LTE  wireless  Internet  access,  the  evolution 
toward  ubiquitous 
communication 
networks  is  already  evident.  However,  for  the  Internet  of 
Things  vision  to  successfully  emerge,  the  computing 
criterion  will  need  to  go  beyond  traditional  mobile 
computing  scenarios  that  use  smart  phones  and  portables, 
and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and 
embedding 
into  our  environment.  For 
technology to disappear from the consciousness of the user, 
the Internet of Things demands: (1) a shared understanding 
of  the  situation  of  its  users  and  their  appliances,  (2)

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator 
nodes, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is on the verge 
of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully 
integrated Future Internet [1]. Internet revolution led to the 
interconnection  between  people  at  an  unprecedented  scale 
and  pace.  The  next  revolution  will  be  the  interconnection 
between  objects  to  create  a  smart  environment.  Only  in

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile 
network operators alone spanning vertical segments such as 
health,  automotive,  utilities  and  consumer  electronics.  A 
schematic  of  the  interconnection  of  objects  is  depicted  in

on the  scale of the impact of  the data generated. The users

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality 
of Service parameters.

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically,

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface. 

system

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

flexibility to make changes to the setup whenever required.

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

of  its  impact  on  mobility,  productivity,  pollution;  and

and provided by local government to city inhabitants. 

includes 

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps 
identify 
suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor

detection  (as  part  of  sophisticated  video  analytics)  is  in  its 
infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs 

Figure 4: Conceptual IoT framework with Cloud Computing at the centre 

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research

problems  that can be addressed include vehicle  travel  time 
on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44]. 

logistics  management 

Another  important  application  in  mobile  IoT  domain  is 
efficient 
includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise 
domain  but  transport  planning  is  carried  out  using  a  large 
scale IoT network.  

[39].  This 

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The 

requirements 

are

autonomic  manager,  while  the  managers  effectors  will 
control  Scheduling  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  From  a 
logical  point  of  view  the  two  components  that  will  mostly 
take advantage from the introduction of autonomic features 
in  Aneka  are  the  application  scheduler  and  the  dynamic 
resource provisioning. 

5.2. Application scheduler and Dynamic Resource 
Provisioning in Aneka for IoT applications 

The  Aneka  scheduler  is  responsible  for  assigning  each 
resource to a task in an application  for execution based on 
user  QoS  parameters  and  the  overall  cost  for  the  service 
provider.  Depending  on 
the  computation  and  data 
requirements  of  each  Sensor  Application,  it  directs  the 
dynamic  resource-provisioning  component  to  instantiate  or 
terminate  a  specified  number  of  computing,  storage,  and 
network resources while maintaining a queue of tasks to be 
scheduled.  This  logic  is  embedded  as  multi-objective 
application scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is able to 
mange  resource  failures  by  reallocting  those  tasks  to  other 
suitable Cloud resources.

based 

on 

environments 

The  Dynamic  Resource  Provisioning  component 
implements  the  logic  for  provisioning  and  managing 
virtualised  resources  in  the  private  and  public  cloud 
computing 
resource 
requirements as directed by the application scheduler. This 
is  achieved  by  dynamically  negotiating  with  the  Cloud 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  providers  for  the  right 
kind  of  resource  for  a  certain  time  and  cost  by  taking  into 
account  the  past  execution  history  of  applications  and 
budget availability. This decision is made at run-time, when 
SaaS applications continuously send requests  to the  Aneka 
cloud platform [47]. 

the 

6. IoT Sensor Data Analytics SaaS using Aneka and 
Microsoft Azure 

 Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform,  offered  by 
Microsoft,  includes  four  components  as  summarized  in 
[46].  There  are  several  advantages  for  integrating  Azure 
and  Aneka.  Aneka  can  launch  any  number  of  instances  on 
the  Azure  cloud  to  run  their  applications.  Essentially,  it 
provides  the  provisioning  infrastructure.  Similarly,  Aneka 

 

provides  advanced  PaaS  features  as  shown  in  Figure  5.  It 
provides  multiple  programming  models  (Task,  Thread, 
MapReduce), 
services,  workload 
management  services,  dynamic  provisioning,  QoS  based 
scheduling and flexible billing.

As  discussed  earlier,  trealizese  thubicompmp  vision, 
tools  and  data  needs  to  be  shared  between  application 
developers to create new apps. There are two major hurdles 
in  such  an  implementation.  Firstly,  interaction  between 
clouds becomes critical which is addressed by Aneka in the 
InterCloud  model.  Aneka  support  for  InterCloud  model 
enables 
the  creation  of  a  hybrid  Cloud  computing 
environment  which  combines  the  resources  of  private  and 
public Clouds. That is, whenever private Cloud is unable to 
meet  application  QoS  requirements,  Aneka  leases  extra 
capability  from  public  Cloud  to  ensure  that  application  is 
able  to  execute  within  a  specified  deadline  in  a  seamless 
manner  [47].  Secondly,  data  analytics  and  artificial 

intelligence  tools  are  computationally  demanding  which 
requires  huge  resources.  For  data  analytics  and  artificial 
intelligence  tools,  the  Aneka  task  programming  model 
provides  the  ability  of  expressing  applications  as  a 
collection  of  independent  tasks.  Each  task  can  perform 
different  operations,  or  the  same  operation  on  different 
data,  and  can  be  executed  in  any  order  by  the  runtime 
environment.  In  order  to  demonstrate  this,  we  have  used  a 
scenario  where  there  are  multiple  analytics  algorithm  and 
multiple  data  sources.  A  schematic  of  the  interaction 
between  Aneka  and  Azure  is  given  in  Figure  6  where 
Aneka  Worker  Containers  are  deployed  as  instances  of 
Azure  Worker  Role.  The  Aneka  Master  Container  will  be 
deployed  in  the  on-premises  private  cloud,  while  Aneka 
Worker  Containers  will  be  run  as  instances  of  Microsoft 
Azure  Worker  Role.  As  shown  in  the  Figure  6,  there  are 
two  types  of  Microsoft  Azure  Worker  Roles  used.  These 
are  the  Aneka  Worker  Role  and  Message  Proxy  Role.  In 
this  case,  one  instance  of  the  Message  Proxy  Role  and  at 
least one instance of the Aneka Worker Role are deployed. 
The  maximum  number  of  instances  of  the  Aneka  Worker 
Role  that  can  be  launched  is  limited  by  the  subscription 
offer of Microsoft Azure Service that a user selects. In this 
deployment scenario, when a user submits an application to 
the  Aneka  Master,  the  job  units  will  be  scheduled  by  the 
Aneka  Master  by  leveraging  on-premises  Aneka  Workers, 
if  they  exist,  and  Aneka  Worker  instances  on  Microsoft 
Azure  simultaneously.  When  Aneka  Workers  finish  the 
execution  of  Aneka  work  units,  they  will  send  the  results

back to Aneka Master, and then Aneka Master will send the 
result back to the user application. 

7. Open Challenges and Future Directions 

The  proposed  Cloud  centric  vision  comprises  of  a 
flexible  and  open  architecture  that  is  user  centric  and 
enables different players to interact in the IoT framework. It 
allows  interaction  in  a  manner  suitable  for  their  own 
requirements, rather than the IoT being thrust upon them. In 
this  way,  the  framework  includes  provisions  to  meet 
different requirements for data ownership, security, privacy, 
and sharing of information.  

Some  open  challenges  are  discussed  based  on  the  IoT 
elements  presented  earlier.  The  challenges  include  IoT 
specific  challenges  such  as  privacy,  participatory  sensing, 
data  analytics,  GIS  based  visualization  and  Cloud 
computing  apart  from  the  standard  WSN  challenges 
including 
security, 
protocols,  and  Quality  of  Service.  The  end  goal  is  to  have 
Plug  n‘  Play  smart  objects  which  can  be  deployed  in  any 
environment with an interoperable backbone allowing them 
to  blend  with  other 
them. 
Standardization  of  frequency  bands  and  protocols  plays  a 
pivotal role in accomplishing this goal.

A  roadmap  of  key  developments  in  IoT  research  in  the 
context  of  pervasive  applications  is  shown  in  Figure  8, 
which  includes  the  technology  drivers  and  key  application 
outcomes expected in the next decade [8]. The section ends 
with  a  few  international  initiatives  in  the  domain  which 
could  play  a  vital  role  in  the  success  of  this  rapidly 
emerging technology. 

7.1. Architecture 

the  challenges  particularly 

Overall architecture followed at the initial stages of  IoT 
research  will  have  a  severe  bearing  on  the  field  itself  and 
needs  to  be  investigated.  Most  of  the  work  relating  to  IoT 
architecture  has  been  from  the  wireless  sensor  networks 
perspective [48]. European Union projects of SENSEI [49] 
and Internet of Things-Architecture (IoT-A) [50] have been 
addressing 
from  WSN 
perspective and  have been very successful  for defining the 
architecture  for  different  applications.  We  are  referring 
architecture  to  overall  IoT  where  the  user  is  at  the  center 
and will enable the use of data and infrastructure to develop 
new  applications.  An  architecture  based  on  cloud 
computing  at  the  center  has  been  proposed  in  this  paper. 
However,  this  may  not  be  the  best  option  for  every 
application  domain  particularly  for  defense  where  human 
intelligence  is  relied  upon.  Although  we  see  cloud  centric 
architecture  to  be  the  best  where  cost  based  services  are 
required,  other  architectures  should  be  investigated  for 
different application domains. 

feature 

Another 

required 

important 

for  seamless 
independent IoT working architecture is SaaS to be updated 
by  the  developers  dynamically.  In  this  example,  analytics 
tools (usually in the form of DLLs) have to be updated and 
used  by  several  clients.  Due  to  administrative  privileges 
provided  by  Azure,  this  becomes  a  non-trivial  task. 
Management  Extensibility  Framework  (MEF)  provides  a 
simple solution to the problem. The MEF is a composition 
layer for .NET that improves the flexibility, maintainability 
and  testability  of  large  applications.  MEF  can  be  used  for 
third-party plugin, or it can bring the benefits of a loosely-
coupled  plugin-like  architecture  for  regular  applications.  It 
is a library for creating lightweight, extensible applications. 
It  allows  application  developers  to  discover  and  use 
extensions  with  no  configuration  required.  It  also  lets 
extension  developers  easily  encapsulate  code  and  avoid 
fragile hard dependencies. MEF not only allows extensions 
to be reused  within applications, but across applications as 
well. MEF provides a standard way for the host application 
to  expose 
itself  and  consume  external  extensions. 
Extensions, by their nature, can be reused amongst different 
applications.  However,  an  extension  could  still  be 
implemented  in  a  way  that  is  application-specific.  The 
extensions themselves can depend on one another and MEF 
will make sure they are wired together in the correct order. 
One  of  the  key  design  goals  of  IoT  web  application  is,  it 
would  be  extensible  and  MEF  provides  this  solution.  With 
MEF  we  can  use  different  algorithms  (as  and  when  it 
becomes  available)  for  IoT  data  analytics:  e.g.  drop  an 

Figure 7: System Context Diagram 

analytics  assembly  into  a  folder  and  it  instantly  becomes 
available to the application. The system context diagram of 
the developed data analytics is given in Figure 7.

environment  needs  to  simultaneously  meet  competing 
demands  of  multiple  sensing  modalities.  This  has 
implications  on  network  traffic,  data  storage  and  energy 
utilization.  Importantly,  this  encompasses  both  fixed  and 
mobile sensing infrastructure [51] as well as continuous and 
random sampling. A generalized framework is required for 
data  collection  and  modelling  that  effectively  exploits 
spatial and temporal characteristics of the data, both in the 
sensing  domain  as  well  as  the  associated  transform 
domains.  For  example,  urban  noise  mapping  needs  an 
uninterrupted  collection  of  noise  levels  using  battery 
powered  nodes  using  fixed  infrastructure  and  participatory 
sensing  [51]  as  a  key  component  for  health  and  quality  of 
life services for its inhabitants.

finding

ubiquitous  sensing  context,  this  has  implications  for  data 
compression, network traffic and the distribution of sensors. 
Compressive  wireless  sensing  (CWS)  utilizes  synchronous 
communication  to  reduce  the  transmission  power  of  each 
sensor  [53];  transmitting  noisy  projections  of  data  samples 
to a central location for aggregation. 

7.3. Secure reprogrammable networks and Privacy 

Security will be a major concern wherever networks are 
deployed at large scale. There can be many ways the system 
could  be  attacked  -  disabling  the  network  availability; 
pushing erroneous data into the network; accessing personal 
information;  etc.  The  three  physical  components  of  IoT  - 
RFID,  WSN  and  cloud  are  vulnerable  to  such  attacks. 
Security is critical to any network [54,55] and the first line 
of defence against data corruption is cryptography. 

Of the three, RFID (particularly passive) seems to be the 
most  vulnerable as it allows  person tracking as  well as  the 

 

objects  and  no  high  level  intelligence  can  be  enabled  on 
these devices [15]. These complex problems however have 
solutions  which  can  be  provided  using  cryptographic 
methods and deserves more research before they are widely 
accepted. 

nodes 

Against  outsider  attackers,  encryption  ensures  data 
confidentiality,  whereas  message  authentication  codes 
ensure  data  integrity  and  authenticity  [56].  Encryption, 
however, does not protect against insider malicious attacks, 
to  address  which  non-cryptographic  means  are  needed, 
particularly  in  WSNs.  Also,  periodically,  new  sensor 
applications need to be installed, or existing ones need to be 
updated. This is done by remote wireless reprogramming of 
all 
network 
reprogramming  consists  solely  of  a  data  dissemination 
protocol that distributes code to all the nodes in the network 
without authentication, which is a security threat. A secure 
reprogramming  protocol  allows  the  nodes  to  authenticate 
every code update and prevent malicious installation. Most 
such  protocols  (e.g.,  [57])  are  based  on  the  benchmark 
protocol  Deluge  [58].  We  need  cryptographic  add-ons  to 
Deluge  which  lays  foundation  for  more  sophisticated 
algorithms to be developed. 

network.  Traditional

the 

Security  in  the  cloud  is  another  important  area  of 
research  which  will  need  more  attention.  Along  with  the 
presence  of  the  data  and  tools,  cloud  also  handles 
economics  of  IoT  which  will  make  it  a  bigger  threat  from 
attackers.  Security  and  identity  protection  becomes  critical 
in  hybrid  clouds  where  a  private  as  well  as  public  clouds 
will be used by businesses [59]. 

Remembering forever in the context of IoT raises many 
privacy issues as the data collected can be used in positive 
(for  advertisement  services)  and  negative  ways  (for 
defamation).  Digital  forgetting  could  emerge  as  one  of  the 
key  areas  of  research  to  address  the  concerns  and  the 
development  of  appropriate  framework  to  protect  personal 
data [44]. 

segments  often  constitute  ‗gaps‘  in  resource  guarantee  due 
to resource allocation and management ability constraints in 
shared  wireless  media.  Quality  of  Service 
in  cloud 
Computing  is  another  major  research  area  which  will 
require  more  and  more  attention  as  the  data  and  tools 
become  available  on  clouds.  Dynamic  scheduling  and 
resource  allocation  algorithms  based  on  particle  swarm 
optimization  are  being  developed.  For  high  capacity 
applications  and  as  IoT  grows,  this  could  become  a 
bottleneck. 

7.5. New protocols 

The  protocols  at  the  sensing  end  of  IoT  will  play  a  key 
role  in  complete  realisation.  They  form  the  backbone  for 
the data tunnel between sensors and the outer world. For the 
system  to  work  efficiently,  and  energy  efficient  MAC 
protocol  and  appropriate  routing  protocol  are  critical. 
Several  MAC  protocols  have  been  proposed  for  various 
domains  with  TDMA  (collision  free),  CSMA  (low  traffic 
efficiency)  and  FDMA 
requires 
additional circuitry in nodes) schemes available to the user 
[67].  None  of  them  are  accepted  as  a  standard  and  with 
more  ‗things‘  available  this  scenario  is  going  to  get  more 
cluttered which requires further research. 

(collision 

free  but 

An  individual  sensor  can  drop  out  for  a  number  of 
reasons, so the network must be self-adapting and allow for 
multi-path routing. Multi-hop routing protocols are used in 
mobile  ad  hoc  networks  and  terrestrial  WSNs  [68].  They 
are  mainly  divided  into  three  categories  -  data  centric, 
location  based  and  hierarchical,  again  based  on  different 
application  domains.  Energy  is  the  main  consideration  for 
the existing routing protocols. In the case of  IoT, it should 
be noted that a backbone  will be available and the number 
of hops in the multi-hop scenario will be limited. In such a 
scenario,  the  existing  routing  protocols  should  suffice  in 
practical implementation with minor modifications. 

7.4. Quality of Service 

7.6. Participatory Sensing 

Heterogeneous  networks  are  (by  default)  multi-service; 
providing  more  than  one  distinct  application  or  service. 
This  implies  not  only  multiple  traffic  types  within  the 
network, but also the ability of a single network to support 
all  applications  without  QoS  compromise  [60].  There  are 
two  application  classes:  throughput  and  delay  tolerant 
elastic traffic of (e.g. monitoring weather parameters at low 
sampling  rates),  and  the  bandwidth  and  delay  sensitive 
inelastic (real-time) traffic (e.g. noise or traffic monitoring), 
which  can  be  further  discriminated  by  data-related 
applications  (e.g.  high-vs.-low  resolution  videos)  with 
different  QoS  requirements.  Therefore,  a  controlled, 
optimal  approach  to  serve  different  network  traffics,  each 
with  its  own  application  QoS  needs  is  required  [61].  It  is 
not easy to provide QoS guarantees in wireless networks, as 

A  number  of  projects  have  begun  to  address  the 
development  of  people  centric  (or  participatory)  sensing 
platforms  [51,62-64].  As  noted  earlier,  people  centric 
sensing  offers  the  possibility  of  low  cost  sensing  of  the 
environment localized to the user. It can therefore give the 
closest indication of environmental parameters experienced 
by  the  user.  It  has  been  noted  that  environmental  data 
collected by  user forms a social currency [65]. This results 
in  more  timely  data  being  generated  compared  to  the  data 
available  through  a  fixed  infrastructure  sensor  network. 
Most  importantly,  it  is  the  opportunity  for  the  user  to 
provide 
their  experience  of  a  given 
environmental parameter that offers valuable information in 
the form of context associated with a given event.

The  limitations  of  people  centric  sensing  place  new 
significance  on  the reference  data role provided by a  fixed 
infrastructure  IoT  as  a  backbone.  The  problem  of  missing 
samples  is  a  fundamental  limitation  of  people  centric 
sensing.  Relying  on  users  volunteering  data  and  on  the 
inconsistent  gathering  of  samples  obtained  across  varying 
times  and  varying  locations  (based  on  a  user's  desired 
participation  and  given  location  or  travel  path),  limits  the 
ability to produce meaningful data for any applications and 
policy decisions. Only in addressing issues and implications 
of  data  ownership,  privacy  and  appropriate  participation 
incentives,  can  such  a  platform  achieve  genuine  end-user 
engagement.  Further  sensing  modalities  can  be  obtained 
through  the  addition  of  sensor  modules  attached  to  the 
phone  for  application  specific  sensing,  such  as  air  quality 
sensors  [66]  or  biometric  sensors.  In  such  scenarios,  smart 
phones  become  critical  IoT  nodes  which  are  connected  to 
the cloud on one end and several sensors at the other end. 

7.7. Data mining 

Extracting  useful  information  from  a  complex  sensing 
environment at different spatial and temporal resolutions is 
a  challenging  research  problem  in  artificial  intelligence. 
Current  state-of-the-art  methods  use  shallow  learning 
methods  where  pre-defined  events  and  data  anomalies  are 
extracted  using  supervised  and  unsupervised  learning  [69]. 
The next level of learning involves inferring local activities 
by  using  temporal  information  of  events  extracted  from 
shallow  learning.  The  ultimate  vision  will  be  to  detect 
complex events based on larger spatial and longer temporal 
scales  based  on  the  two  levels  before.  The  fundamental 
research  problem 
sensing 
environments of this nature is how to simultaneously learn 
representations of events and activities at multiple levels of 
complexity  (i.e.,  events,  local  activities  and  complex 
activities). An emerging focus in machine learning research 
has been the field of deep learning [70], which aims to learn 
multiple  layers  of  abstraction  that  can  be  used  to  interpret 
given  data.  Furthermore,  the  resource  constraints  in  sensor 
networks create novel challenges for deep learning in terms 
of  the  need  for  adaptive,  distributed  and  incremental 
learning techniques.

7.8. GIS based visualization 

emerge, 

technologies 

As  new  display 

creative 
visualization  will  be  enabled.  The  evolution  from  CRT  to 
Plasma,  LCD,  LED,  and  AMOLED  displays  have  given 
rise  to  highly  efficient  data  representation  (using  touch 
interface)  with  the  user  being  able  to  navigate  the  data 
better  than  ever  before.  With  emerging  3D  displays,  this 
area  is  certain  to  have  more  research  and  development 
opportunities.  However,  the  data  which  comes  out  of 
ubiquitous  computing  is  not  always  ready  for  direct 

 

16 

consumption  using  visualization  platforms  and  requires 
further processing. The scenario becomes very complex for 
heterogeneous spatio-temporal data [71]. New visualization 
schemes  for representation of heterogeneous sensors in 3D 
landscape that varies temporally have to be developed [72]. 
Another  challenge  of  visualizing  data  collected  within  IoT 
is that they are geo-related and are sparsely distributed. To 
cope with such a challenge, a framework based on Internet 
GIS is required. 

7.9. Cloud Computing 

An  integrated  IoT  and  Cloud  computing  applications  
enabling the creation of smart environments such as Smart 
Cities  need  to  be  able  to  (a)  combine  services  offered  by 
multiple  stakeholders  and  (b)  scale  to  support  a  large 
number  of  users  in  a  reliable  and  decentralized  manner. 
They  need  to  be  able  operate  in  both  wired  and  wireless 
network  environments  and  deal  with  constraints  such  as 
access  devices  or  data  sources  with  limited  power  and 
unreliable  connectivity.  The  Cloud  application  platforms 
need  to  be  enhanced  to  support  (a)  the  rapid  creation  of 
applications  by  providing  domain  specific  programming 
tools  and  environments  and  (b)  seamless  execution  of 
applications  harnessing  capabilities  of  multiple  dynamic 
and  heterogeneous  resources  to  meet  quality  of  service 
requirements of diverse users.  

The Cloud resource management and scheduling system 
should  be  able  to  dynamically  prioritize    requests  and 
provision resources such that critical requests are served in 
real  time.  To  deliver  results  in  a  reliable  manner,  the 
scheduler  needs  to  be  augmented  with  task  duplication 
algorithms  for failure  management. Specifically, the  Cloud 
application  scheduling  algorithms  need  to  exhibit  the 
following capability: 
1.  Multi-objective optimization: The scheduling algorithms 
should  be  able  to  deal  with  QoS  parameters  such  as 
response  time,  cost  of  service  usage,  maximum  number 
of  resources  available  per  unit  price,  and  penalties  for 
service degradation.  

2.  Task  duplication  based  fault  tolerance:  Critical  tasks  of 
an  application  will  be  transparently  replicated  and 
executed  on  different  resources  so  that  if  one  resource 
fails  to  complete  the  task,  the  replicated  version  can  be 
used. This logic is crucial in real-time tasks that need to 
be processed to deliver services in a timely manner.   

7.10. International Activities 

Internet  of  Things  activities  is  gathering  momentum 
around  the  world,  with  numerous  initiatives  underway 
across 
levels  of 
government,  as  key  stakeholders  seek  to  map  a  way 
forward for the coordinated realization of this technological 
evolution.  In  Europe,  substantial  effort  is  underway  to 

industry,  academia  and  various 

 

consolidate  the  cross-domain  activities  of  research  groups 
and  organizations,  spanning  M2M,  WSN  and  RFID  into  a 
unified  IoT  framework.  Supported  by 
the  European 
Commission 7thFramework program (EU-FP7) this includes 
the  Internet  of  Things  European  Research  Cluster  (IERC). 
Encompassing a number of EU FP7 projects, its objectives 
are: to establish a cooperation platform and research vision 
for IoT activities in Europe and become a contact point for 
IoT  research  in  the  world.  It  includes  projects  such  as 
CASAGRAS2, a consortium  of international partners  from 
Europe, the USA, China, Japan and Korea exploring issues 
surrounding  RFID  and  its  role  in  realizing  the  Internet  of 
Things.  As  well,  IERC  includes  the  Internet  of  Things 
Architecture  (IoT-A)  project  established  to  determine  an 
architectural  reference  model  for  the  interoperability  of 
Internet-of-Things  systems  and  key  building  blocks  to 
achieve this. At the same time, the IoT Initiative (IoT-i) is a 
coordinated  action  established  to  support  the  development 
of  the  European  IoT  community.  The  IoT-i  project  brings 
together a consortium of partners to create a joint strategic 
and technical vision for the IoT in Europe that encompasses 
the  currently  fragmented  sectors  of  the  IoT  domain 
holistically.  Simultaneously,  the  SmartSantander  project  is 
developing a city scale IoT testbed for research and service 
provision  deployed  across  the  city  of  Santander,  Spain,  as 
well  as  sites  located  in  the  UK,  Germany,  Serbia  and 
Australia. 

At the same time large scale initiatives are underway in 
Japan,  Korea,  the  USA  and  Australia,  where  industry, 
associated  organizations  and  government  departments  are 
collaborating  on  various  programs,  advancing  related 
capabilities  towards  an  IoT.  This  includes  smart  city 
initiatives,  smart  grid  programs 
incorporating  smart 
metering technologies and roll-out of high speed broadband 
infrastructure.  A  continuing  development  of  RFID  related 
technologies by industry and consortiums such as the Auto-
ID  lab  (founded  at  MIT  and  now  with  satellite  labs  at 
leading  universities  in  South  Korea,  China,  Japan,  United 
Kingdom,  Australia and Switzerland) dedicated to creating 
the  Internet  of  Things  using  RFID  and  Wireless  Sensor 
Networks  are  being  pursued.  Significantly,  the  need  for 
consensus  around  IoT  technical  issues  has  seen  the 
establishment  of  the  Internet  Protocol  for  Smart  Objects 
(IPSO)  Alliance,  now  with  more 
than  60  member 
companies  from  leading  technology,  communications  and 
energy  companies,  working  with  standards  bodies,  such  as 
IETF, IEEE and ITU to specify new IP-based technologies 
and  promote  industry  consensus  for  assembling  the  parts 
for  the  Internet  of  Things.  Substantial  IoT  development 
activity is also underway in China, with its 12th Five Year 
Plan 
investment  and 
development  to  be  focused  on:  smart  grid;  intelligent 
transportation;  smart  logistics;  smart  home;  environment 
and safety testing; industrial control and automation; health 
care; fine agriculture; finance and service; military defense.

This  is  being  aided  by  the  establishment  of  an  Internet  of 
Things  center  in  Shanghai  (with  a  total  investment  over 
US$  100million)  to  study  technologies  and  industrial 
standards.  An  industry  fund  for  Internet  of  Things,  and  an 
Internet of Things Union ‗Sensing China‘ has been founded 
in  Wuxi,  initiated  by  more  than  60  telecom  operators, 
institutes and companies who are the primary drivers of the 
industry. 

8. Summary and Conclusions 

The  proliferation  of  devices  with  communicating-
actuating  capabilities  is  bringing  closer  the  vision  of  an 
Internet  of  Things,  where  the  sensing  and  actuation 
functions  seamlessly  blend  into  the  background  and  new 
capabilities  are  made  possible  through  access  of  rich  new 
information  sources.  The  evolution  of  the  next  generation 
mobile system  will depend on the creativity of  the users in 
designing  new  applications.  IoT  is  an  ideal  emerging 
technology  to  influence  this  domain  by  providing  new 
evolving data and the required computational resources  for 
creating revolutionary apps.  

Presented  here  is  a  user-centric  cloud  based  model  for

public clouds. In this manner, the needs of the end-user are 
brought to the fore. Allowing for the necessary flexibility to 
meet  the  diverse  and  sometimes  competing  needs  of 
different  sectors,  we  propose  a  framework  enabled  by  a 
scalable cloud to provide the capacity to utilize the IoT. The

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-

indispensable  part  of  IoT.  With  the  growing  presence  of

toward  ubiquitous

networks  is  already  evident.  However,  for  the  Internet  of

criterion  will  need  to  go  beyond  traditional  mobile 
computing  scenarios  that  use  smart  phones  and  portables, 
and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and 
embedding

technology to disappear from the consciousness of the user, 
the Internet of Things demands: (1) a shared understanding

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator 
nodes, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is on the verge 
of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully 
integrated Future Internet [1]. Internet revolution led to the 
interconnection  between  people  at  an  unprecedented  scale 
and  pace.  The  next  revolution  will  be  the  interconnection

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile 
network operators alone spanning vertical segments such as 
health,  automotive,  utilities  and  consumer  electronics.  A

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things.

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface.

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

of  its  impact  on  mobility,  productivity,  pollution;  and

and provided by local government to city inhabitants. 

includes 

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps 
identify 
suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor

detection  (as  part  of  sophisticated  video  analytics)  is  in  its 
infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs 

Figure 4: Conceptual IoT framework with Cloud Computing at the centre 

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research

problems  that can be addressed include vehicle  travel  time 
on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44]. 

logistics  management 

Another  important  application  in  mobile  IoT  domain  is 
efficient 
includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise 
domain  but  transport  planning  is  carried  out  using  a  large 
scale IoT network.  

[39].  This 

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The 

requirements 

are

autonomic  manager,  while  the  managers  effectors  will 
control  Scheduling  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  From  a 
logical  point  of  view  the  two  components  that  will  mostly 
take advantage from the introduction of autonomic features 
in  Aneka  are  the  application  scheduler  and  the  dynamic 
resource provisioning. 

5.2. Application scheduler and Dynamic Resource 
Provisioning in Aneka for IoT applications 

The  Aneka  scheduler  is  responsible  for  assigning  each 
resource to a task in an application  for execution based on 
user  QoS  parameters  and  the  overall  cost  for  the  service 
provider.  Depending  on 
the  computation  and  data 
requirements  of  each  Sensor  Application,  it  directs  the 
dynamic  resource-provisioning  component  to  instantiate  or 
terminate  a  specified  number  of  computing,  storage,  and 
network resources while maintaining a queue of tasks to be 
scheduled.  This  logic  is  embedded  as  multi-objective 
application scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is able to 
mange  resource  failures  by  reallocting  those  tasks  to  other 
suitable Cloud resources.  

 

11 

based 

on 

environments 

The  Dynamic  Resource  Provisioning  component 
implements  the  logic  for  provisioning  and  managing 
virtualised  resources  in  the  private  and  public  cloud 
computing 
resource 
requirements as directed by the application scheduler. This 
is  achieved  by  dynamically  negotiating  with  the  Cloud 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  providers  for  the  right 
kind  of  resource  for  a  certain  time  and  cost  by  taking  into 
account  the  past  execution  history  of  applications  and 
budget availability. This decision is made at run-time, when 
SaaS applications continuously send requests  to the  Aneka 
cloud platform [47]. 

the 

6. IoT Sensor Data Analytics SaaS using Aneka and 
Microsoft Azure 

 Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform,  offered  by 
Microsoft,  includes  four  components  as  summarized  in 
[46].  There  are  several  advantages  for  integrating  Azure 
and  Aneka.  Aneka  can  launch  any  number  of  instances  on 
the  Azure  cloud  to  run  their  applications.  Essentially,  it 
provides  the  provisioning  infrastructure.  Similarly,  Aneka 

 

provides  advanced  PaaS  features  as  shown  in  Figure  5.  It 
provides  multiple  programming  models  (Task,  Thread, 
MapReduce), 
services,  workload 
management  services,  dynamic  provisioning,  QoS  based 
scheduling and flexible billing.

As  discussed  earlier,  trealizese  thubicompmp  vision, 
tools  and  data  needs  to  be  shared  between  application 
developers to create new apps. There are two major hurdles 
in  such  an  implementation.  Firstly,  interaction  between 
clouds becomes critical which is addressed by Aneka in the 
InterCloud  model.  Aneka  support  for  InterCloud  model 
enables 
the  creation  of  a  hybrid  Cloud  computing 
environment  which  combines  the  resources  of  private  and 
public Clouds. That is, whenever private Cloud is unable to 
meet  application  QoS  requirements,  Aneka  leases  extra 
capability  from  public  Cloud  to  ensure  that  application  is 
able  to  execute  within  a  specified  deadline  in  a  seamless 
manner  [47].  Secondly,  data  analytics  and  artificial 

intelligence  tools  are  computationally  demanding  which 
requires  huge  resources.  For  data  analytics  and  artificial 
intelligence  tools,  the  Aneka  task  programming  model 
provides  the  ability  of  expressing  applications  as  a 
collection  of  independent  tasks.  Each  task  can  perform 
different  operations,  or  the  same  operation  on  different 
data,  and  can  be  executed  in  any  order  by  the  runtime 
environment.  In  order  to  demonstrate  this,  we  have  used  a 
scenario  where  there  are  multiple  analytics  algorithm  and 
multiple  data  sources.  A  schematic  of  the  interaction 
between  Aneka  and  Azure  is  given  in  Figure  6  where 
Aneka  Worker  Containers  are  deployed  as  instances  of 
Azure  Worker  Role.  The  Aneka  Master  Container  will  be 
deployed  in  the  on-premises  private  cloud,  while  Aneka 
Worker  Containers  will  be  run  as  instances  of  Microsoft 
Azure  Worker  Role.  As  shown  in  the  Figure  6,  there  are 
two  types  of  Microsoft  Azure  Worker  Roles  used.  These 
are  the  Aneka  Worker  Role  and  Message  Proxy  Role.  In 
this  case,  one  instance  of  the  Message  Proxy  Role  and  at 
least one instance of the Aneka Worker Role are deployed. 
The  maximum  number  of  instances  of  the  Aneka  Worker 
Role  that  can  be  launched  is  limited  by  the  subscription 
offer of Microsoft Azure Service that a user selects. In this 
deployment scenario, when a user submits an application to 
the  Aneka  Master,  the  job  units  will  be  scheduled  by  the 
Aneka  Master  by  leveraging  on-premises  Aneka  Workers, 
if  they  exist,  and  Aneka  Worker  instances  on  Microsoft 
Azure  simultaneously.  When  Aneka  Workers  finish  the 
execution  of  Aneka  work  units,  they  will  send  the  results

back to Aneka Master, and then Aneka Master will send the 
result back to the user application. 

7. Open Challenges and Future Directions 

The  proposed  Cloud  centric  vision  comprises  of  a 
flexible  and  open  architecture  that  is  user  centric  and 
enables different players to interact in the IoT framework. It 
allows  interaction  in  a  manner  suitable  for  their  own 
requirements, rather than the IoT being thrust upon them. In 
this  way,  the  framework  includes  provisions  to  meet 
different requirements for data ownership, security, privacy, 
and sharing of information.  

Some  open  challenges  are  discussed  based  on  the  IoT 
elements  presented  earlier.  The  challenges  include  IoT 
specific  challenges  such  as  privacy,  participatory  sensing, 
data  analytics,  GIS  based  visualization  and  Cloud 
computing  apart  from  the  standard  WSN  challenges 
including 
security, 
protocols,  and  Quality  of  Service.  The  end  goal  is  to  have 
Plug  n‘  Play  smart  objects  which  can  be  deployed  in  any 
environment with an interoperable backbone allowing them 
to  blend  with  other 
them. 
Standardization  of  frequency  bands  and  protocols  plays  a 
pivotal role in accomplishing this goal.

A  roadmap  of  key  developments  in  IoT  research  in  the 
context  of  pervasive  applications  is  shown  in  Figure  8, 
which  includes  the  technology  drivers  and  key  application 
outcomes expected in the next decade [8]. The section ends 
with  a  few  international  initiatives  in  the  domain  which 
could  play  a  vital  role  in  the  success  of  this  rapidly 
emerging technology. 

7.1. Architecture 

the  challenges  particularly 

Overall architecture followed at the initial stages of  IoT 
research  will  have  a  severe  bearing  on  the  field  itself  and 
needs  to  be  investigated.  Most  of  the  work  relating  to  IoT 
architecture  has  been  from  the  wireless  sensor  networks 
perspective [48]. European Union projects of SENSEI [49] 
and Internet of Things-Architecture (IoT-A) [50] have been 
addressing 
from  WSN 
perspective and  have been very successful  for defining the 
architecture  for  different  applications.  We  are  referring 
architecture  to  overall  IoT  where  the  user  is  at  the  center 
and will enable the use of data and infrastructure to develop 
new  applications.  An  architecture  based  on  cloud 
computing  at  the  center  has  been  proposed  in  this  paper. 
However,  this  may  not  be  the  best  option  for  every 
application  domain  particularly  for  defense  where  human 
intelligence  is  relied  upon.  Although  we  see  cloud  centric 
architecture  to  be  the  best  where  cost  based  services  are 
required,  other  architectures  should  be  investigated  for 
different application domains. 

feature 

Another 

required 

important 

for  seamless 
independent IoT working architecture is SaaS to be updated 
by  the  developers  dynamically.  In  this  example,  analytics 
tools (usually in the form of DLLs) have to be updated and 
used  by  several  clients.  Due  to  administrative  privileges 
provided  by  Azure,  this  becomes  a  non-trivial  task. 
Management  Extensibility  Framework  (MEF)  provides  a 
simple solution to the problem. The MEF is a composition 
layer for .NET that improves the flexibility, maintainability 
and  testability  of  large  applications.  MEF  can  be  used  for 
third-party plugin, or it can bring the benefits of a loosely-
coupled  plugin-like  architecture  for  regular  applications.  It 
is a library for creating lightweight, extensible applications. 
It  allows  application  developers  to  discover  and  use 
extensions  with  no  configuration  required.  It  also  lets 
extension  developers  easily  encapsulate  code  and  avoid 
fragile hard dependencies. MEF not only allows extensions 
to be reused  within applications, but across applications as 
well. MEF provides a standard way for the host application 
to  expose 
itself  and  consume  external  extensions. 
Extensions, by their nature, can be reused amongst different 
applications.  However,  an  extension  could  still  be 
implemented  in  a  way  that  is  application-specific.  The 
extensions themselves can depend on one another and MEF 
will make sure they are wired together in the correct order. 
One  of  the  key  design  goals  of  IoT  web  application  is,  it 
would  be  extensible  and  MEF  provides  this  solution.  With 
MEF  we  can  use  different  algorithms  (as  and  when  it 
becomes  available)  for  IoT  data  analytics:  e.g.  drop  an 

Figure 7: System Context Diagram 

analytics  assembly  into  a  folder  and  it  instantly  becomes 
available to the application. The system context diagram of 
the developed data analytics is given in Figure 7.

environment  needs  to  simultaneously  meet  competing 
demands  of  multiple  sensing  modalities.  This  has 
implications  on  network  traffic,  data  storage  and  energy 
utilization.  Importantly,  this  encompasses  both  fixed  and 
mobile sensing infrastructure [51] as well as continuous and 
random sampling. A generalized framework is required for 
data  collection  and  modelling  that  effectively  exploits 
spatial and temporal characteristics of the data, both in the 
sensing  domain  as  well  as  the  associated  transform 
domains.  For  example,  urban  noise  mapping  needs  an 
uninterrupted  collection  of  noise  levels  using  battery 
powered  nodes  using  fixed  infrastructure  and  participatory 
sensing  [51]  as  a  key  component  for  health  and  quality  of 
life services for its inhabitants.

finding 
coefficient vector that agrees with the measurements. In the 
ubiquitous  sensing  context,  this  has  implications  for  data 
compression, network traffic and the distribution of sensors. 
Compressive  wireless  sensing  (CWS)  utilizes  synchronous 
communication  to  reduce  the  transmission  power  of  each 
sensor  [53];  transmitting  noisy  projections  of  data  samples 
to a central location for aggregation. 

7.3. Secure reprogrammable networks and Privacy 

Security will be a major concern wherever networks are 
deployed at large scale. There can be many ways the system 
could  be  attacked  -  disabling  the  network  availability; 
pushing erroneous data into the network; accessing personal 
information;  etc.  The  three  physical  components  of  IoT  - 
RFID,  WSN  and  cloud  are  vulnerable  to  such  attacks. 
Security is critical to any network [54,55] and the first line 
of defence against data corruption is cryptography. 

Of the three, RFID (particularly passive) seems to be the 
most  vulnerable as it allows  person tracking as  well as  the 

 

objects  and  no  high  level  intelligence  can  be  enabled  on 
these devices [15]. These complex problems however have 
solutions  which  can  be  provided  using  cryptographic 
methods and deserves more research before they are widely 
accepted. 

nodes 

Against  outsider  attackers,  encryption  ensures  data 
confidentiality,  whereas  message  authentication  codes 
ensure  data  integrity  and  authenticity  [56].  Encryption, 
however, does not protect against insider malicious attacks, 
to  address  which  non-cryptographic  means  are  needed, 
particularly  in  WSNs.  Also,  periodically,  new  sensor 
applications need to be installed, or existing ones need to be 
updated. This is done by remote wireless reprogramming of 
all 
network 
reprogramming  consists  solely  of  a  data  dissemination 
protocol that distributes code to all the nodes in the network 
without authentication, which is a security threat. A secure 
reprogramming  protocol  allows  the  nodes  to  authenticate 
every code update and prevent malicious installation. Most 
such  protocols  (e.g.,  [57])  are  based  on  the  benchmark 
protocol  Deluge  [58].  We  need  cryptographic  add-ons  to 
Deluge  which  lays  foundation  for  more  sophisticated 
algorithms to be developed. 

network.  Traditional 

in 

the 

Security  in  the  cloud  is  another  important  area  of 
research  which  will  need  more  attention.  Along  with  the 
presence  of  the  data  and  tools,  cloud  also  handles 
economics  of  IoT  which  will  make  it  a  bigger  threat  from 
attackers.  Security  and  identity  protection  becomes  critical 
in  hybrid  clouds  where  a  private  as  well  as  public  clouds 
will be used by businesses [59]. 

Remembering forever in the context of IoT raises many 
privacy issues as the data collected can be used in positive 
(for  advertisement  services)  and  negative  ways  (for 
defamation).  Digital  forgetting  could  emerge  as  one  of  the 
key  areas  of  research  to  address  the  concerns  and  the 
development  of  appropriate  framework  to  protect  personal 
data [44]. 

segments  often  constitute  ‗gaps‘  in  resource  guarantee  due 
to resource allocation and management ability constraints in 
shared  wireless  media.  Quality  of  Service 
in  cloud 
Computing  is  another  major  research  area  which  will 
require  more  and  more  attention  as  the  data  and  tools 
become  available  on  clouds.  Dynamic  scheduling  and 
resource  allocation  algorithms  based  on  particle  swarm 
optimization  are  being  developed.  For  high  capacity 
applications  and  as  IoT  grows,  this  could  become  a 
bottleneck. 

7.5. New protocols 

The  protocols  at  the  sensing  end  of  IoT  will  play  a  key 
role  in  complete  realisation.  They  form  the  backbone  for 
the data tunnel between sensors and the outer world. For the 
system  to  work  efficiently,  and  energy  efficient  MAC 
protocol  and  appropriate  routing  protocol  are  critical. 
Several  MAC  protocols  have  been  proposed  for  various 
domains  with  TDMA  (collision  free),  CSMA  (low  traffic 
efficiency)  and  FDMA 
requires 
additional circuitry in nodes) schemes available to the user 
[67].  None  of  them  are  accepted  as  a  standard  and  with 
more  ‗things‘  available  this  scenario  is  going  to  get  more 
cluttered which requires further research. 

(collision 

free  but 

An  individual  sensor  can  drop  out  for  a  number  of 
reasons, so the network must be self-adapting and allow for 
multi-path routing. Multi-hop routing protocols are used in 
mobile  ad  hoc  networks  and  terrestrial  WSNs  [68].  They 
are  mainly  divided  into  three  categories  -  data  centric, 
location  based  and  hierarchical,  again  based  on  different 
application  domains.  Energy  is  the  main  consideration  for 
the existing routing protocols. In the case of  IoT, it should 
be noted that a backbone  will be available and the number 
of hops in the multi-hop scenario will be limited. In such a 
scenario,  the  existing  routing  protocols  should  suffice  in 
practical implementation with minor modifications. 

7.4. Quality of Service 

7.6. Participatory Sensing 

Heterogeneous  networks  are  (by  default)  multi-service; 
providing  more  than  one  distinct  application  or  service. 
This  implies  not  only  multiple  traffic  types  within  the 
network, but also the ability of a single network to support 
all  applications  without  QoS  compromise  [60].  There  are 
two  application  classes:  throughput  and  delay  tolerant 
elastic traffic of (e.g. monitoring weather parameters at low 
sampling  rates),  and  the  bandwidth  and  delay  sensitive 
inelastic (real-time) traffic (e.g. noise or traffic monitoring), 
which  can  be  further  discriminated  by  data-related 
applications  (e.g.  high-vs.-low  resolution  videos)  with 
different  QoS  requirements.  Therefore,  a  controlled, 
optimal  approach  to  serve  different  network  traffics,  each 
with  its  own  application  QoS  needs  is  required  [61].  It  is 
not easy to provide QoS guarantees in wireless networks, as 

A  number  of  projects  have  begun  to  address  the 
development  of  people  centric  (or  participatory)  sensing 
platforms  [51,62-64].  As  noted  earlier,  people  centric 
sensing  offers  the  possibility  of  low  cost  sensing  of  the 
environment localized to the user. It can therefore give the 
closest indication of environmental parameters experienced 
by  the  user.  It  has  been  noted  that  environmental  data 
collected by  user forms a social currency [65]. This results 
in  more  timely  data  being  generated  compared  to  the  data 
available  through  a  fixed  infrastructure  sensor  network. 
Most  importantly,  it  is  the  opportunity  for  the  user  to 
provide 
their  experience  of  a  given 
environmental parameter that offers valuable information in 
the form of context associated with a given event. 

feedback  on

The  limitations  of  people  centric  sensing  place  new 
significance  on  the reference  data role provided by a  fixed 
infrastructure  IoT  as  a  backbone.  The  problem  of  missing 
samples  is  a  fundamental  limitation  of  people  centric 
sensing.  Relying  on  users  volunteering  data  and  on  the 
inconsistent  gathering  of  samples  obtained  across  varying 
times  and  varying  locations  (based  on  a  user's  desired 
participation  and  given  location  or  travel  path),  limits  the 
ability to produce meaningful data for any applications and 
policy decisions. Only in addressing issues and implications 
of  data  ownership,  privacy  and  appropriate  participation 
incentives,  can  such  a  platform  achieve  genuine  end-user 
engagement.  Further  sensing  modalities  can  be  obtained 
through  the  addition  of  sensor  modules  attached  to  the 
phone  for  application  specific  sensing,  such  as  air  quality 
sensors  [66]  or  biometric  sensors.  In  such  scenarios,  smart 
phones  become  critical  IoT  nodes  which  are  connected  to 
the cloud on one end and several sensors at the other end. 

7.7. Data mining 

Extracting  useful  information  from  a  complex  sensing 
environment at different spatial and temporal resolutions is 
a  challenging  research  problem  in  artificial  intelligence. 
Current  state-of-the-art  methods  use  shallow  learning 
methods  where  pre-defined  events  and  data  anomalies  are 
extracted  using  supervised  and  unsupervised  learning  [69]. 
The next level of learning involves inferring local activities 
by  using  temporal  information  of  events  extracted  from 
shallow  learning.  The  ultimate  vision  will  be  to  detect 
complex events based on larger spatial and longer temporal 
scales  based  on  the  two  levels  before.  The  fundamental 
research  problem 
sensing 
environments of this nature is how to simultaneously learn 
representations of events and activities at multiple levels of 
complexity  (i.e.,  events,  local  activities  and  complex 
activities). An emerging focus in machine learning research 
has been the field of deep learning [70], which aims to learn 
multiple  layers  of  abstraction  that  can  be  used  to  interpret 
given  data.  Furthermore,  the  resource  constraints  in  sensor 
networks create novel challenges for deep learning in terms 
of  the  need  for  adaptive,  distributed  and  incremental 
learning techniques.

technologies 

As  new  display 

creative 
visualization  will  be  enabled.  The  evolution  from  CRT  to 
Plasma,  LCD,  LED,  and  AMOLED  displays  have  given 
rise  to  highly  efficient  data  representation  (using  touch 
interface)  with  the  user  being  able  to  navigate  the  data 
better  than  ever  before.  With  emerging  3D  displays,  this 
area  is  certain  to  have  more  research  and  development 
opportunities.  However,  the  data  which  comes  out  of 
ubiquitous  computing  is  not  always  ready  for  direct

consumption  using  visualization  platforms  and  requires 
further processing. The scenario becomes very complex for 
heterogeneous spatio-temporal data [71]. New visualization 
schemes  for representation of heterogeneous sensors in 3D 
landscape that varies temporally have to be developed [72]. 
Another  challenge  of  visualizing  data  collected  within  IoT 
is that they are geo-related and are sparsely distributed. To 
cope with such a challenge, a framework based on Internet 
GIS is required. 

7.9. Cloud Computing 

An  integrated  IoT  and  Cloud  computing  applications  
enabling the creation of smart environments such as Smart 
Cities  need  to  be  able  to  (a)  combine  services  offered  by 
multiple  stakeholders  and  (b)  scale  to  support  a  large 
number  of  users  in  a  reliable  and  decentralized  manner. 
They  need  to  be  able  operate  in  both  wired  and  wireless 
network  environments  and  deal  with  constraints  such  as 
access  devices  or  data  sources  with  limited  power  and 
unreliable  connectivity.  The  Cloud  application  platforms 
need  to  be  enhanced  to  support  (a)  the  rapid  creation  of 
applications  by  providing  domain  specific  programming 
tools  and  environments  and  (b)  seamless  execution  of 
applications  harnessing  capabilities  of  multiple  dynamic 
and  heterogeneous  resources  to  meet  quality  of  service 
requirements of diverse users.  

The Cloud resource management and scheduling system 
should  be  able  to  dynamically  prioritize    requests  and 
provision resources such that critical requests are served in 
real  time.  To  deliver  results  in  a  reliable  manner,  the 
scheduler  needs  to  be  augmented  with  task  duplication 
algorithms  for failure  management. Specifically, the  Cloud 
application  scheduling  algorithms  need  to  exhibit  the 
following capability: 
1.  Multi-objective optimization: The scheduling algorithms 
should  be  able  to  deal  with  QoS  parameters  such  as 
response  time,  cost  of  service  usage,  maximum  number 
of  resources  available  per  unit  price,  and  penalties  for 
service degradation.  

2.  Task  duplication  based  fault  tolerance:  Critical  tasks  of 
an  application  will  be  transparently  replicated  and 
executed  on  different  resources  so  that  if  one  resource 
fails  to  complete  the  task,  the  replicated  version  can  be 
used. This logic is crucial in real-time tasks that need to 
be processed to deliver services in a timely manner.   

7.10. International Activities 

Internet  of  Things  activities  is  gathering  momentum 
around  the  world,  with  numerous  initiatives  underway 
across 
levels  of 
government,  as  key  stakeholders  seek  to  map  a  way 
forward for the coordinated realization of this technological 
evolution.  In  Europe,  substantial  effort  is  underway  to 

industry,  academia  and  various 

 

consolidate  the  cross-domain  activities  of  research  groups 
and  organizations,  spanning  M2M,  WSN  and  RFID  into  a 
unified  IoT  framework.  Supported  by 
the  European 
Commission 7thFramework program (EU-FP7) this includes 
the  Internet  of  Things  European  Research  Cluster  (IERC). 
Encompassing a number of EU FP7 projects, its objectives 
are: to establish a cooperation platform and research vision 
for IoT activities in Europe and become a contact point for 
IoT  research  in  the  world.  It  includes  projects  such  as 
CASAGRAS2, a consortium  of international partners  from 
Europe, the USA, China, Japan and Korea exploring issues 
surrounding  RFID  and  its  role  in  realizing  the  Internet  of 
Things.  As  well,  IERC  includes  the  Internet  of  Things 
Architecture  (IoT-A)  project  established  to  determine  an 
architectural  reference  model  for  the  interoperability  of 
Internet-of-Things  systems  and  key  building  blocks  to 
achieve this. At the same time, the IoT Initiative (IoT-i) is a 
coordinated  action  established  to  support  the  development 
of  the  European  IoT  community.  The  IoT-i  project  brings 
together a consortium of partners to create a joint strategic 
and technical vision for the IoT in Europe that encompasses 
the  currently  fragmented  sectors  of  the  IoT  domain 
holistically.  Simultaneously,  the  SmartSantander  project  is 
developing a city scale IoT testbed for research and service 
provision  deployed  across  the  city  of  Santander,  Spain,  as 
well  as  sites  located  in  the  UK,  Germany,  Serbia  and 
Australia. 

At the same time large scale initiatives are underway in 
Japan,  Korea,  the  USA  and  Australia,  where  industry, 
associated  organizations  and  government  departments  are 
collaborating  on  various  programs,  advancing  related 
capabilities  towards  an  IoT.  This  includes  smart  city 
initiatives,  smart  grid  programs 
incorporating  smart 
metering technologies and roll-out of high speed broadband 
infrastructure.  A  continuing  development  of  RFID  related 
technologies by industry and consortiums such as the Auto-
ID  lab  (founded  at  MIT  and  now  with  satellite  labs  at 
leading  universities  in  South  Korea,  China,  Japan,  United 
Kingdom,  Australia and Switzerland) dedicated to creating 
the  Internet  of  Things  using  RFID  and  Wireless  Sensor 
Networks  are  being  pursued.  Significantly,  the  need  for 
consensus  around  IoT  technical  issues  has  seen  the 
establishment  of  the  Internet  Protocol  for  Smart  Objects 
(IPSO)  Alliance,  now  with  more 
than  60  member 
companies  from  leading  technology,  communications  and 
energy  companies,  working  with  standards  bodies,  such  as 
IETF, IEEE and ITU to specify new IP-based technologies 
and  promote  industry  consensus  for  assembling  the  parts 
for  the  Internet  of  Things.  Substantial  IoT  development 
activity is also underway in China, with its 12th Five Year 
Plan 
investment  and 
development  to  be  focused  on:  smart  grid;  intelligent 
transportation;  smart  logistics;  smart  home;  environment 
and safety testing; industrial control and automation; health 
care; fine agriculture; finance and service; military defense.

This  is  being  aided  by  the  establishment  of  an  Internet  of 
Things  center  in  Shanghai  (with  a  total  investment  over 
US$  100million)  to  study  technologies  and  industrial 
standards.  An  industry  fund  for  Internet  of  Things,  and  an 
Internet of Things Union ‗Sensing China‘ has been founded 
in  Wuxi,  initiated  by  more  than  60  telecom  operators, 
institutes and companies who are the primary drivers of the 
industry. 

8. Summary and Conclusions 

The  proliferation  of  devices  with  communicating-
actuating  capabilities  is  bringing  closer  the  vision  of  an 
Internet  of  Things,  where  the  sensing  and  actuation 
functions  seamlessly  blend  into  the  background  and  new 
capabilities  are  made  possible  through  access  of  rich  new 
information  sources.  The  evolution  of  the  next  generation 
mobile system  will depend on the creativity of  the users in 
designing  new  applications.  IoT  is  an  ideal  emerging 
technology  to  influence  this  domain  by  providing  new 
evolving data and the required computational resources  for 
creating revolutionary apps.  

Presented  here  is  a  user-centric  cloud  based  model  for 
approaching this goal through the interaction of private and 
public clouds. In this manner, the needs of the end-user are 
brought to the fore. Allowing for the necessary flexibility to 
meet  the  diverse  and  sometimes  competing  needs  of 
different  sectors,  we  propose  a  framework  enabled  by  a 
scalable cloud to provide the capacity to utilize the IoT. The 
framework  allows  networking,  computation,  storage  and 
visualization themes separate thereby allowing independent 
growth  in  every  sector  but  complementing  each  other  in  a 
shared  environment.  The 
is 
underway  in  each  of  these  themes  will  not  be  adversely 
affected  with  Cloud  at  its  center.  In  proposing  the  new 
framework  associated  challenges  have  been  highlighted 
ranging from appropriate interpretation and visualization of 
the  vast  amounts  of  data,  through  to  the  privacy,  security 
and  data  management  issues  that  must  underpin  such  a 
platform  in  order  for  it  to  be  genuinely  viable.  The 
consolidation  of  international  initiatives  is  quite  clearly 
towards  an  IoT,  providing  an 
accelerating  progress 
overarching  view  for 
integration  and  functional 
elements that can deliver an operational IoT.

Abstract 

Ubiquitous sensing enabled by  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across  many areas of  modern day living. This 
offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban 
environments.  The  proliferation  of  these  devices  in  a  communicating-actuating  network  creates  the  Internet  of  Things  (IoT), 
wherein, sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in 
order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fuelled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling device technologies 
such  as  RFID  tags  and  readers,  near  field  communication  (NFC)  devices  and  embedded  sensor  and  actuator  nodes,  the  IoT  has 
stepped  out  of  its  infancy  and  is  the  the  next  revolutionary  technology  in  transforming  the  Internet  into  a  fully  integrated  Future 
Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need 
for  data-on-demand  using  sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases  significantly.  This  paper  presents  a  cloud  centric  vision  for 
worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT 
research in the near future are discussed. A cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public 
clouds is presented. We conclude our  IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of  WSN, the Internet and  distributed 
computing directed at technological research community.

Frequency  IDentification  (RFID)  and  sensor  network 
technologies will rise to meet this new challenge, in which 
information  and  communication  systems  are  invisibly 
embedded in the environment around us. This results in the 
generation  of  enormous  amounts  of  data  which  have  to  be 
stored, processed and presented in a seamless, efficient and

Smart  connectivity  with  existing  networks  and  context-
aware  computation  using  network 
is  an 
indispensable  part  of  IoT.  With  the  growing  presence  of 
WiFi  and  4G-LTE  wireless  Internet  access,  the  evolution 
toward  ubiquitous 
communication 
networks  is  already  evident.  However,  for  the  Internet  of 
Things  vision  to  successfully  emerge,  the  computing 
criterion  will  need  to  go  beyond  traditional  mobile 
computing  scenarios  that  use  smart  phones  and  portables, 
and  evolve  into  connecting  everyday  existing  objects  and 
embedding 
into  our  environment.  For 
technology to disappear from the consciousness of the user, 
the Internet of Things demands: (1) a shared understanding 
of  the  situation  of  its  users  and  their  appliances,  (2)

A  radical  evolution  of  the  current  Internet  into  a 
Network  of  interconnected  objects  that  not  only  harvests 
information  from  the  environment  (sensing)  and  interacts 
with  the  physical  world  (actuation/command/control),  but 
also uses existing Internet standards to provide services for 
information 
and 
communications.  Fuelled  by  the  prevalence  of  devices 
enabled  by  open  wireless  technology  such  as  Bluetooth, 
radio frequency identification (RFID), Wi-Fi and telephonic 
data  services  as  well  as  embedded  sensor  and  actuator 
nodes, IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is on the verge 
of  transforming  the  current  static  Internet  into  a  fully 
integrated Future Internet [1]. Internet revolution led to the 
interconnection  between  people  at  an  unprecedented  scale 
and  pace.  The  next  revolution  will  be  the  interconnection 
between  objects  to  create  a  smart  environment.  Only  in

2011,  the  number  of  interconnected  devices  on  the  planet 
overtook the actual number of people. Currently there are 9 
billion interconnected devices and it is expected to reach 24 
billion  devices  by  2020.  According  to  the  GSMA,  this 
amounts  to  $1.3  trillion  revenue  opportunities  for  mobile 
network operators alone spanning vertical segments such as 
health,  automotive,  utilities  and  consumer  electronics.  A 
schematic  of  the  interconnection  of  objects  is  depicted  in 
Figure  1  where  the  application  domains  are  chosen  based 
on the  scale of the impact of  the data generated. The users

addressing wide ranging issues. 

This  paper  presents  the  current  trends  in  IoT  research 
propelled  by  applications  and  the  need  for  convergence  in 
several 
interdisciplinary  technologies.  Specifically,  we

2. Ubiquitous computing in the next decade 

The  effort  by  researchers  to  create  human-to-human 
interface  through  technology  in  the  late  1980s  resulted  in 
the  creation  of  the  ubiquitous  computing  discipline,  whose 
objective  is  to  embed  technology  into  the  background  of 
everyday  life.  Currently,  we  are  in  the  post-PC  era  where 
smart phones and other  handheld devices are changing our 
environment  by  making  it  more  interactive  as  well  as 
informative.  Mark  Weiser,  the  forefather  of  Ubiquitous 
Computing  (ubicomp),  defined  a  smart  environment  [2]  as 
―the  physical  world  that  is  richly  and  invisibly  interwoven 
with  sensors,  actuators,  displays,  and  computational 
elements,  embedded  seamlessly  in  the  everyday  objects  of 
our lives, and connected through a continuous network.‖ 

The  creation  of  the  Internet  has  marked  a  foremost 
milestone 
towards  achieving  ubicomp‘s  vision  which 
enables  individual  devices  to  communicate  with  any  other 
device  in  the  world.  The  inter-networking  reveals  the 
potential  of  a  seemingly  endless  amount  of  distributed 
computing resources and storage owned by various owners.

In  contrast  to  Weiser‘s  calm  computing  approach, 
Rogers  proposes  a  human  centric  ubicomp  which  makes 
use  of  human  creativity  in  exploiting  the  environment  and 
extending  their  capabilities  [3].  He  proposes  a  domain 
specific ubicomp solution when he says –―In terms of who 
should  benefit,  it  is  useful  to  think  of  how  ubicomp 
technologies  can  be  developed  not  for  the  Sal‘s  of  the 
world,  but  for  particular  domains  that  can  be  set  up  and 
customized  by  an  individual  firm  or  organization,  such  as 
for  agriculture  production,  environmental  restoration  or 
retailing.‖

the  progress, 
opportunities and challenges during the 20 year anniversary 
of  ubicomp.  They  discuss  the  building  blocks  of  ubicomp 
and  the  characteristics  of  the  system  to  adapt  to  the 
changing  world.  More  importantly,  they  identify  two 
critical technologies for growing the ubicomp infrastructure 
- Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. 

systems 

(MEMS) 

The  advancements  and  convergence  of  micro-electro-
mechanical 
technology,  wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics  has  resulted  in  the 
development  of  miniature  devices  having  the  ability  to 
sense,  compute  and  communicate  wirelessly  in  short 
distances.  These  miniature 
nodes 
interconnect to form a wireless sensor networks (WSN) and 
find  wide  application 
in  environmental  monitoring, 
infrastructure monitoring, traffic monitoring, retail, etc. [5].

This has the ability to provide ubiquitous sensing capability 
which  is  critical  in  realizing  the  overall  vision  of  ubicomp 
as outlined by Weiser [2]. 

For the realization of a complete IoT vision, an efficient, 
secure, scalable and market oriented computing and storage 
resourcing  is  essential.  Cloud  computing  [6]  is  the  most 
recent paradigm to emerge which promises reliable services 
delivered  through  next  generation  data  centres  that  are 
based  on  virtualised  storage  technologies.  This  platform 
acts as a receiver of data from the  ubiquitous sensors; as  a 
computer  to  analyze  and  interpret  the  data;  as  well  as 
providing  the  user  with  easy  to  understand  web  based 
visualization. The ubiquitous sensing and processing works 
in the background, hidden from the user. 

This 

novel 

integrated 

Sensor-Actuator-Internet 
framework  shall  form  the  core  technology  around  which  a 
smart  environment  will  be  shaped:  information  generated 
will be shared across diverse platforms and applications, to 
develop  a  common  operating  picture  (COP)  of  an 
environment, where control of certain unrestricted ‗Things‘ 
is  made  possible.  As  we  move  from  www  (static  pages 
web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous 
computing  web),  the  need  for  data-on-demand  using 
sophisticated  intuitive  queries  increases.  To  take  full 
advantage  of  the  available  Internet  technology,  there  is  a 
need  to  deploy  large-scale,  platform-independent,  wireless 
sensor 
data 
management and processing, actuation and analytics. Cloud 
computing  promises  high 
reliability,  scalability  and 
autonomy  to  provide  ubiquitous  access,  dynamic  resource 
discovery  and  composability 
the  next 
generation Internet of Things applications. Consumers  will 
be able to choose the service level by changing the Quality 
of Service parameters.

three  paradigms  – 

As identified by Atzori et. al. [7], Internet of Things can 
be 
internet-oriented 
(middleware),  things  oriented  (sensors)  and  semantic-
oriented  (knowledge).  Although  this  type  of  delineation  is 
required  due  to  the  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  subject, 
the  usefulness  of  IoT  can  be  unleashed  only  in  an 
application domain where the three paradigms intersect.  
 
The RFID group defines Internet of Things as – 
  The  worldwide  network  of 

interconnected  objects 
uniquely  addressable  based  on  standard  communication 
protocols. 

 
According  to  Cluster  of  European  research  projects  on  the 
Internet of Things [8] –

  ‗Things‘ are active participants in business, information 
and  social  processes  where  they  are  enabled  to  interact 
and  communicate  among  themselves  and  with  the 
environment by exchanging data and information sensed 
about  the  environment,  while  reacting  autonomously  to 
the  real/physical  world  events  and  influencing  it  by 
running processes that trigger actions and create services 
with or without direct human intervention. 

 
According to Forrester [9], a smart environment – 
  Uses  information  and  communications  technologies  to 
make the critical infrastructure components and services 
of  a  city  administration,  education,  healthcare,  public 
safety,  real  estate,  transportation  and  utilities  more 
aware, interactive and efficient.  
 
In  our  definition,  we  make  the  definition  more  user 
centric and do not restrict it to any standard communication 
protocol.  This  will  allow  long-lasting  applications  to  be 
developed and deployed using the available state-of-the-art 
protocols  at  any  given  point  in  time.  Our  definition  of 
Internet of Things for smart environments is – 
  Interconnection  of  sensing  and  actuating  devices 
providing 
information  across 
platforms  through  a  unified  framework,  developing  a 
common  operating  picture  for  enabling  innovative 
applications.  This  is  achieved  by  seamless  large  scale 
sensing,  data  analytics  and  information  representation 
using  cutting  edge  ubiquitous  sensing  and  cloud 
computing.

3.2. Trends 

Internet  of  Things  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the 
emerging technologies in IT as noted in Gartner‘s IT Hype 
Cycle  (see  Figure  2).  A  Hype  Cycle  [10]  is  a  way  to 
represent the emergence, adoption,  maturity and impact on 
applications of specific technologies. It has been forecasted 
that IoT will take 5-10 years for market adoption. 

The  popularity  of  different  paradigms  varies  with  time. 
The  web  search  popularity,  as  measured  by  the  Google 
search trends during the last 10 years for the terms Internet 
of  Things,  Wireless  Sensor  Networks  and  Ubiquitous 
Computing  are  shown  in  Figure  3  [11].  As  it  can  be  seen, 
since  IoT  has  come  into  existence,  search  volume  is 
consistently  increasing  with  the  falling  trend  for  Wireless 
Sensor  Networks.  This  trend  is  likely  to  continue  for  the 
next  decade  as  other  enabling  technologies  converge  to 
form  a  genuine  Internet  of  Things.  From  the  News 
Reference  Volume  data  (see  Figure  3  bottom)the  Internet 
be  observed  that  Internet  of  Things  has  started  gaining 
popularity.  In  fact,  this  reflects  the  social  acceptability  of 
the  technology  as  consumers  look  for  more  data  about 
various  topics  of  interest.  Spot  points  in  Figure  3  indicate

3.3. IoT Elements 

We  present  a  taxonomy  that  will  aid  in  defining  the 
components  required  for  Internet  of  Things  from  a  high 
level  perspective.  Specific  taxonomies  of  each  component 
can  be  found  elsewhere  [6,12,13].  There  are  three  IoT 
components which enables seamless ubicomp: a) Hardware 
-  made  up  of 
sensors,  actuators  and  embedded 
communication  hardware  b)  Middleware  -  on  demand 
storage  and  computing  tools  for  data  analytics  and  c) 
Presentation  -  novel  easy  to  understand  visualization  and 
interpretation  tools  which  can  be  widely  accessed  on 
different platforms and which can be designed for different 
applications.  In  this  section,  we  discuss  a  few  enabling 
technologies  in  these  categories  which  will  make  up  the 
three components stated above. 

3.3.1. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 

RFID  technology  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  the 
embedded  communication  paradigm  which  enables  design 
of  microchips  for  wireless  data  communication.  They  help 
in automatic identification of  anything they are attached to 
acting  as  an  electronic  barcode  [14,15]. The  passive  RFID 
tags are not battery powered and they use the power  of the 
reader‘s  interrogation  signal  to  communicate  the  ID  to  the 
RFID  reader.  This  has  resulted  in  many  applications 

 

5 

particularly  in  retail  and  supply  chain  management.  The 
applications can be found in transportation (replacement of 
tickets, registration stickers) and access control applications 
as well. The passive tags are currently being used in many 
bank  cards  and  road  toll  tags  which  is  among  the  first 
global  deployments.  Active  RFID  readers  have  their  own 
battery  supply  and  can  instantiate  the  communication.  Of 
the  several  applications,  the  main  application  of  active 
RFID tags is in port containers [15] for monitoring cargo. 

3.3.2. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) 

the 

analysis 

collection,  processing, 

Recent  technological  advances  in  low  power  integrated 
circuits  and  wireless  communications  have  made  available 
efficient, low cost, low power  miniature devices for  use in 
remote  sensing  applications.  The  combination  of  these 
factors  has  improved  the  viability  of  utilizing  a  sensor 
network consisting of a large number of intelligent sensors, 
enabling 
and 
dissemination of valuable information, gathered in a variety 
of environments [5]. Active RFID is nearly the same as the 
lower  end  WSN  nodes  with  limited  processing  capability 
and  storage.  The  scientific  challenges 
that  must  be 
overcome  in  order  to  realize  the  enormous  potential  of 
WSNs  are  substantial  and  multidisciplinary  in  nature  [5]. 
Sensor  data  are  shared  among  sensor  nodes  and  sent  to  a 
distributed  or  centralized  system  for  analytics.  The 
components  that  make  up  the  WSN  monitoring  network 
include:   
 

 

a)  WSN hardware - Typically a node (WSN core hardware) 
contains sensor interfaces, processing units, transceiver 
units and power supply. Almost always, they comprise 
of  multiple  A/D  converters  for  sensor  interfacing  and 
more  modern  sensor  nodes  have 
to 
communicate  using  one  frequency  band  making  them 
more versatile [5].  

the  ability 

b)  WSN communication stack  - The nodes are expected to 
be deployed in an adhoc manner for most applications. 
Designing  an  appropriate  topology,  routing  and  MAC 
layer  is  critical  for  scalability  and  longevity  of  the 
deployed  network.  Nodes 
to 
communicate  among  themselves  to  transmit  data  in 
single  or  multi-hop  to  a  base  station.  Node  drop  outs, 
and  consequent  degraded  network 
lifetimes,  are 
frequent.  The  communication  stack  at  the  sink  node 
should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  outside  world 
through  the  Internet  to  act  as  a  gateway  to  the  WSN 
subnet and the Internet [16].  

in  a  WSN  need 

c)  Middleware 

resources 

-  A  mechanism 

to  combine  cyber 
infrastructure  with  a  Service  Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  and  sensor  networks  to  provide  access  to 
heterogeneous  sensor  resources 
in  a  deployment 
independent  manner  [17]. This  is  based  on  the  idea  to 
isolate 
that  can  be  used  by  several 
applications.  A  platform  independent  middleware  for 
developing  sensor  applications  is  required,  such  as  an 
Open Sensor Web  Architecture (OSWA) [18]. OSWA 
is  built  upon  a  uniform  set  of  operations  and  standard 
data  representations  as  defined  in  the  Sensor  Web 
Enablement  Method  (SWE)  by  the  Open  Geospatial 
Consortium (OGC).  

d)  Secure  Data  aggregation  -  An  efficient  and  secure  data 
aggregation  method  is  required  for  extending  the 
lifetime of the network as well as ensuring reliable data 
collected  from  sensors  [19].  Node  failure  being  a 
common characteristic of WSNs, the network topology 
should  have  the  capability  to  heal  itself.  Ensuring 
security is critical as the system is automatically linked 
to  actuators  and  protecting  the  systems  from  intruders 
becomes very important. 

3.3.3. Addressing schemes 

The  ability  to  uniquely  identify  ‗Things‘  is  critical  for 
the success of IoT. This will not only allow us to uniquely 
identify  billions  of  devices  but  also  to  control  remote 
devices through the Internet. The few most critical features 
of  creating  a  unique  address  are:  uniqueness,  reliability, 
persistence and scalability. 

Every  element  that  is  already  connected  and  those  that 
are  going  to  be  connected,  must  be  identified  by  their 
unique  identification,  location  and  functionalities.  The 
current  IPv4  may  support  to  an  extent  where  a  group  of 
cohabiting sensor devices can be identified geographically, 
but not individually. The Internet Mobility  attributes in the 

 

6 

IPV6  may  alleviate  some  of  the  device  identification 
problems;  however,  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  wireless 
nodes,  variable  data  types,  concurrent  operations  and 
confluence  of  data  from  devices  exacerbates  the  problem 
further [20]. 

Persistent network functioning to channel the data traffic 
ubiquitously  and  relentlessly  is  another  aspect  of  IoT. 
Although,  the  TCP/IP  takes  care  of  this  mechanism  by 
routing in a more reliable and efficient way, from source to 
destination,  the  IoT  faces  a  bottleneck  at  the  interface 
between 
the  gateway  and  wireless  sensor  devices. 
Furthermore,  the  scalability  of  the  device  address  of  the 
existing  network  must  be  sustainable.  The  addition  of 
networks and devices  must not hamper the performance of 
the network, the functioning of the devices, the reliability of 
the data over the network or the effective use of the devices 
from the user interface. 

system 

for 

fundamental 

is  considered 

To  address  these  issues,  the  Uniform  Resource  Name 
(URN) 
the 
development of IoT. URN creates replicas of the resources 
that can be accessed through the URL. With large amounts 
of spatial data being gathered, it is often quite important to 
take  advantage  of  the  benefits  of  metadata  for  transferring 
the information from a database to the user via the Internet 
[21].  IPv6  also  gives  a  very  good  option  to  access  the 
resources  uniquely  and 
remotely.  Another  critical 
development  in  addressing  is  the  development  of  a  light 
weight  IPv6  that  will  enable  addressing  home  appliances 
uniquely. 

Wireless sensor networks (considering them as building 
blocks of IoT), which run on a different stack compared to 
the  Internet,  cannot  possess  IPv6  stack 
to  address 
individually  and  hence  a  subnet  with  a  gateway  having  a 
URN  will  be  required.  With  this  in  mind,  we  then  need  a 
layer for addressing sensor devices by the relevant gateway. 
At  the  subnet  level,  the  URN  for  the  sensor  devices  could 
be  the  unique  IDs  rather  than  human-friendly  names  as  in 
the www, and a lookup table at the gateway to address this 
device.  Further,  at  the  node  level  each  sensor  will  have  a 
URN  (as  numbers)  for  sensors  to  be  addressed  by  the 
gateway.  The  entire  network  now  forms  a  web  of 
connectivity  from  users  (high-level)  to  sensors  (low-level) 
that  is  addressable  (through  URN),  accessible  (through 
URL) and controllable (through URC). 

3.3.4. Data storage and analytics 

One  of  the  most  important  outcomes  of  this  emerging 
field  is  the  creation  of  an  unprecedented  amount  of  data. 
Storage,  ownership  and  expiry  of  the  data  become  critical 
issues. The internet consumes up to 5% of the total energy 
generated today and with these types of demands, it is sure 
to  go  up  even  further.  Hence  data  centers  which  run  on 
harvested  energy  and  which  are  centralized  will  ensure 
energy efficiency as well as reliability. The data have to be 
stored  and  used  intelligently  for  smart  monitoring  and 

 

algorithms,  genetic 

actuation.  It  is  important  to  develop  artificial  intelligence 
algorithms  which  could  be  centralized  or  distributed  based 
on the need. Novel fusion algorithms need to be developed 
to  make  sense  of  the  data  collected.  State-of-the-art  non-
linear,  temporal  machine  learning  methods  based  on 
evolutionary 
algorithms,  neural 
networks,  and  other  artificial  intelligence  techniques  are 
necessary  to  achieve  automated  decision  making.  These 
systems  show  characteristics  such  as 
interoperability, 
integration and adaptive communications. They also have a 
modular  architecture  both  in  terms  of  hardware  system 
design  as  well  as  software  development  and  are  usually 
very well-suited for IoT applications. 

 

3.3.5. Visualization 

Visualization  is  critical  for  an  IoT  application  as  this 
allows  interaction  of  the  user  with  the  environment.  With 
recent  advances  in  touch  screen  technologies,  use  of  smart 
tablets  and  phones  has  become  very  intuitive.  For  a  lay 
person  to  fully  benefit  from  the  IoT  revolution,  attractive 
and easy to understand visualization have to be created. As 
we move from 2D to 3D screens, more information can be 
provided  to  the  user  in  meaningful  ways  for  consumers. 
This  will  also  enable  policy  makers  to  convert  data  into 
knowledge  which  is  critical  in  fast  decision  making. 
Extraction of meaningful information from raw data is non-
trivial.  This  encompasses  both  event  detection  and 
visualization of the associated raw and modelled data, with 
information represented according  to the needs of  the end-
user. 

4. Applications 

There  are  several  application  domains  which  will  be 
the  emerging  Internet  of  Things.  The 
impacted  by 
applications can be classified based on the type of network 
availability,  coverage,  scale,  heterogeneity,  repeatability, 
user  involvement  and  impact  [22].  We  categorize  the 
applications into four application domains: (1) Personal and 
Home; (2) Enterprise; (3) Utilities; and (4) Mobile. This is 
depicted  in  Figure  1  which  represents  Personal  and  Home 
IoT at the scale of an individual or home, Enterprise IoT at 
the  scale  of  a  community,  Utility  IoT  at  a  national  or 
regional  scale  and  Mobile  IoT  which  is  usually  spread 
across  other  domains  mainly  due 
the  nature  of 
connectivity  and  scale.  There  is  a  huge  crossover  in 
applications  and  the  use  of  data  between  the  domains.  For 
instance,  the  Personal  and  Home  IoT  produces  electricity 
usage  data  in  the  house  and  makes  it  available  to  the 
electricity (utility) company which can in turn optimizes the 
 

to 

 

7 

supply  and  demand  in  the  Utility  IoT.  Internet  enables 
sharing  of  data  between  different  service  providers  in  a 
seamless  manner  creating  multiple  business  opportunities. 
A few typical applications in each domain are given. 

4.1. Personal and Home 

The  sensor  information  collected  is  used  only  by  the 
individuals who directly own the network. Usually WiFi is 
used  as  the  backbone  enabling  higher  bandwidth  data 
(video) transfer as well as higher sampling rates (Sound). 

Ubiquitous  healthcare  [7]  has  been  envisioned  for  the 
past  two  decades.  IoT  gives  a  perfect  platform  to  realize 
this  vision  using  body  area  sensors  and  IoT  backend  to 
upload the data to  servers.  For instance, a  Smartphone can 
be  used  for  communication  along  with  several  interfaces 
sensors  measuring 
like  Bluetooth 
physiological  parameters.  So 
there  are  several 
applications  available  for  Apple  iOS,  Google  Android  and 
Windows  Phone  operating  system  that  measure  various 
parameters. However, it is yet to be centralized in the cloud 
for general physicians to access the same. 

interfacing 

far, 

for 

An  extension  of  the  personal  body  area  network  is 
creating  a  home  monitoring  system  for  aged-care,  which 
allows  the  doctor  to  monitor  patients  and  elderly  in  their 
homes thereby reducing  hospitalization costs through early 
intervention and treatment [23,24]. 

another 

Control  of  home  equipment  such  as  air  conditioners, 
refrigerators, washing machines etc., will allow better home 
and  energy  management.  This  will  see  consumers  become 
involved  in  IoT  revolution  in  the  same  manner  as  the 
Internet revolution itself [25,26]. Social networking is set to 
undergo 
of 
interconnected objects [27,28]. An interesting development 
will  be  using  a  Twitter  like  concept  where  individual 
‗Things‘  in  the  house  can  periodically  tweet  the  readings 
which  can  be  easily  followed  from  anywhere  creating  a 
TweetOT.  Although  this  provides  a  common  framework 
using  cloud  for 
information  access,  a  new  security 
paradigm will be required for this to be fully realized [29]. 

transformation  with 

billions 

4.2. Enterprise 

We  refer  to  the  ‗Network  of  Things‘  within  a  work 
environment as an enterprise based application. Information 
collected  from  such  networks  are  used  only  by  the  owners 
and  the  data  may  be  released  selectively.  Environmental 
monitoring  is  the  first  common  application  which  is 
implemented  to  keep  a  track  of  the  number  of  occupants 
and  manage  the  utilities  within  the  building  (e.g.,  HVAC, 
lighting).

One of the major IoT application areas which is already 
drawing attention is Smart Environment IoT [22,29]. There 
are  several  testbeds  being  implemented  and  many  more 
planned  in  the  coming  years.  Smart  environment  includes 
subsystems  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  the  characteristics 
from a technological perspective are listed briefly. It should 
be  noted  that  each  of  the  sub  domains  cover  many  focus

groups and the data will be shared. The applications or use-
cases  within  the  urban  environment  that  can  benefit  from 
the realisation of a smart city WSN capability are shown in 
Table  2. These  applications  are  grouped  according  to  their 
impact  areas.  This

of  its  impact  on  mobility,  productivity,  pollution;  and 
services  in  terms  of  critical  community  services  managed 
and provided by local government to city inhabitants. 

includes 

4.3. Utilities 

The  information  from  the  networks  in  this  application 
domain  are  usually  for  service  optimisation  rather  than 
consumer  consumption.  It  is  already  being  used  by  utility 
companies  (smart  meter  by  electricity  supply  companies) 
for  resource  management  in  order  to  optimise  cost  vs. 
profit.  These  are  made  up  of  very  extensive  networks 
(usually  laid  out  by  large  organisation  on  regional  and 
national scale)  for  monitoring critical  utilities and efficient 
resource  management.  The  backbone  network  used  can 
vary between cellular, WiFi and satellite communication. 

Smart  grid  and  smart  metering  is  another  potential  IoT 
application  which  is  being  implemented  around  the  world 
[40].  Efficient  energy  consumption  can  be  achieved  by 
continuously  monitoring  every  electricity  point  within  a 
house  and  using  this  information  to  modify  the  way 
electricity is consumed. This information at the city scale is 
used  for  maintaining  the  load  balance  within  the  grid 
ensuring high quality of service. 

Video based IoT [41] which integrates image processing, 
computer  vision  and  networking  frameworks  will  help 
develop  a  new  challenging  scientific  research  area  at  the 
intersection  of  video,  infrared,  microphone  and  network 
technologies.  Surveillance,  the  most  widely  used  camera 
network  applications,  helps 
identify 
suspicious  activities,  detect  left  luggage  and  monitor 

targets,

unauthorized access. Automatic behavior analysis and event 
detection  (as  part  of  sophisticated  video  analytics)  is  in  its 
infancy and breakthroughs are expected in the next decade

congestion  causing  freight  delays  and  delivery  schedule 
failures.  Dynamic  traffic  information  will  affect  freight 
movement, allow better planning and improved scheduling. 
The transport IoT  will enable the  use of large scale WSNs 

Figure 4: Conceptual IoT framework with Cloud Computing at the centre 

Water  network  monitoring  and  quality  assurance  of 
drinking  water  is  another  critical  application  that  is  being 
addressed  using  IoT.  Sensors  measuring  critical  water 
parameters  are  installed  at  important  locations  in  order  to 
ensure  high  supply  quality.  This  avoids  accidental 
contamination  among  storm  water  drains,  drinking  water 
and sewage disposal. The same network can be extended to 
monitor  irrigation  in  agricultural  land. The  network  is  also 
extended  for  monitoring  soil  parameters  which  allows 
informed decision making about agriculture [42]. 

4.4. Mobile 

Smart  transportation  and  smart  logistics  are  placed  in  a 
separate  domain  due  to  the  nature  of  data  sharing  and 
backbone  implementation  required.  Urban  traffic  is  the 
main  contributor  to  traffic  noise  pollution  and  a  major 
contributor to urban air quality degradation and greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Traffic  congestion  directly 
imposes 
significant  costs  on  economic  and  social  activities  in  most 
cities. Supply chain efficiencies and productivity, including 
just-in-time  operations,  are  severely  impacted  by  this 

loop  vehicle  detectors  employed  at 

for online monitoring of travel times, origin-destination (O-
D)  route  choice  behavior,  queue  lengths  and  air  pollutant 
and noise emissions. The IoT is likely to replace the traffic 
information  provided  by  the  existing  sensor  networks  of 
inductive 
the 
intersections  of  existing  traffic  control  systems.  They  will 
also  underpin  the  development  of  scenario-based  models 
for planning and design of mitigation and alleviation plans, 
as  well  as  improved  algorithms  for  urban  traffic  control, 
including  multi-objective  control  systems.  Combined  with 
information gathered from the urban traffic control system, 
valid  and  relevant  information  on  traffic  conditions  can  be 
presented to travelers [43]. 

The  prevalence  of  Bluetooth  technology  (BT)  devices 
reflects  the  current  IoT  penetration  in  a  number  of  digital 
products  such  as  mobile  phones,  car  hands-free  sets, 
navigation  systems,  etc.  BT  devices  emit  signals  with  a 
unique Media Access Identification (MAC-ID) number that 
can  be  read  by  BT  sensors  within  the  coverage  area. 
Readers placed at different locations can be used to identify 
the movement of the devices. Complemented by other data 
sources  such  as  traffic  signals,  or  bus  GPS,  research

problems  that can be addressed include vehicle  travel  time 
on motorway and arterial streets, dynamic (time dependent) 
O-D  matrices  on  the  network,  identification  of  critical 
intersections,  and  accurate  and  reliable  real  time  transport 
network  state  information  [39].  There  are  many  privacy 
concerns  by  such  usages  and  digital  forgetting  is  an 
emerging  domain  of  research  in  IoT  where  privacy  is  a 
concern [44]. 

logistics  management 

Another  important  application  in  mobile  IoT  domain  is 
efficient 
includes 
monitoring  the  items  being  transported  as  well  as  efficient 
transportation planning. The monitoring of items is carried 
out  more  locally,  say,  within  a  truck  replicating  enterprise 
domain  but  transport  planning  is  carried  out  using  a  large 
scale IoT network.  

[39].  This 

5. Cloud centric Internet of Things 

 
The  vision  of  IoT  can  be  seen  from  two  perspectives  –
‗Internet‘  centric  and  ‗Thing‘  centric.  The  Internet  centric 
architecture  will  involve  internet  services  being  the  main 
focus while data is contributed by the objects. In the object 
centric  architecture  [45],  the  smart  objects  take  the  center 
stage. In our work, we develop an Internet centric approach. 
A conceptual framework integrating the ubiquitous sensing 
devices and the applications is shown in  Figure 4. In order 
to  realize  the  full  potential  of  cloud  computing  as  well  as 
ubiquitous Sensing, a combined framework with  a cloud at 
the center seems to be most viable. This not only gives the 
flexibility  of  dividing  associated  costs  in  the  most  logical 
manner  but  is  also  highly  scalable.  Sensing  service 
providers can join the network and offer their data  using  a 
storage  cloud;  analytic  tool  developers  can  provide  their 
software  tools;  artificial  intelligence  experts  can  provide 
their  data  mining  and  machine  learning  tools  useful  in 
converting  information  to  knowledge  and  finally  computer 
graphics designer can offer a variety of  visualization tools. 
The  cloud  computing  can  offer 
these  services  as 
Infrastructures,  Platforms  or  Software  where  the  full 
potential  of  human  creativity  can  be  tapped  using  them  as 
services. This in some sense agrees with the ubicomp vision 
of  Weiser  as  well  as  Rogers  human  centric  approach.  The 
data  generated,  tools  used  and  the  visualization  created 
disappears into the background, tapping the full potential of 
the  Internet  of  Things  in  various  application  domains.  As 
can be seen from Figure 4, the Cloud integrates all ends of 
ubicomp  by  providing  scalable  storage,  computation  time 
and other tools to build new  businesses. In this section  we 
describe  the  cloud  platform  using  Manjrasoft  Aneka  and 
Microsoft  Azure  platforms  to  demonstrate  how  cloud 
integrates 
visualization 
paradigms.  Furthermore,  we  introduce  an  important  realm 
of interaction between cloud which is useful for combining 

computation 

storage, 

and 

 

10 

public  and  private  clouds  using  Aneka.  This  interaction  is 
critical  for  application  developers  in  order  to  bring  sensed 
information,  analytics  algorithms  and  visualization  under 
one single seamless framework. 

5.1. Aneka cloud computing platform 

is  a 

Aneka 

.NET-based  application  development 
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which can utilize storage and 
compute resources of both public and private clouds [46]. It 
offers a runtime environment and a set of APIs that enable 
developers  to  build  customized  applications  by  using 
multiple  programming  models  such  as  Task  Programming, 
Thread  Programming  and  MapReduce  Programming. 
Aneka  provides  a  number  of  services  that  allow  users  to 
control,  auto-scale,  reserve,  monitor  and  bill  users  for  the 
resources used by their applications. In the context of Smart 
Environment  application,  Aneka  PaaS  has  another 
important  characteristic  of  supporting  the  provisioning  of 
resources  on  public  clouds  such  as  Microsoft  Azure, 
Amazon  EC2,  and  GoGrid,  while  also  harnessing  private 
cloud  resources  ranging  from  desktops  and  clusters,  to 
virtual datacenters. An overview of Aneka PaaS is shown in 
Figure 5. For the application developer, the cloud service as 
well  as  ubiquitous  sensor  data  is  hidden  and  they  are 
provided  as  services  at  a  cost  by  the  Aneka  provisioning 
tool. 

Automatic  management  of  clouds  for  hosting  and 
delivering  IoT  services  as  SaaS  (Software-as-a-Service) 
applications  will  be  the  integrating  platform  of  the  Future 
Internet. There is a need to create data and service  sharing 
infrastructure  which  can  be  used  for  addressing  several 
application  scenarios.  For  example,  anomaly  detection  in 
sensed data carried out at the Application layer is a service 
which  can  be  shared  between  several  applications. 
Existing/new applications deployed as a hosted service and 
accessed over the Internet is referred to as SaaS. To manage 
SaaS applications on a large scale, the Platform as a Service 
(PaaS)  layer  needs  to  coordinate  the  cloud  (resource 
provisioning and application scheduling) without impacting 
the  Quality  of  Service  (QoS)  requirements  of  any 
application. The autonomic management components are to 
be  put  in  place  to  schedule  and  provision  resources  with  a 
higher  level  of  accuracy  to  support  IoT  applications.  This 
coordination  requires  the  PaaS  layer  to  support  autonomic 
management  capabilities  required  to  handle  the  scheduling 
of applications and resource provisioning such that the user 
QoS 
autonomic 
management  components  are  thus  put  in  place  to  schedule 
and  provision  resources  with  a  higher  level  of  accuracy  to 
support  IoT  applications.  The  autonomic  management 
system will tightly integrate the following services with the 
Aneka  framework:  Accounting,  Monitoring  and  Profiling, 
Scheduling,  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  Accounting, 
Monitoring,  and  Profiling  will  feed  the  sensors  of  the 

satisfied.  The 

requirements 

are

autonomic  manager,  while  the  managers  effectors  will 
control  Scheduling  and  Dynamic  Provisioning.  From  a 
logical  point  of  view  the  two  components  that  will  mostly 
take advantage from the introduction of autonomic features 
in  Aneka  are  the  application  scheduler  and  the  dynamic 
resource provisioning. 

5.2. Application scheduler and Dynamic Resource 
Provisioning in Aneka for IoT applications 

The  Aneka  scheduler  is  responsible  for  assigning  each 
resource to a task in an application  for execution based on 
user  QoS  parameters  and  the  overall  cost  for  the  service 
provider.  Depending  on 
the  computation  and  data 
requirements  of  each  Sensor  Application,  it  directs  the 
dynamic  resource-provisioning  component  to  instantiate  or 
terminate  a  specified  number  of  computing,  storage,  and 
network resources while maintaining a queue of tasks to be 
scheduled.  This  logic  is  embedded  as  multi-objective 
application scheduling algorithms. The scheduler is able to 
mange  resource  failures  by  reallocting  those  tasks  to  other 
suitable Cloud resources.

based 

on 

environments 

The  Dynamic  Resource  Provisioning  component 
implements  the  logic  for  provisioning  and  managing 
virtualised  resources  in  the  private  and  public  cloud 
computing 
resource 
requirements as directed by the application scheduler. This 
is  achieved  by  dynamically  negotiating  with  the  Cloud 
Infrastructure  as  a  Service  (IaaS)  providers  for  the  right 
kind  of  resource  for  a  certain  time  and  cost  by  taking  into 
account  the  past  execution  history  of  applications  and 
budget availability. This decision is made at run-time, when 
SaaS applications continuously send requests  to the  Aneka 
cloud platform [47]. 

the 

6. IoT Sensor Data Analytics SaaS using Aneka and 
Microsoft Azure 

 Microsoft  Azure  is  a  cloud  platform,  offered  by 
Microsoft,  includes  four  components  as  summarized  in 
[46].  There  are  several  advantages  for  integrating  Azure 
and  Aneka.  Aneka  can  launch  any  number  of  instances  on 
the  Azure  cloud  to  run  their  applications.  Essentially,  it 
provides  the  provisioning  infrastructure.  Similarly,  Aneka 

 

provides  advanced  PaaS  features  as  shown  in  Figure  5.  It 
provides  multiple  programming  models  (Task,  Thread, 
MapReduce), 
services,  workload 
management  services,  dynamic  provisioning,  QoS  based 
scheduling and flexible billing.

As  discussed  earlier,  trealizese  thubicompmp  vision, 
tools  and  data  needs  to  be  shared  between  application 
developers to create new apps. There are two major hurdles 
in  such  an  implementation.  Firstly,  interaction  between 
clouds becomes critical which is addressed by Aneka in the 
InterCloud  model.  Aneka  support  for  InterCloud  model 
enables 
the  creation  of  a  hybrid  Cloud  computing 
environment  which  combines  the  resources  of  private  and 
public Clouds. That is, whenever private Cloud is unable to 
meet  application  QoS  requirements,  Aneka  leases  extra 
capability  from  public  Cloud  to  ensure  that  application  is 
able  to  execute  within  a  specified  deadline  in  a  seamless 
manner  [47].  Secondly,  data  analytics  and  artificial 

intelligence  tools  are  computationally  demanding  which 
requires  huge  resources.  For  data  analytics  and  artificial 
intelligence  tools,  the  Aneka  task  programming  model 
provides  the  ability  of  expressing  applications  as  a 
collection  of  independent  tasks.  Each  task  can  perform 
different  operations,  or  the  same  operation  on  different 
data,  and  can  be  executed  in  any  order  by  the  runtime 
environment.  In  order  to  demonstrate  this,  we  have  used  a 
scenario  where  there  are  multiple  analytics  algorithm  and 
multiple  data  sources.  A  schematic  of  the  interaction 
between  Aneka  and  Azure  is  given  in  Figure  6  where 
Aneka  Worker  Containers  are  deployed  as  instances  of 
Azure  Worker  Role.  The  Aneka  Master  Container  will  be 
deployed  in  the  on-premises  private  cloud,  while  Aneka 
Worker  Containers  will  be  run  as  instances  of  Microsoft 
Azure  Worker  Role.  As  shown  in  the  Figure  6,  there  are 
two  types  of  Microsoft  Azure  Worker  Roles  used.  These 
are  the  Aneka  Worker  Role  and  Message  Proxy  Role.  In 
this  case,  one  instance  of  the  Message  Proxy  Role  and  at 
least one instance of the Aneka Worker Role are deployed. 
The  maximum  number  of  instances  of  the  Aneka  Worker 
Role  that  can  be  launched  is  limited  by  the  subscription 
offer of Microsoft Azure Service that a user selects. In this 
deployment scenario, when a user submits an application to 
the  Aneka  Master,  the  job  units  will  be  scheduled  by  the 
Aneka  Master  by  leveraging  on-premises  Aneka  Workers, 
if  they  exist,  and  Aneka  Worker  instances  on  Microsoft 
Azure  simultaneously.  When  Aneka  Workers  finish  the 
execution  of  Aneka  work  units,  they  will  send  the  results

back to Aneka Master, and then Aneka Master will send the 
result back to the user application. 

7. Open Challenges and Future Directions 

The  proposed  Cloud  centric  vision  comprises  of  a 
flexible  and  open  architecture  that  is  user  centric  and 
enables different players to interact in the IoT framework. It 
allows  interaction  in  a  manner  suitable  for  their  own 
requirements, rather than the IoT being thrust upon them. In 
this  way,  the  framework  includes  provisions  to  meet 
different requirements for data ownership, security, privacy, 
and sharing of information.  

Some  open  challenges  are  discussed  based  on  the  IoT 
elements  presented  earlier.  The  challenges  include  IoT 
specific  challenges  such  as  privacy,  participatory  sensing, 
data  analytics,  GIS  based  visualization  and  Cloud 
computing  apart  from  the  standard  WSN  challenges 
including 
security, 
protocols,  and  Quality  of  Service.  The  end  goal  is  to  have 
Plug  n‘  Play  smart  objects  which  can  be  deployed  in  any 
environment with an interoperable backbone allowing them 
to  blend  with  other 
them. 
Standardization  of  frequency  bands  and  protocols  plays  a 
pivotal role in accomplishing this goal.

A  roadmap  of  key  developments  in  IoT  research  in  the 
context  of  pervasive  applications  is  shown  in  Figure  8, 
which  includes  the  technology  drivers  and  key  application 
outcomes expected in the next decade [8]. The section ends 
with  a  few  international  initiatives  in  the  domain  which 
could  play  a  vital  role  in  the  success  of  this  rapidly 
emerging technology. 

7.1. Architecture 

the  challenges  particularly 

Overall architecture followed at the initial stages of  IoT 
research  will  have  a  severe  bearing  on  the  field  itself  and 
needs  to  be  investigated.  Most  of  the  work  relating  to  IoT 
architecture  has  been  from  the  wireless  sensor  networks 
perspective [48]. European Union projects of SENSEI [49] 
and Internet of Things-Architecture (IoT-A) [50] have been 
addressing 
from  WSN 
perspective and  have been very successful  for defining the 
architecture  for  different  applications.  We  are  referring 
architecture  to  overall  IoT  where  the  user  is  at  the  center 
and will enable the use of data and infrastructure to develop 
new  applications.  An  architecture  based  on  cloud 
computing  at  the  center  has  been  proposed  in  this  paper. 
However,  this  may  not  be  the  best  option  for  every 
application  domain  particularly  for  defense  where  human 
intelligence  is  relied  upon.  Although  we  see  cloud  centric 
architecture  to  be  the  best  where  cost  based  services  are 
required,  other  architectures  should  be  investigated  for 
different application domains. 

feature 

Another 

required 

important 

for  seamless 
independent IoT working architecture is SaaS to be updated 
by  the  developers  dynamically.  In  this  example,  analytics 
tools (usually in the form of DLLs) have to be updated and 
used  by  several  clients.  Due  to  administrative  privileges 
provided  by  Azure,  this  becomes  a  non-trivial  task. 
Management  Extensibility  Framework  (MEF)  provides  a 
simple solution to the problem. The MEF is a composition 
layer for .NET that improves the flexibility, maintainability 
and  testability  of  large  applications.  MEF  can  be  used  for 
third-party plugin, or it can bring the benefits of a loosely-
coupled  plugin-like  architecture  for  regular  applications.  It 
is a library for creating lightweight, extensible applications. 
It  allows  application  developers  to  discover  and  use 
extensions  with  no  configuration  required.  It  also  lets 
extension  developers  easily  encapsulate  code  and  avoid 
fragile hard dependencies. MEF not only allows extensions 
to be reused  within applications, but across applications as 
well. MEF provides a standard way for the host application 
to  expose 
itself  and  consume  external  extensions. 
Extensions, by their nature, can be reused amongst different 
applications.  However,  an  extension  could  still  be 
implemented  in  a  way  that  is  application-specific.  The 
extensions themselves can depend on one another and MEF 
will make sure they are wired together in the correct order. 
One  of  the  key  design  goals  of  IoT  web  application  is,  it 
would  be  extensible  and  MEF  provides  this  solution.  With 
MEF  we  can  use  different  algorithms  (as  and  when  it 
becomes  available)  for  IoT  data  analytics:  e.g.  drop  an 

Figure 7: System Context Diagram 

analytics  assembly  into  a  folder  and  it  instantly  becomes 
available to the application. The system context diagram of 
the developed data analytics is given in Figure 7.

environment  needs  to  simultaneously  meet  competing 
demands  of  multiple  sensing  modalities.  This  has 
implications  on  network  traffic,  data  storage  and  energy 
utilization.  Importantly,  this  encompasses  both  fixed  and 
mobile sensing infrastructure [51] as well as continuous and 
random sampling. A generalized framework is required for 
data  collection  and  modelling  that  effectively  exploits 
spatial and temporal characteristics of the data, both in the 
sensing  domain  as  well  as  the  associated  transform 
domains.  For  example,  urban  noise  mapping  needs  an 
uninterrupted  collection  of  noise  levels  using  battery 
powered  nodes  using  fixed  infrastructure  and  participatory 
sensing  [51]  as  a  key  component  for  health  and  quality  of 
life services for its inhabitants.

ubiquitous  sensing  context,  this  has  implications  for  data 
compression, network traffic and the distribution of sensors. 
Compressive  wireless  sensing  (CWS)  utilizes  synchronous 
communication  to  reduce  the  transmission  power  of  each 
sensor  [53];  transmitting  noisy  projections  of  data  samples 
to a central location for aggregation. 

7.3. Secure reprogrammable networks and Privacy 

Security will be a major concern wherever networks are 
deployed at large scale. There can be many ways the system 
could  be  attacked  -  disabling  the  network  availability; 
pushing erroneous data into the network; accessing personal 
information;  etc.  The  three  physical  components  of  IoT  - 
RFID,  WSN  and  cloud  are  vulnerable  to  such  attacks. 
Security is critical to any network [54,55] and the first line 
of defence against data corruption is cryptography. 

Of the three, RFID (particularly passive) seems to be the 
most  vulnerable as it allows  person tracking as  well as  the 

 

objects  and  no  high  level  intelligence  can  be  enabled  on 
these devices [15]. These complex problems however have 
solutions  which  can  be  provided  using  cryptographic 
methods and deserves more research before they are widely 
accepted. 

nodes 

Against  outsider  attackers,  encryption  ensures  data 
confidentiality,  whereas  message  authentication  codes 
ensure  data  integrity  and  authenticity  [56].  Encryption, 
however, does not protect against insider malicious attacks, 
to  address  which  non-cryptographic  means  are  needed, 
particularly  in  WSNs.  Also,  periodically,  new  sensor 
applications need to be installed, or existing ones need to be 
updated. This is done by remote wireless reprogramming of 
all 
network 
reprogramming  consists  solely  of  a  data  dissemination 
protocol that distributes code to all the nodes in the network 
without authentication, which is a security threat. A secure 
reprogramming  protocol  allows  the  nodes  to  authenticate 
every code update and prevent malicious installation. Most 
such  protocols  (e.g.,  [57])  are  based  on  the  benchmark 
protocol  Deluge  [58].  We  need  cryptographic  add-ons  to 
Deluge  which  lays  foundation  for  more  sophisticated 
algorithms to be developed. 

network.  Traditional

the 

Security  in  the  cloud  is  another  important  area  of 
research  which  will  need  more  attention.  Along  with  the 
presence  of  the  data  and  tools,  cloud  also  handles 
economics  of  IoT  which  will  make  it  a  bigger  threat  from 
attackers.  Security  and  identity  protection  becomes  critical 
in  hybrid  clouds  where  a  private  as  well  as  public  clouds 
will be used by businesses [59]. 

Remembering forever in the context of IoT raises many 
privacy issues as the data collected can be used in positive 
(for  advertisement  services)  and  negative  ways  (for 
defamation).  Digital  forgetting  could  emerge  as  one  of  the 
key  areas  of  research  to  address  the  concerns  and  the 
development  of  appropriate  framework  to  protect  personal 
data [44]. 

segments  often  constitute  ‗gaps‘  in  resource  guarantee  due 
to resource allocation and management ability constraints in 
shared  wireless  media.  Quality  of  Service 
in  cloud 
Computing  is  another  major  research  area  which  will 
require  more  and  more  attention  as  the  data  and  tools 
become  available  on  clouds.  Dynamic  scheduling  and 
resource  allocation  algorithms  based  on  particle  swarm 
optimization  are  being  developed.  For  high  capacity 
applications  and  as  IoT  grows,  this  could  become  a 
bottleneck. 

7.5. New protocols 

The  protocols  at  the  sensing  end  of  IoT  will  play  a  key 
role  in  complete  realisation.  They  form  the  backbone  for 
the data tunnel between sensors and the outer world. For the 
system  to  work  efficiently,  and  energy  efficient  MAC 
protocol  and  appropriate  routing  protocol  are  critical. 
Several  MAC  protocols  have  been  proposed  for  various 
domains  with  TDMA  (collision  free),  CSMA  (low  traffic 
efficiency)  and  FDMA 
requires 
additional circuitry in nodes) schemes available to the user 
[67].  None  of  them  are  accepted  as  a  standard  and  with 
more  ‗things‘  available  this  scenario  is  going  to  get  more 
cluttered which requires further research. 

(collision 

free  but 

An  individual  sensor  can  drop  out  for  a  number  of 
reasons, so the network must be self-adapting and allow for 
multi-path routing. Multi-hop routing protocols are used in 
mobile  ad  hoc  networks  and  terrestrial  WSNs  [68].  They 
are  mainly  divided  into  three  categories  -  data  centric, 
location  based  and  hierarchical,  again  based  on  different 
application  domains.  Energy  is  the  main  consideration  for 
the existing routing protocols. In the case of  IoT, it should 
be noted that a backbone  will be available and the number 
of hops in the multi-hop scenario will be limited. In such a 
scenario,  the  existing  routing  protocols  should  suffice  in 
practical implementation with minor modifications. 

7.4. Quality of Service 

7.6. Participatory Sensing 

Heterogeneous  networks  are  (by  default)  multi-service; 
providing  more  than  one  distinct  application  or  service. 
This  implies  not  only  multiple  traffic  types  within  the 
network, but also the ability of a single network to support 
all  applications  without  QoS  compromise  [60].  There  are 
two  application  classes:  throughput  and  delay  tolerant 
elastic traffic of (e.g. monitoring weather parameters at low 
sampling  rates),  and  the  bandwidth  and  delay  sensitive 
inelastic (real-time) traffic (e.g. noise or traffic monitoring), 
which  can  be  further  discriminated  by  data-related 
applications  (e.g.  high-vs.-low  resolution  videos)  with 
different  QoS  requirements.  Therefore,  a  controlled, 
optimal  approach  to  serve  different  network  traffics,  each 
with  its  own  application  QoS  needs  is  required  [61].  It  is 
not easy to provide QoS guarantees in wireless networks, as 

A  number  of  projects  have  begun  to  address  the 
development  of  people  centric  (or  participatory)  sensing 
platforms  [51,62-64].  As  noted  earlier,  people  centric 
sensing  offers  the  possibility  of  low  cost  sensing  of  the 
environment localized to the user. It can therefore give the 
closest indication of environmental parameters experienced 
by  the  user.  It  has  been  noted  that  environmental  data 
collected by  user forms a social currency [65]. This results 
in  more  timely  data  being  generated  compared  to  the  data 
available  through  a  fixed  infrastructure  sensor  network. 
Most  importantly,  it  is  the  opportunity  for  the  user  to 
provide 
their  experience  of  a  given 
environmental parameter that offers valuable information in 
the form of context associated with a given event. 

feedback  on

The  limitations  of  people  centric  sensing  place  new 
significance  on  the reference  data role provided by a  fixed 
infrastructure  IoT  as  a  backbone.  The  problem  of  missing 
samples  is  a  fundamental  limitation  of  people  centric 
sensing.  Relying  on  users  volunteering  data  and  on  the 
inconsistent  gathering  of  samples  obtained  across  varying 
times  and  varying  locations  (based  on  a  user's  desired 
participation  and  given  location  or  travel  path),  limits  the 
ability to produce meaningful data for any applications and 
policy decisions. Only in addressing issues and implications 
of  data  ownership,  privacy  and  appropriate  participation 
incentives,  can  such  a  platform  achieve  genuine  end-user 
engagement.  Further  sensing  modalities  can  be  obtained 
through  the  addition  of  sensor  modules  attached  to  the 
phone  for  application  specific  sensing,  such  as  air  quality 
sensors  [66]  or  biometric  sensors.  In  such  scenarios,  smart 
phones  become  critical  IoT  nodes  which  are  connected  to 
the cloud on one end and several sensors at the other end. 

7.7. Data mining 

Extracting  useful  information  from  a  complex  sensing 
environment at different spatial and temporal resolutions is 
a  challenging  research  problem  in  artificial  intelligence. 
Current  state-of-the-art  methods  use  shallow  learning 
methods  where  pre-defined  events  and  data  anomalies  are 
extracted  using  supervised  and  unsupervised  learning  [69]. 
The next level of learning involves inferring local activities 
by  using  temporal  information  of  events  extracted  from 
shallow  learning.  The  ultimate  vision  will  be  to  detect 
complex events based on larger spatial and longer temporal 
scales  based  on  the  two  levels  before.  The  fundamental 
research  problem 
sensing 
environments of this nature is how to simultaneously learn 
representations of events and activities at multiple levels of 
complexity  (i.e.,  events,  local  activities  and  complex 
activities). An emerging focus in machine learning research 
has been the field of deep learning [70], which aims to learn 
multiple  layers  of  abstraction  that  can  be  used  to  interpret 
given  data.  Furthermore,  the  resource  constraints  in  sensor 
networks create novel challenges for deep learning in terms 
of  the  need  for  adaptive,  distributed  and  incremental 
learning techniques.

technologies 

As  new  display 

creative 
visualization  will  be  enabled.  The  evolution  from  CRT  to 
Plasma,  LCD,  LED,  and  AMOLED  displays  have  given 
rise  to  highly  efficient  data  representation  (using  touch 
interface)  with  the  user  being  able  to  navigate  the  data 
better  than  ever  before.  With  emerging  3D  displays,  this 
area  is  certain  to  have  more  research  and  development 
opportunities.  However,  the  data  which  comes  out  of 
ubiquitous  computing  is  not  always  ready  for  direct

consumption  using  visualization  platforms  and  requires 
further processing. The scenario becomes very complex for 
heterogeneous spatio-temporal data [71]. New visualization 
schemes  for representation of heterogeneous sensors in 3D 
landscape that varies temporally have to be developed [72]. 
Another  challenge  of  visualizing  data  collected  within  IoT 
is that they are geo-related and are sparsely distributed. To 
cope with such a challenge, a framework based on Internet 
GIS is required. 

7.9. Cloud Computing 

An  integrated  IoT  and  Cloud  computing  applications  
enabling the creation of smart environments such as Smart 
Cities  need  to  be  able  to  (a)  combine  services  offered  by 
multiple  stakeholders  and  (b)  scale  to  support  a  large 
number  of  users  in  a  reliable  and  decentralized  manner. 
They  need  to  be  able  operate  in  both  wired  and  wireless 
network  environments  and  deal  with  constraints  such  as 
access  devices  or  data  sources  with  limited  power  and 
unreliable  connectivity.  The  Cloud  application  platforms 
need  to  be  enhanced  to  support  (a)  the  rapid  creation  of 
applications  by  providing  domain  specific  programming 
tools  and  environments  and  (b)  seamless  execution  of 
applications  harnessing  capabilities  of  multiple  dynamic 
and  heterogeneous  resources  to  meet  quality  of  service 
requirements of diverse users.  

The Cloud resource management and scheduling system 
should  be  able  to  dynamically  prioritize    requests  and 
provision resources such that critical requests are served in 
real  time.  To  deliver  results  in  a  reliable  manner,  the 
scheduler  needs  to  be  augmented  with  task  duplication 
algorithms  for failure  management. Specifically, the  Cloud 
application  scheduling  algorithms  need  to  exhibit  the 
following capability: 
1.  Multi-objective optimization: The scheduling algorithms 
should  be  able  to  deal  with  QoS  parameters  such  as 
response  time,  cost  of  service  usage,  maximum  number 
of  resources  available  per  unit  price,  and  penalties  for 
service degradation.  

2.  Task  duplication  based  fault  tolerance:  Critical  tasks  of 
an  application  will  be  transparently  replicated  and 
executed  on  different  resources  so  that  if  one  resource 
fails  to  complete  the  task,  the  replicated  version  can  be 
used. This logic is crucial in real-time tasks that need to 
be processed to deliver services in a timely manner.   

7.10. International Activities 

Internet  of  Things  activities  is  gathering  momentum 
around  the  world,  with  numerous  initiatives  underway 
across 
levels  of 
government,  as  key  stakeholders  seek  to  map  a  way 
forward for the coordinated realization of this technological 
evolution.  In  Europe,  substantial  effort  is  underway  to 

industry,  academia  and  various 

 

consolidate  the  cross-domain  activities  of  research  groups 
and  organizations,  spanning  M2M,  WSN  and  RFID  into  a 
unified  IoT  framework.  Supported  by 
the  European 
Commission 7thFramework program (EU-FP7) this includes 
the  Internet  of  Things  European  Research  Cluster  (IERC). 
Encompassing a number of EU FP7 projects, its objectives 
are: to establish a cooperation platform and research vision 
for IoT activities in Europe and become a contact point for 
IoT  research  in  the  world.  It  includes  projects  such  as 
CASAGRAS2, a consortium  of international partners  from 
Europe, the USA, China, Japan and Korea exploring issues 
surrounding  RFID  and  its  role  in  realizing  the  Internet  of 
Things.  As  well,  IERC  includes  the  Internet  of  Things 
Architecture  (IoT-A)  project  established  to  determine  an 
architectural  reference  model  for  the  interoperability  of 
Internet-of-Things  systems  and  key  building  blocks  to 
achieve this. At the same time, the IoT Initiative (IoT-i) is a 
coordinated  action  established  to  support  the  development 
of  the  European  IoT  community.  The  IoT-i  project  brings 
together a consortium of partners to create a joint strategic 
and technical vision for the IoT in Europe that encompasses 
the  currently  fragmented  sectors  of  the  IoT  domain 
holistically.  Simultaneously,  the  SmartSantander  project  is 
developing a city scale IoT testbed for research and service 
provision  deployed  across  the  city  of  Santander,  Spain,  as 
well  as  sites  located  in  the  UK,  Germany,  Serbia  and 
Australia. 

At the same time large scale initiatives are underway in 
Japan,  Korea,  the  USA  and  Australia,  where  industry, 
associated  organizations  and  government  departments  are 
collaborating  on  various  programs,  advancing  related 
capabilities  towards  an  IoT.  This  includes  smart  city 
initiatives,  smart  grid  programs 
incorporating  smart 
metering technologies and roll-out of high speed broadband 
infrastructure.  A  continuing  development  of  RFID  related 
technologies by industry and consortiums such as the Auto-
ID  lab  (founded  at  MIT  and  now  with  satellite  labs  at 
leading  universities  in  South  Korea,  China,  Japan,  United 
Kingdom,  Australia and Switzerland) dedicated to creating 
the  Internet  of  Things  using  RFID  and  Wireless  Sensor 
Networks  are  being  pursued.  Significantly,  the  need  for 
consensus  around  IoT  technical  issues  has  seen  the 
establishment  of  the  Internet  Protocol  for  Smart  Objects 
(IPSO)  Alliance,  now  with  more 
than  60  member 
companies  from  leading  technology,  communications  and 
energy  companies,  working  with  standards  bodies,  such  as 
IETF, IEEE and ITU to specify new IP-based technologies 
and  promote  industry  consensus  for  assembling  the  parts 
for  the  Internet  of  Things.  Substantial  IoT  development 
activity is also underway in China, with its 12th Five Year 
Plan 
investment  and 
development  to  be  focused  on:  smart  grid;  intelligent 
transportation;  smart  logistics;  smart  home;  environment 
and safety testing; industrial control and automation; health 
care; fine agriculture; finance and service; military defense.

This  is  being  aided  by  the  establishment  of  an  Internet  of 
Things  center  in  Shanghai  (with  a  total  investment  over 
US$  100million)  to  study  technologies  and  industrial 
standards.  An  industry  fund  for  Internet  of  Things,  and  an 
Internet of Things Union ‗Sensing China‘ has been founded 
in  Wuxi,  initiated  by  more  than  60  telecom  operators, 
institutes and companies who are the primary drivers of the 
industry. 

8. Summary and Conclusions 

The  proliferation  of  devices  with  communicating-
actuating  capabilities  is  bringing  closer  the  vision  of  an 
Internet  of  Things,  where  the  sensing  and  actuation 
functions  seamlessly  blend  into  the  background  and  new 
capabilities  are  made  possible  through  access  of  rich  new 
information  sources.  The  evolution  of  the  next  generation 
mobile system  will depend on the creativity of  the users in 
designing  new  applications.  IoT  is  an  ideal  emerging 
technology  to  influence  this  domain  by  providing  new 
evolving data and the required computational resources  for 
creating revolutionary apps.  

Presented  here  is  a  user-centric  cloud  based  model  for 
approaching this goal through the interaction of private and 
public clouds. In this manner, the needs of the end-user are 
brought to the fore. Allowing for the necessary flexibility to 
meet  the  diverse  and  sometimes  competing  needs  of 
different  sectors,  we  propose  a  framework  enabled  by  a 
scalable cloud to provide the capacity to utilize the IoT. The 
framework  allows  networking,  computation,  storage  and 
visualization themes separate thereby allowing independent 
growth  in  every  sector  but  complementing  each  other  in  a 
shared  environment.  The 
is 
underway  in  each  of  these  themes  will  not  be  adversely 
affected  with  Cloud  at  its  center.  In  proposing  the  new 
framework  associated  challenges  have  been  highlighted 
ranging from appropriate interpretation and visualization of 
the  vast  amounts  of  data,  through  to  the  privacy,  security 
and  data  management  issues  that  must  underpin  such  a 
platform  in  order  for  it  to  be  genuinely  viable.  The 
consolidation  of  international  initiatives  is  quite  clearly 
towards  an  IoT,  providing  an 
accelerating  progress 
overarching  view  for 
integration  and  functional 
elements that can deliver an operational IoT.
