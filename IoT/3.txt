Abstract 
 
With increasing popularity of the IoT (Internet of Things) and devices getting smarter day by day, this paper presents an 
idea to reform the existing access control systems. This approach of enhancing the access control system ensures that the 
system is wireless thereby reducing wiring issues. The prototype described in this paper has the provision of accepting 
inputs from a smart card reader (RFID reader) or a biometric sensor. These inputs are processed inside the controller 
(TM4C123GXL-based on ARM Cortex-M4). If the inputs are found to be valid, access is granted to the user and the logs 
are  wirelessly  transmitted  to  the  computer  using  a  WiFi  module  (CC3100).  Machine  learning  algorithms  are 
implemented to monitor and analyse collected data.

1. Introduction 
 
1 With  increasing  demand  from  the  industry  for  better 
access  control  systems,  this  paper  is  an  attempt  to  make 
the  conventional  access  control  systems  smarter  and 
thereby decreasing the risks of breaking in into the places 
where  these  access  control  systems  will  be  installed.  EK-
TM4C123GXL  is  the  development  board  which  is  used. 
Data from RFID reader and Biometric sensors are serially 
transmitted to the microcontroller. If valid fingerprint data 
or  valid  card  no.  is  received,  the  microcontroller  sends  a 
signal to the WiFi module1. The WiFi module2 present at 
the door receives that  signal  and trips the relay according 
to  the  signal  received.  This  is  how  the  door  opens.  Also 
the  WiFi  module  sends  a  signal  to  the  PC  via  the  same 
WiFi  network.  Hence  the  logs  of  people  trying  to  access 
the door are maintained in the PC.

The smart card of the person is read by the RFID reader or 
wiegand  reader  near  the  door.  The  reader  typically 
transmits  a  signal  of  125  KHz.  The  card  is  a  passive 
component  with  no  power  source.  When  it  comes  in 
proximity  of  the  reader,  the  reader  induces  some  voltage 
and hence the card transmits a unique 16 bit card number 
to  the  reader.  The  reader  then  transmits  this  card  number 
to  the  microcontroller  via  the  two  data  pins(D0,D1). 
Wiegand  protocol  is  used  for  transmission.  The  26  bit 
wiegand format is shown below.In the figure 3, the 1st bit 
is  the  even  parity  bit.  This  even  parity  is  for  the  first  13 
bits. This bit is followed by the 8 bit facility code(0-255). 
The facility code provides on more layer of security. This 
code is used in cases where the employees of 2 companies 
have the same card number. But they can be differentiated 
with the help of the facility code. The 8 bit facility code is 
followed by a 16 bit card number (0-65535). The last bit is 
the odd parity bit. The odd parity bit accounts for bits 14-
26.

biometric  key  or  mathematical  representation.  No  image 
of a fingerprint is ever saved, only a series of numbers (a 
binary code), which is used for verification. The algorithm 
cannot be reconverted to an image, so no one can duplicate 
your  fingerprints.  The  fingerprint  scanner  gives  the  serial 
data  to  the  microcontroller.  The  data  transmission  takes 
place 
serially  via  UART(Universal  Asynchronours 
receiver transmitter ).

The eight wiegand pins are as follows:  

1. Vcc 
2. Wiegand data D0 
3. Wiegand data D1 
4. Wiegand Red 
5. Wiegand Green 
6. Wiegand Buzzer 
7. Wiegand tamper 
8. Ground. 
 
Explanation of pins 
  
1.  Vcc: This pin provides +5/+12 Volts to the reader. 
2.  Data D0: Data D0 at this pin. 
3.  Data D1: Data D1 at this pin. 
4.  Wiegand  red:  Switches  on  the  red  LED  on  the 

wiegand reader indicating access is denied. 

5.  Wiegand  green:  Switches  on  the  green  LED  on  the 

wiegand reader indicating access is granted. 

6.  Wiegand buzzer: The buzzer is switched on for finite 
time  duration  each  time  the  access  is  denied  or 
granted. 

7.  Wiegand  tamper:  If  the  wiegand  reader  is  tampered, 
the reader gives a high signal as output on the tamper 
pin. This pin is then connected to the micro-controller 
which controls the further action to be taken.  

8.  Wiegand ground: It provides ground or 0 Volts to the 

wiegand reader.  

 
The Wiegand interface uses three wires, one of which is a 
common  ground  and  two  of  which  are  data  transmission 
wires  usually  called  DATA0  and  DATA1,  alternately 
labeled  "D0"  and  "D1"  or  "Data  Low"  and  "Data  High". 
When  no  data  is  being  sent,  both  DATA0  and  DATA1 
are pulled  up to  the  "high"  voltage  level  —  usually 
+5 VDC. When a 0 is sent the DATA0 wire is pulled to a 
low voltage while the DATA1 wire stays at a high voltage. 
When  a  1  is  sent  the  DATA1  wire  is  pulled  to  a  low 
voltage while DATA0 stays at a high voltage. 
 
 2.2 Biometric Sensor 
 
The biometric scanner used is a fingerprint scanner. The A 
fingerprint scanner system has two basic jobs -- it needs to 
get  an  image  of  your  finger,  and  it  needs  to  determine 
whether  the  pattern  of  ridges  and  valleys  in  this  image 
matches  the  pattern  of  ridges  and  valleys  in  pre-scanned 
images. Only specific characteristics,  which are unique to 
every  fingerprint,  are  filtered  and  saved  as  an  encrypted

The fingerprint scanner shown in the figure above is from 
ADH-TECH  and  it  communicates  at  TTL  levels  serially. 
The  module  itself  does  all  of  the  heavy  lifting  behind 
reading  and  identifying  the  fingerprints  with  an  on-board 
optical sensor and 32-bit CPU. The module can only store 
up  to  20  different  fingerprints  but  is  capable  of  360° 
fingerprint 
recognition  and  download  and  upload 
templates  using  serial  interface.  The  module  is  small  and 
easy to mount using two mounting tabs on the side of the 
sensor.  The  on-board  JST-SH  connector  has  four  signals: 
Vcc, GND, Tx, Rx.

Abstract 
 
With increasing popularity of the IoT (Internet of Things) and devices getting smarter day by day, this paper presents an 
idea to reform the existing access control systems. This approach of enhancing the access control system ensures that the 
system is wireless thereby reducing wiring issues. The prototype described in this paper has the provision of accepting 
inputs from a smart card reader (RFID reader) or a biometric sensor. These inputs are processed inside the controller 
(TM4C123GXL-based on ARM Cortex-M4). If the inputs are found to be valid, access is granted to the user and the logs 
are  wirelessly  transmitted  to  the  computer  using  a  WiFi  module  (CC3100).  Machine  learning  algorithms  are 
implemented to monitor and analyse collected data. 
 
Keywords: IoT, Access Control , Security, Wireless, WiFi, Machine learning. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
1 With  increasing  demand  from  the  industry  for  better 
access  control  systems,  this  paper  is  an  attempt  to  make 
the  conventional  access  control  systems  smarter  and 
thereby decreasing the risks of breaking in into the places 
where  these  access  control  systems  will  be  installed.  EK-
TM4C123GXL  is  the  development  board  which  is  used. 
Data from RFID reader and Biometric sensors are serially 
transmitted to the microcontroller. If valid fingerprint data 
or  valid  card  no.  is  received,  the  microcontroller  sends  a 
signal to the WiFi module1. The WiFi module2 present at 
the door receives that  signal  and trips the relay according 
to  the  signal  received.  This  is  how  the  door  opens.  Also 
the  WiFi  module  sends  a  signal  to  the  PC  via  the  same 
WiFi  network.  Hence  the  logs  of  people  trying  to  access 
the door are maintained in the PC. 

2.1 RFID Reader 
 

Fig 2: RFID reader 

 

 

 

The smart card of the person is read by the RFID reader or 
wiegand  reader  near  the  door.  The  reader  typically 
transmits  a  signal  of  125  KHz.  The  card  is  a  passive 
component  with  no  power  source.  When  it  comes  in 
proximity  of  the  reader,  the  reader  induces  some  voltage 
and hence the card transmits a unique 16 bit card number 
to  the  reader.  The  reader  then  transmits  this  card  number 
to  the  microcontroller  via  the  two  data  pins(D0,D1). 
Wiegand  protocol  is  used  for  transmission.  The  26  bit 
wiegand format is shown below.In the figure 3, the 1st bit 
is  the  even  parity  bit.  This  even  parity  is  for  the  first  13 
bits. This bit is followed by the 8 bit facility code(0-255). 
The facility code provides on more layer of security. This 
code is used in cases where the employees of 2 companies 
have the same card number. But they can be differentiated 
with the help of the facility code. The 8 bit facility code is 
followed by a 16 bit card number (0-65535). The last bit is 
the odd parity bit. The odd parity bit accounts for bits 14-
26.

biometric  key  or  mathematical  representation.  No  image 
of a fingerprint is ever saved, only a series of numbers (a 
binary code), which is used for verification. The algorithm 
cannot be reconverted to an image, so no one can duplicate 
your  fingerprints.  The  fingerprint  scanner  gives  the  serial 
data  to  the  microcontroller.  The  data  transmission  takes 
place 
serially  via  UART(Universal  Asynchronours 
receiver transmitter ). 
 
 

 

Fig 3.Wiegand protocol 

The eight wiegand pins are as follows:  

1. Vcc 
2. Wiegand data D0 
3. Wiegand data D1 
4. Wiegand Red 
5. Wiegand Green 
6. Wiegand Buzzer 
7. Wiegand tamper 
8. Ground. 
 
Explanation of pins 
  
1.  Vcc: This pin provides +5/+12 Volts to the reader. 
2.  Data D0: Data D0 at this pin. 
3.  Data D1: Data D1 at this pin. 
4.  Wiegand  red:  Switches  on  the  red  LED  on  the 

wiegand reader indicating access is denied. 

5.  Wiegand  green:  Switches  on  the  green  LED  on  the 

wiegand reader indicating access is granted. 

6.  Wiegand buzzer: The buzzer is switched on for finite 
time  duration  each  time  the  access  is  denied  or 
granted. 

7.  Wiegand  tamper:  If  the  wiegand  reader  is  tampered, 
the reader gives a high signal as output on the tamper 
pin. This pin is then connected to the micro-controller 
which controls the further action to be taken.  

8.  Wiegand ground: It provides ground or 0 Volts to the 

wiegand reader.  

 
The Wiegand interface uses three wires, one of which is a 
common  ground  and  two  of  which  are  data  transmission 
wires  usually  called  DATA0  and  DATA1,  alternately 
labeled  "D0"  and  "D1"  or  "Data  Low"  and  "Data  High". 
When  no  data  is  being  sent,  both  DATA0  and  DATA1 
are pulled  up to  the  "high"  voltage  level  —  usually 
+5 VDC. When a 0 is sent the DATA0 wire is pulled to a 
low voltage while the DATA1 wire stays at a high voltage. 
When  a  1  is  sent  the  DATA1  wire  is  pulled  to  a  low 
voltage while DATA0 stays at a high voltage. 
 
 2.2 Biometric Sensor 
 
The biometric scanner used is a fingerprint scanner. The A 
fingerprint scanner system has two basic jobs -- it needs to 
get  an  image  of  your  finger,  and  it  needs  to  determine 
whether  the  pattern  of  ridges  and  valleys  in  this  image 
matches  the  pattern  of  ridges  and  valleys  in  pre-scanned 
images. Only specific characteristics,  which are unique to 
every  fingerprint,  are  filtered  and  saved  as  an  encrypted

Fig 5 Fingerprint Scanner - 5V TTL (GT-511C1R) 

 

The fingerprint scanner shown in the figure above is from 
ADH-TECH  and  it  communicates  at  TTL  levels  serially. 
The  module  itself  does  all  of  the  heavy  lifting  behind 
reading  and  identifying  the  fingerprints  with  an  on-board 
optical sensor and 32-bit CPU. The module can only store 
up  to  20  different  fingerprints  but  is  capable  of  360° 
fingerprint 
recognition  and  download  and  upload 
templates  using  serial  interface.  The  module  is  small  and 
easy to mount using two mounting tabs on the side of the 
sensor.  The  on-board  JST-SH  connector  has  four  signals: 
Vcc, GND, Tx, Rx.

Fig. 9 Working of relay driven door lock prototype 
 
Figure  9  represents  the  implementation  of  relay  driven 
door lock using AT89C51 microcontroller.  
The  basic  operation  of  relay  driven  electromagnetic  door  
locks is as follows: 
1.  The microcontroller sends a trigger to a transistor. 
2.  The  transistor  is  turned  on  and  current  flows  through 

the coils of the relay. 

3.  When the current flows through the coils of the relay, 
the common terminal gets connected to normally open 
contact and hence the door is unlocked as it does not 
get the required power supply. 

4.  This  delay  of 

locking  can  be  controlled  by 

programming the mictrcontroller accordingly. 

 
3. Limitations 
 
In  case  of  an  emergency  situation,  we  may  require  the 
fingerprints  of  the  required  persons  in  order  to  open  the 
door.  Until  the  fingerprints  of  that  person  are  matched 

with the ones in the database, the door will not open. Also, 
failure in the WiFi connectivity due to any of the reasons, 
would  make  it  difficult  to  open  the  door.  Access  of  the 
RFID  tag  to  a  wrong  person  due  to  loss  or  robbery  can 
lead to a theft or a miscreant activity. 
 
In  case  of  a  large  number  of  users,  external  Flash 
memory  will  have  to  be  used  as  256KB  on  chip  flash 
would not suffice the needs. 
 
4. Extensions to the Main Project 
 
Given  the  advantages  of  any  wireless  network,  a  wireless 
access control system can be enhanced by adding a lot of 
additional features. Some of them are listed below: 
1.  Machine  learning  can  be  implemented  and  make  the 
system smarter. It can be used to analyse timings and give 
access in the future. Apart from this, the data collected can 
be used to monitor the efficiency of workers. 
2.  A  camera  can  be  implemented  connecting  it  wirelessly 
to  the  WiFi  module,  adding  a  second  layer  of  security.  A 
photograph can be clicked and sent on the server via WiFi 
every time the sensor comes across new data (entrant). 
3.  Wireless  access  control  can  be  used  in  college 
classrooms  to  take  attendance  and  also  keep  parents 
updated about pupils' attendance records. WiFi will help in 
transmitting attendance records on the server. 

 

Conclusion and Future Scope 
 
Recapitulating,  the  smart  access  control  system  is  an 
efficient  way  in  which  existing  problems  faced  by  the 
industry  can  be  overcome.  Also,  by  proper  selection  of 
microcontrollers used, energy efficiency can be obtained. 
In  the  recent  years,  products  based  on  IoT(Internet  of 
Things),like  Google  Glass,  have  been  in  the  forefront  of 
technological  innovations  and  hence  we  can  definitely 
hope that the best is yet to come. We can only imagine the 
manner  in  which  the  products  based  on  the  internet  of 
things  will  revolutionize  the  world.  The  day  is  imminent 
when  devices  will  be  smarter  and  smart  systems  will  be 
ubiquitous.
