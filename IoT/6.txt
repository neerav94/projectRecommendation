Abstract 

Management  of  chronic  diseases  is  important  to  self-management  for  health.    The  IoT 
concept  plays  a  significant  role  in  self-management  for  health.  In  order  to  accomplish  it, 
personal  health  devices  need  two  functions  such  as  application  network  protocol  and 
intelligent service. But, most of them have only simple function such as  indicating measured 
data and storing data temporarily.  In this research, we proposed an intelligent service model 
for  healthcare  which  gives  an  effective  feedback  to  an  individual.  In  order  to  do  this,  we 
introduced  the  collaboration  protocol  which  transfers  risk  factors  between  IoT  personal 
health devices. In addition to this, we proposed intellectualized service application algorithm 
which  will  be  operated  in  the  personal  health  device.  Finally,  based  on  the  findings  of  the 
experiment, the effectiveness was confirmed on proposed model.

1. Introduction 

Ubiquitous  health  (UH)  service  was  a  model  in  which  individual  medical  data  was 
measured  by  a  ubiquitous  personal  health  device  (UHD),  and  then  sent  to  the  health 
server  to  provide  feedback  to  medical  experts  and  patients  [1].  Thus,  most  researches 
were focused on the function of sending the measured biomedical data to the  server [1, 
2,  3].  Due  to  this  reason,  the  analysis  and  processing  function  of  medical  data  were 
mostly conducted in the server. 

As the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) was recently introduced, researches which 
attempt to apply the IOT model in different fields are being  progressed [4, 5, 6]. If IoT 
technique  is  applied  to  UH,  then  UHD  will  break  away  from  the  simple  functions  of 
indicating  measured  data  and  sending  them  to  the  server  and  execute  autonomous 
information  exchange  with  neighboring  systems  (UHDs,  gateway,  ser ver)  and  provide 
comprehensively  assessed  feedback  immediately  to  the  patient  [4].  For  instance,  a 
blood  pressure  which  is  above  140mmHg  is  generally  assessed  as  hypertension  [7].  If 
the  blood  pressure  measured  from  a  patient  with  symptoms  of  diabetes  mellitus  is 
135mmHg,  then  an  intellectualized  feedback  service  which  assesses  the  condition  as 
stage  1  hypertension  instead  of  prehypertension  can  be  provided  [7].  This  can  be 
provided  only  when  the  mutual  relationship  between  risk  factors  of  the  disease  is 
identified. 

In  this  research,  we  propose  an  intelligent  healthcare  service  model  that  can  enable 
personal  health  device  to  recognize  the  relationship  between  mutual  diseases  and  risk 
factors  and  provide  intellectualized  feedback  to  the  patient.  In  addition,  suggestion  is

1. Introduction 

Ubiquitous  health  (UH)  service  was  a  model  in  which  individual  medical  data  was 
measured  by  a  ubiquitous  personal  health  device  (UHD),  and  then  sent  to  the  health 
server  to  provide  feedback  to  medical  experts  and  patients  [1].  Thus,  most  researches 
were focused on the function of sending the measured biomedical data to the  server [1, 
2,  3].  Due  to  this  reason,  the  analysis  and  processing  function  of  medical  data  were 
mostly conducted in the server. 

As the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) was recently introduced, researches which 
attempt to apply the IOT model in different fields are being  progressed [4, 5, 6]. If IoT 
technique  is  applied  to  UH,  then  UHD  will  break  away  from  the  simple  functions  of 
indicating  measured  data  and  sending  them  to  the  server  and  execute  autonomous 
information  exchange  with  neighboring  systems  (UHDs,  gateway,  ser ver)  and  provide

the  blood  pressure  measured  from  a  patient  with  symptoms  of  diabetes  mellitus  is

provided  only  when  the  mutual  relationship  between  risk  factors  of  the  disease  is 
identified. 

In  this  research,  we  propose  an  intelligent  healthcare  service  model  that  can  enable 
personal  health  device  to  recognize  the  relationship  between  mutual  diseases  and  risk 
factors  and  provide  intellectualized  feedback  to  the  patient.  In  addition,  suggestion  is

modeling  procedure  and  collaboration  application  protocol  between  personal  health 
devices.  Furthermore,  it  is  presented  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  model  through 
experiments 

In  related  researches  presented  in  Chapter  2,  the  characteristics  and  diagnostic 
criteria  of  metabolic  syndrome,  a  major  risk  factor  of  chronic  diseases,  are  explored. 
Moreover, structural characteristics will be observed to identify the degree of suitability 
of  conceptual  model  of  IOT  on  U-Health.  In  Chapter  3,  suggestion  will  be  made  to 
intellectualized  collaboration  protocol  that  can  be  operated  in  IOT  based  UHD.  In 
Chapter  4,  virtual  data  is  utilized  to  conduct  experiment  and  experiment  results  are 
analyzed. Lastly, the conclusion will be presented in Chapter 5.  
 
2. Related Researches 

The  metabolic  syndrome  refers  to  the  condition  where  more  than  3  amongst  the  5 
factors (glucose, blood  pressure, obesity,  triglycerides, and HDL  cholesterol) are  above 
standard  values  [4,  7].  A  metabolic  syndrome  can  cause  various  complications  such  as 
cardiovascular  disease  and  brain  stroke  [8].  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  manage  these 
risk  factors  during  daily  life.  However,  since  the  3  risk  factors  hold  close  mut ual 
relationship, it is necessary to  give complex consideration  to  various risk factors  when 
setting  the  diagnostic  criteria.  Additionally,  in  order  to  look  into  whether  processing 
about  the  complex  diagnostic  criteria  can  be  applied  to  the  IOT  machine,  structural 
characteristics of IOT will be explored. 
 
2.1. Risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome 

Generally,  states  of  diseases  are  assessed  according  to  the  degree  of  error  of  the 
measurement  value  in  comparison  to  the  normal  range  [4].  When  blood  pressure  is 
taken as  an example, it is assessed as  stage 1  hypertension  when the  measured systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) is over 140mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is over 
than  90mmHg  [4,  7].  However,  in  case  of  patients  diagnosed  with  diabetes  mellitus  or 
chronic  kidney  disease,  it  should  be  assessed  as  stage  1  hypertension  when  they  are 
over  130mmHg  or  80mmHg,  so  that  accurate  assessment  takes  places  when  the  fixed 
range is readjusted [4, 7]. 

This  displays  how  conducting  comprehensive  assessment  on  various  risk  factors 
instead of only the measured values during the stage of diagnosing the degree of disease 
will  provide  accurate  information  to  the  patient.  Due  to  these  reasons,  the  assessment 
procedure  for  hypertension  gives  comprehensive  consideration 
to  SBP,  DBP, 
prevalence  rate  following  the  age  and  gender,  the  current  state  of  personal  disease 
(diagnostic results for obesity and diabetes mellitus), and family history as Figure 1 [7]. 
But most medical sensor devices do not give comprehensive assessmen t. 

Even in case of type 2 diabetes which consists for more than 90% of diabetes disease, 
consideration  is  made  for  glucose  measurement  value  along  with  risk  factors  such  as 
obesity, drinking, age, gender, personal disease, and family  history [9, 10]. Table 1 is a 
display  of  each  evaluative  result  which  is  in  accordance  to  the  range  of  measurement 
values  for  blood  pressure,  glucose,  BMI(Body  Mass  Index),  and  waise  circumference. 
In terms of the assessment scale for obesity, BMI and waist circumference are applied. 
As a result, obesity was classifed as a risk factor which caused influence in diabetes and 
blood pressure [10, 11].

As a result, obesity was classifed as a risk factor which caused influence in diabetes and

2.2. Structural Characteristic of IoT 

IOT is a conceptual model which provides service for human beings through things, which 
possess  innate  roles,  maintain  mutually  autonomous  collaboration  system  centered  on  the 
network  and  minimize  human  intervention  [4,  5].  IOT  can  be  applied  to  different  types  of 
services,  and  common  application  service  elements  such  as  network  access  management, 
power  management,  identification  management,  and security  management  must  be  acquired 
[4,  12].  Moreover,  there  are  also  specific  application  service  elements  of  the  thing.  For 
instance,  in  case  of  IOT  sensor  thing,  sensor  management  and  intelligent  application  of 
sending  or  handling  measurement  data  are  specific  application  service  elements.  Therefore, 
Figure  2  is  a  representation  of  classification  between  common  application  service  elements 
and specific application the service elements.  

WSN  (Wireless  Sensor  Network)  and  M2M  (Machine-to-Machine  Communication) 
can  be  considered  as  other  examples  of  IOT.  In  case  of  WSN,  data  me asured  from  the 
sensor  is  sent  to  the  server  or  the  information  provided  by  the  server  hold  one-sided 
directivity  as  it  is  sent  to  the  actuator.  On  the  other  hand,  M2M  holds  bilate ralness  as 
processing  is  executed  through  autonomous  communication  between  each  device  [5].

than  90mmHg  [4,  7].  However,  in  case  of  patients  diagnosed  with  diabetes  mellitus  or 
chronic  kidney  disease,  it  should  be  assessed  as  stage  1  hypertension  when  they  are 
over  130mmHg  or  80mmHg,  so  that  accurate  assessment  takes  places  when  the  fixed 
range is readjusted [4, 7]. 

This  displays  how  conducting  comprehensive  assessment  on  various  risk  factors 
instead of only the measured values during the stage of diagnosing the degree of disease 
will  provide  accurate  information  to  the  patient.  Due  to  these  reasons,  the  assessment 
procedure  for  hypertension  gives  comprehensive  consideration 
to  SBP,  DBP, 
prevalence  rate  following  the  age  and  gender,  the  current  state  of  personal  disease 
(diagnostic results for obesity and diabetes mellitus), and family history as Figure 1 [7]. 
But most medical sensor devices do not give comprehensive assessmen t. 

Even in case of type 2 diabetes which consists for more than 90% of diabetes disease, 
consideration  is  made  for  glucose  measurement  value  along  with  risk  factors  such  as 
obesity, drinking, age, gender, personal disease, and family  history [9, 10]. Table 1 is a 
display  of  each  evaluative  result  which  is  in  accordance  to  the  range  of  measurement 
values  for  blood  pressure,  glucose,  BMI(Body  Mass  Index),  and  waise  circumference. 
In terms of the assessment scale for obesity, BMI and waist circumference are applied. 
As a result, obesity was classifed as a risk factor which caused influence in diabetes and 
blood pressure [10, 11].

2.2. Structural Characteristic of IoT 

IOT is a conceptual model which provides service for human beings through things, which 
possess  innate  roles,  maintain  mutually  autonomous  collaboration  system  centered  on  the 
network  and  minimize  human  intervention  [4,  5].  IOT  can  be  applied  to  different  types  of 
services,  and  common  application  service  elements  such  as  network  access  management, 
power  management,  identification  management,  and security  management  must  be  acquired 
[4,  12].  Moreover,  there  are  also  specific  application  service  elements  of  the  thing.  For 
instance,  in  case  of  IOT  sensor  thing,  sensor  management  and  intelligent  application  of 
sending  or  handling  measurement  data  are  specific  application  service  elements.  Therefore, 
Figure  2  is  a  representation  of  classification  between  common  application  service  elements 
and specific application the service elements.  

WSN  (Wireless  Sensor  Network)  and  M2M  (Machine-to-Machine  Communication) 
can  be  considered  as  other  examples  of  IOT.  In  case  of  WSN,  data  me asured  from  the 
sensor  is  sent  to  the  server  or  the  information  provided  by  the  server  hold  one-sided 
directivity  as  it  is  sent  to  the  actuator.  On  the  other  hand,  M2M  holds  bilate ralness  as 
processing  is  executed  through  autonomous  communication  between  each  device  [5].

Therefore, the current u-Health model where data measured from the medical sensor is 
sent to the u-Health server can be considered approximate to WSN [ 5].

However, the service elements of device and network have recently  become superior 
and  user  demands  became  diversified  and  these  conditions  brought  the  need  of  more 
intellectualized  and  distributed  processing  [4].  This  is  suggesting  a  new  direction  for 
the  u-Health  service  to  change  from  the  current  WSN  type  to  the  M2m  type  in  the 
future. Within this context, this study will suggest a new smart healthcare service model

The  Smart  healthcare  service  model  is  a  collaboration  model  which  acquires  risk 
factors needed for assessment from the network and reflects on them by real -time. Two 
types of factors are needed for this service. They are the collaboration protocol nee ded 
to  acquire

intellectualized assessment. Figure 3 defined the IOT based service model regarding the 
risk  factors  of  3  major  metabolic  syndromes.  First  of  all,  IOTXX  is  represented  as  a 
device which enables connection to the IOT network and autonomous collaboration and 
the  functions  of  each  device  was  indicted  as  xx.  In  Figure  3,  (a)  is  a  sp ecific 
representation  of  this.  In  terms  of  the  blood  pressure  monitor  (IOTBP),  only  the 
measured  blood  pressure  is  not  displayed.  Instead,  data  on  diabetes  measured  by  the 
glucose  meter  (IOTGL)  and  the  data  on  obesity  measured  by  the  weight  scale  (IOTOB) 
are  requested  to  acquire  the  result  [4].  If  data  cannot  be  immediately  sent  by  other 
IOTs, information stored by gateway (IOTGW) is requested for and attained. In addition 
to  this,  risk  factors  of  the  patient  such  as  the  gender,  age,  and  family  history  are 
received  by  the  u-Health  server  (IOTSVR).  However,  even  when  the  IOT  device  is  not 
within  the  network  reception  range  or  is  turned  off  just  as  it  is  shown  in  (b)  or  (c), 
information sent from IOTGW or IOTSVR are applied to assess the measurement value

Abstract 

Management  of  chronic  diseases  is  important  to  self-management  for  health.    The  IoT 
concept  plays  a  significant  role  in  self-management  for  health.  In  order  to  accomplish  it, 
personal  health  devices  need  two  functions  such  as  application  network  protocol  and 
intelligent service. But, most of them have only simple function such as  indicating measured 
data and storing data temporarily.  In this research, we proposed an intelligent service model 
for  healthcare  which  gives  an  effective  feedback  to  an  individual.  In  order  to  do  this,  we 
introduced  the  collaboration  protocol  which  transfers  risk  factors  between  IoT  personal 
health devices. In addition to this, we proposed intellectualized service application algorithm 
which  will  be  operated  in  the  personal  health  device.  Finally,  based  on  the  findings  of  the 
experiment, the effectiveness was confirmed on proposed model.

1. Introduction 

Ubiquitous  health  (UH)  service  was  a  model  in  which  individual  medical  data  was 
measured  by  a  ubiquitous  personal  health  device  (UHD),  and  then  sent  to  the  health 
server  to  provide  feedback  to  medical  experts  and  patients  [1].  Thus,  most  researches 
were focused on the function of sending the measured biomedical data to the  server [1, 
2,  3].  Due  to  this  reason,  the  analysis  and  processing  function  of  medical  data  were 
mostly conducted in the server. 

As the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) was recently introduced, researches which 
attempt to apply the IOT model in different fields are being  progressed [4, 5, 6]. If IoT 
technique  is  applied  to  UH,  then  UHD  will  break  away  from  the  simple  functions  of 
indicating  measured  data  and  sending  them  to  the  server  and  execute  autonomous 
information  exchange  with  neighboring  systems  (UHDs,  gateway,  ser ver)  and  provide 
comprehensively  assessed  feedback  immediately  to  the  patient  [4].  For  instance,  a 
blood  pressure  which  is  above  140mmHg  is  generally  assessed  as  hypertension  [7].  If 
the  blood  pressure  measured  from  a  patient  with  symptoms  of  diabetes  mellitus  is 
135mmHg,  then  an  intellectualized  feedback  service  which  assesses  the  condition  as 
stage  1  hypertension  instead  of  prehypertension  can  be  provided  [7].  This  can  be 
provided  only  when  the  mutual  relationship  between  risk  factors  of  the  disease  is 
identified. 

In  this  research,  we  propose  an  intelligent  healthcare  service  model  that  can  enable 
personal  health  device  to  recognize  the  relationship  between  mutual  diseases  and  risk 
factors  and  provide  intellectualized  feedback  to  the  patient.  In  addition,  suggestion  is

made  for  the  assessment  algorithm  of  intellectualized  processing  essential  during  the 
modeling  procedure  and  collaboration  application  protocol  between  personal  health 
devices.  Furthermore,  it  is  presented  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  model  through 
experiments 

In  related  researches  presented  in  Chapter  2,  the  characteristics  and  diagnostic 
criteria  of  metabolic  syndrome,  a  major  risk  factor  of  chronic  diseases,  are  explored. 
Moreover, structural characteristics will be observed to identify the degree of suitability 
of  conceptual  model  of  IOT  on  U-Health.  In  Chapter  3,  suggestion  will  be  made  to 
intellectualized  collaboration  protocol  that  can  be  operated  in  IOT  based  UHD.  In 
Chapter  4,  virtual  data  is  utilized  to  conduct  experiment  and  experiment  results  are 
analyzed. Lastly, the conclusion will be presented in Chapter 5.  
 
2. Related Researches 

The  metabolic  syndrome  refers  to  the  condition  where  more  than  3  amongst  the  5 
factors (glucose, blood  pressure, obesity,  triglycerides, and HDL  cholesterol) are  above 
standard  values  [4,  7].  A  metabolic  syndrome  can  cause  various  complications  such  as 
cardiovascular  disease  and  brain  stroke  [8].  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  manage  these 
risk  factors  during  daily  life.  However,  since  the  3  risk  factors  hold  close  mut ual 
relationship, it is necessary to  give complex consideration  to  various risk factors  when 
setting  the  diagnostic  criteria.  Additionally,  in  order  to  look  into  whether  processing 
about  the  complex  diagnostic  criteria  can  be  applied  to  the  IOT  machine,  structural 
characteristics of IOT will be explored. 
 
2.1. Risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome 

Generally,  states  of  diseases  are  assessed  according  to  the  degree  of  error  of  the 
measurement  value  in  comparison  to  the  normal  range  [4].  When  blood  pressure  is 
taken as  an example, it is assessed as  stage 1  hypertension  when the  measured systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) is over 140mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is over 
than  90mmHg  [4,  7].  However,  in  case  of  patients  diagnosed  with  diabetes  mellitus  or 
chronic  kidney  disease,  it  should  be  assessed  as  stage  1  hypertension  when  they  are 
over  130mmHg  or  80mmHg,  so  that  accurate  assessment  takes  places  when  the  fixed 
range is readjusted [4, 7]. 

This  displays  how  conducting  comprehensive  assessment  on  various  risk  factors 
instead of only the measured values during the stage of diagnosing the degree of disease 
will  provide  accurate  information  to  the  patient.  Due  to  these  reasons,  the  assessment 
procedure  for  hypertension  gives  comprehensive  consideration 
to  SBP,  DBP, 
prevalence  rate  following  the  age  and  gender,  the  current  state  of  personal  disease 
(diagnostic results for obesity and diabetes mellitus), and family history as Figure 1 [7]. 
But most medical sensor devices do not give comprehensive assessmen t. 

Even in case of type 2 diabetes which consists for more than 90% of diabetes disease, 
consideration  is  made  for  glucose  measurement  value  along  with  risk  factors  such  as 
obesity, drinking, age, gender, personal disease, and family  history [9, 10]. Table 1 is a 
display  of  each  evaluative  result  which  is  in  accordance  to  the  range  of  measurement 
values  for  blood  pressure,  glucose,  BMI(Body  Mass  Index),  and  waise  circumference. 
In terms of the assessment scale for obesity, BMI and waist circumference are applied. 
As a result, obesity was classifed as a risk factor which caused influence in diabetes and 
blood pressure [10, 11].

instance,  in  case  of  IOT  sensor  thing,  sensor  management  and  intelligent  application  of 
sending  or  handling  measurement  data  are  specific  application  service  elements.  Therefore, 
Figure  2  is  a  representation  of  classification  between  common  application  service  elements 
and specific application the service elements.

IOTXX  must  collect  essential  information  by  real-time  to  effectively  construct  a 
collaboration  model.  In  order  to  do  so,  seamless  collaboration  protocol  is  needed 
between each IOTXX device. We propose the collaboration protocol at the next clause. 
 
3.2. Collaboration protocol between IoT personal health devices 

The  collaboration  protocol  is  an  application  protocol  which  sends  and  receives  risk 
factor  information  needed  between  IOT  devices  [4].  Since  u-Health  devices  used  in 
home connect to the home networks like Bluetooth or Zigbee, the protocol suggested in 
this paper is an application protocol over the WSN. In Figure 4, (a) displays an example 
of a protocol process in the case of (b) of  Figure 3. Once IOTBP operates, Join message 
is broadcasted and make known to all devices in the network.  During this tim e, IOTOB 
and  IOTGW  receive  the  Join  message,  but  IOTGL  is  not  able  to  receive  it.  IOTBP 
measures the blood pressure and sends the Data.Req message so that risk factors needed 
for assessment are gathered. 

IOTOB and IOTGW, which receive Data.Req message, send the Data.Ack message and 
the  risk  factor  information  of  relevant  patients  stored  by  each  device.    If  risk  factors 
about patients are not  available,  Data.Nak  is  sent to notify that there is  no  information 
available.  In  order  to  receive  the  newest  information,  Data.Req  is  sent  each  time  the 
blood  pressure  was  measured  so  that  the  latest  information  is  r eflected  on  the 
assessment. It was structured so that the Leave message is sent to make known that the 
network  was  left  from  when  the  power  of  the  IOT BP  became  switched  off  or 
measurement  was  terminated.  It  was  designed  so  that  the  overall  pr ocedures  can  take 
place seamlessly and user convenience was optimized

1. Introduction 

Ubiquitous  health  (UH)  service  was  a  model  in  which  individual  medical  data  was 
measured  by  a  ubiquitous  personal  health  device  (UHD),  and  then  sent  to  the  health 
server  to  provide  feedback  to  medical  experts  and  patients  [1].  Thus,  most  researches 
were focused on the function of sending the measured biomedical data to the  server [1, 
2,  3].  Due  to  this  reason,  the  analysis  and  processing  function  of  medical  data  were 
mostly conducted in the server. 

As the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) was recently introduced, researches which 
attempt to apply the IOT model in different fields are being  progressed [4, 5, 6]. If IoT 
technique  is  applied  to  UH,  then  UHD  will  break  away  from  the  simple  functions  of 
indicating  measured  data  and  sending  them  to  the  server  and  execute  autonomous 
information  exchange  with  neighboring  systems  (UHDs,  gateway,  ser ver)  and  provide 
comprehensively  assessed  feedback  immediately  to  the  patient  [4].  For  instance,  a 
blood  pressure  which  is  above  140mmHg  is  generally  assessed  as  hypertension  [7].  If 
the  blood  pressure  measured  from  a  patient  with  symptoms  of  diabetes  mellitus  is 
135mmHg,  then  an  intellectualized  feedback  service  which  assesses  the  condition  as 
stage  1  hypertension  instead  of  prehypertension  can  be  provided  [7].  This  can  be 
provided  only  when  the  mutual  relationship  between  risk  factors  of  the  disease  is 
identified. 

In  this  research,  we  propose  an  intelligent  healthcare  service  model  that  can  enable 
personal  health  device  to  recognize  the  relationship  between  mutual  diseases  and  risk 
factors  and  provide  intellectualized  feedback  to  the  patient.  In  addition,  suggestion  is

cardiovascular  disease  and  brain  stroke  [8].  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  manage  these 
risk  factors  during  daily  life.  However,  since  the  3  risk  factors  hold  close  mut ual 
relationship, it is necessary to  give complex consideration  to  various risk factors  when 
setting  the  diagnostic  criteria.  Additionally,  in  order  to  look  into  whether  processing 
about  the  complex  diagnostic  criteria  can  be  applied  to  the  IOT  machine,  structural 
characteristics of IOT will be explored. 
 
2.1. Risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome 

Generally,  states  of  diseases  are  assessed  according  to  the  degree  of  error  of  the 
measurement  value  in  comparison  to  the  normal  range  [4].  When  blood  pressure  is 
taken as  an example, it is assessed as  stage 1  hypertension  when the  measured systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) is over 140mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is over 
than  90mmHg  [4,  7].  However,  in  case  of  patients  diagnosed  with  diabetes  mellitus  or 
chronic  kidney  disease,  it  should  be  assessed  as  stage  1  hypertension  when  they  are 
over  130mmHg  or  80mmHg,  so  that  accurate  assessment  takes  places  when  the  fixed 
range is readjusted [4, 7]. 

This  displays  how  conducting  comprehensive  assessment  on  various  risk  factors 
instead of only the measured values during the stage of diagnosing the degree of disease 
will  provide  accurate  information  to  the  patient.  Due  to  these  reasons,  the  assessment 
procedure  for  hypertension  gives  comprehensive  consideration 
to  SBP,  DBP, 
prevalence  rate  following  the  age  and  gender,  the  current  state  of  personal  disease 
(diagnostic results for obesity and diabetes mellitus), and family history as Figure 1 [7]. 
But most medical sensor devices do not give comprehensive assessmen t. 

Even in case of type 2 diabetes which consists for more than 90% of diabetes disease, 
consideration  is  made  for  glucose  measurement  value  along  with  risk  factors  such  as 
obesity, drinking, age, gender, personal disease, and family  history [9, 10]. Table 1 is a 
display  of  each  evaluative  result  which  is  in  accordance  to  the  range  of  measurement 
values  for  blood  pressure,  glucose,  BMI(Body  Mass  Index),  and  waise  circumference. 
In terms of the assessment scale for obesity, BMI and waist circumference are applied. 
As a result, obesity was classifed as a risk factor which caused influence in diabetes and 
blood pressure [10, 11].

2.2. Structural Characteristic of IoT 

IOT is a conceptual model which provides service for human beings through things, which 
possess  innate  roles,  maintain  mutually  autonomous  collaboration  system  centered  on  the 
network  and  minimize  human  intervention  [4,  5].  IOT  can  be  applied  to  different  types  of 
services,  and  common  application  service  elements  such  as  network  access  management, 
power  management,  identification  management,  and security  management  must  be  acquired 
[4,  12].  Moreover,  there  are  also  specific  application  service  elements  of  the  thing.  For 
instance,  in  case  of  IOT  sensor  thing,  sensor  management  and  intelligent  application  of 
sending  or  handling  measurement  data  are  specific  application  service  elements.  Therefore, 
Figure  2  is  a  representation  of  classification  between  common  application  service  elements 
and specific application the service elements.  

WSN  (Wireless  Sensor  Network)  and  M2M  (Machine-to-Machine  Communication) 
can  be  considered  as  other  examples  of  IOT.  In  case  of  WSN,  data  me asured  from  the 
sensor  is  sent  to  the  server  or  the  information  provided  by  the  server  hold  one-sided 
directivity  as  it  is  sent  to  the  actuator.  On  the  other  hand,  M2M  holds  bilate ralness  as 
processing  is  executed  through  autonomous  communication  between  each  device  [5].

Therefore, the current u-Health model where data measured from the medical sensor is 
sent to the u-Health server can be considered approximate to WSN [ 5].

However, the service elements of device and network have recently  become superior 
and  user  demands  became  diversified  and  these  conditions  brought  the  need  of  more 
intellectualized  and  distributed  processing  [4].  This  is  suggesting  a  new  direction  for 
the  u-Health  service  to  change  from  the  current  WSN  type  to  the  M2m  type  in  the 
future. Within this context, this study will suggest a new smart healthcare service model 
based on IOT

for 

factors  and 

intelligent  application  needed 

The  Smart  healthcare  service  model  is  a  collaboration  model  which  acquires  risk 
factors needed for assessment from the network and reflects on them by real -time. Two 
types of factors are needed for this service. They are the collaboration protocol nee ded 
to  acquire 
reflected 
intellectualized assessment. Figure 3 defined the IOT based service model regarding the 
risk  factors  of  3  major  metabolic  syndromes.  First  of  all,  IOTXX  is  represented  as  a 
device which enables connection to the IOT network and autonomous collaboration and 
the  functions  of  each  device  was  indicted  as  xx.  In  Figure  3,  (a)  is  a  sp ecific 
representation  of  this.  In  terms  of  the  blood  pressure  monitor  (IOTBP),  only  the 
measured  blood  pressure  is  not  displayed.  Instead,  data  on  diabetes  measured  by  the 
glucose  meter  (IOTGL)  and  the  data  on  obesity  measured  by  the  weight  scale  (IOTOB) 
are  requested  to  acquire  the  result  [4].  If  data  cannot  be  immediately  sent  by  other 
IOTs, information stored by gateway (IOTGW) is requested for and attained. In addition 
to  this,  risk  factors  of  the  patient  such  as  the  gender,  age,  and  family  history  are 
received  by  the  u-Health  server  (IOTSVR).  However,  even  when  the  IOT  device  is  not 
within  the  network  reception  range  or  is  turned  off  just  as  it  is  shown  in  (b)  or  (c), 
information sent from IOTGW or IOTSVR are applied to assess the measurement value

IOTXX  must  collect  essential  information  by  real-time  to  effectively  construct  a 
collaboration  model.  In  order  to  do  so,  seamless  collaboration  protocol  is  needed 
between each IOTXX device. We propose the collaboration protocol at the next clause. 
 
3.2. Collaboration protocol between IoT personal health devices 

The  collaboration  protocol  is  an  application  protocol  which  sends  and  receives  risk 
factor  information  needed  between  IOT  devices  [4].  Since  u-Health  devices  used  in 
home connect to the home networks like Bluetooth or Zigbee, the protocol suggested in 
this paper is an application protocol over the WSN. In Figure 4, (a) displays an example 
of a protocol process in the case of (b) of  Figure 3. Once IOTBP operates, Join message 
is broadcasted and make known to all devices in the network.  During this tim e, IOTOB 
and  IOTGW  receive  the  Join  message,  but  IOTGL  is  not  able  to  receive  it.  IOTBP 
measures the blood pressure and sends the Data.Req message so that risk factors needed 
for assessment are gathered. 

IOTOB and IOTGW, which receive Data.Req message, send the Data.Ack message and 
the  risk  factor  information  of  relevant  patients  stored  by  each  device.    If  risk  factors 
about patients are not  available,  Data.Nak  is  sent to notify that there is  no  information 
available.  In  order  to  receive  the  newest  information,  Data.Req  is  sent  each  time  the 
blood  pressure  was  measured  so  that  the  latest  information  is  r eflected  on  the 
assessment. It was structured so that the Leave message is sent to make known that the 
network  was  left  from  when  the  power  of  the  IOT BP  became  switched  off  or 
measurement  was  terminated.  It  was  designed  so  that  the  overall  pr ocedures  can  take 
place seamlessly and user convenience was optimized

In  Figure  4,  (b)  represents  the  format  of  the  messages  used  during  the  transmission 
process  of  (a).  The  number  of  message  type  is  5  in  this  protocol.  ‘Join’  and  ‘Leave’ 
were  defined  without  ‘Payload’  in  order  to  minimize  the  transmission  overhead.  In 
medical  data  type  (M),  classification  was  made  between  blood  pressure,  glucose,  and 
obesity.  The  source  address  (S)  and  destination  address  (D)  of  the  IOT  device  were 
defined in the message. Additionally, the message includes the sequence number (N) of 
each  message,  length  of  payload.  And  also,  patient  identification  information  and  risk 
factors  were  defined  in  the  Payload.  Each  header  field  was  constructed  as  1  byte  and 
payload was defined as variable size. The information collec ted in form of this protocol 
is  applied  to  provide  comprehensive  consideration  to  the  relationship  between  mutual 
diseases  and  risk  factors.  In  the  next  clause,  definition  of  intelligent  application  which 
can manage this process will be explored 
 
3.3. Intellectualized service application 

Event-driven  model  is  appropriate  for  the  intelligent  application  operating  in  IOT 
since  it  has  to  take  measurements  by  the  sensor  while  collecting  data  by  the  use  of 
network.  Therefore,  as  it  is  displayed  in  Figure  5,  the  application  is  co nstructed  as  5 
major  events  and  their  event  handlers  for  processing.  The  first  event  is  a  boot  event 
which  occurs  when  the  power  is  turned  on  and  it  initializes  the  IOT  device  and 
the  measurement  event  which  occurs  when 
broadcasts 

the  Join  message.  In

Abstract 

Management  of  chronic  diseases  is  important  to  self-management  for  health.    The  IoT 
concept  plays  a  significant  role  in  self-management  for  health.  In  order  to  accomplish  it, 
personal  health  devices  need  two  functions  such  as  application  network  protocol  and 
intelligent service. But, most of them have only simple function such as  indicating measured 
data and storing data temporarily.  In this research, we proposed an intelligent service model 
for  healthcare  which  gives  an  effective  feedback  to  an  individual.  In  order  to  do  this,  we 
introduced  the  collaboration  protocol  which  transfers  risk  factors  between  IoT  personal 
health devices. In addition to this, we proposed intellectualized service application algorithm 
which  will  be  operated  in  the  personal  health  device.  Finally,  based  on  the  findings  of  the 
experiment, the effectiveness was confirmed on proposed model.

1. Introduction 

Ubiquitous  health  (UH)  service  was  a  model  in  which  individual  medical  data  was 
measured  by  a  ubiquitous  personal  health  device  (UHD),  and  then  sent  to  the  health 
server  to  provide  feedback  to  medical  experts  and  patients  [1].  Thus,  most  researches 
were focused on the function of sending the measured biomedical data to the  server [1, 
2,  3].  Due  to  this  reason,  the  analysis  and  processing  function  of  medical  data  were 
mostly conducted in the server. 

As the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) was recently introduced, researches which 
attempt to apply the IOT model in different fields are being  progressed [4, 5, 6]. If IoT 
technique  is  applied  to  UH,  then  UHD  will  break  away  from  the  simple  functions  of 
indicating  measured  data  and  sending  them  to  the  server  and  execute  autonomous 
information  exchange  with  neighboring  systems  (UHDs,  gateway,  ser ver)  and  provide 
comprehensively  assessed  feedback  immediately  to  the  patient  [4].  For  instance,  a 
blood  pressure  which  is  above  140mmHg  is  generally  assessed  as  hypertension  [7].  If 
the  blood  pressure  measured  from  a  patient  with  symptoms  of  diabetes  mellitus  is 
135mmHg,  then  an  intellectualized  feedback  service  which  assesses  the  condition  as 
stage  1  hypertension  instead  of  prehypertension  can  be  provided  [7].  This  can  be 
provided  only  when  the  mutual  relationship  between  risk  factors  of  the  disease  is 
identified. 

In  this  research,  we  propose  an  intelligent  healthcare  service  model  that  can  enable 
personal  health  device  to  recognize  the  relationship  between  mutual  diseases  and  risk 
factors  and  provide  intellectualized  feedback  to  the  patient.  In  addition,  suggestion  is

made  for  the  assessment  algorithm  of  intellectualized  processing  essential  during  the 
modeling  procedure  and  collaboration  application  protocol  between  personal  health 
devices.  Furthermore,  it  is  presented  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  model  through 
experiments 

In  related  researches  presented  in  Chapter  2,  the  characteristics  and  diagnostic 
criteria  of  metabolic  syndrome,  a  major  risk  factor  of  chronic  diseases,  are  explored. 
Moreover, structural characteristics will be observed to identify the degree of suitability 
of  conceptual  model  of  IOT  on  U-Health.  In  Chapter  3,  suggestion  will  be  made  to 
intellectualized  collaboration  protocol  that  can  be  operated  in  IOT  based  UHD.  In 
Chapter  4,  virtual  data  is  utilized  to  conduct  experiment  and  experiment  results  are 
analyzed. Lastly, the conclusion will be presented in Chapter 5.  
 
2. Related Researches 

The  metabolic  syndrome  refers  to  the  condition  where  more  than  3  amongst  the  5 
factors (glucose, blood  pressure, obesity,  triglycerides, and HDL  cholesterol) are  above 
standard  values  [4,  7].  A  metabolic  syndrome  can  cause  various  complications  such  as 
cardiovascular  disease  and  brain  stroke  [8].  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  manage  these 
risk  factors  during  daily  life.  However,  since  the  3  risk  factors  hold  close  mut ual 
relationship, it is necessary to  give complex consideration  to  various risk factors  when 
setting  the  diagnostic  criteria.  Additionally,  in  order  to  look  into  whether  processing 
about  the  complex  diagnostic  criteria  can  be  applied  to  the  IOT  machine,  structural 
characteristics of IOT will be explored. 
 
2.1. Risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome 

Generally,  states  of  diseases  are  assessed  according  to  the  degree  of  error  of  the 
measurement  value  in  comparison  to  the  normal  range  [4].  When  blood  pressure  is 
taken as  an example, it is assessed as  stage 1  hypertension  when the  measured systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) is over 140mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is over 
than  90mmHg  [4,  7].  However,  in  case  of  patients  diagnosed  with  diabetes  mellitus  or 
chronic  kidney  disease,  it  should  be  assessed  as  stage  1  hypertension  when  they  are 
over  130mmHg  or  80mmHg,  so  that  accurate  assessment  takes  places  when  the  fixed 
range is readjusted [4, 7]. 

This  displays  how  conducting  comprehensive  assessment  on  various  risk  factors 
instead of only the measured values during the stage of diagnosing the degree of disease 
will  provide  accurate  information  to  the  patient.  Due  to  these  reasons,  the  assessment 
procedure  for  hypertension  gives  comprehensive  consideration 
to  SBP,  DBP, 
prevalence  rate  following  the  age  and  gender,  the  current  state  of  personal  disease 
(diagnostic results for obesity and diabetes mellitus), and family history as Figure 1 [7]. 
But most medical sensor devices do not give comprehensive assessmen t. 

Even in case of type 2 diabetes which consists for more than 90% of diabetes disease, 
consideration  is  made  for  glucose  measurement  value  along  with  risk  factors  such  as 
obesity, drinking, age, gender, personal disease, and family  history [9, 10]. Table 1 is a 
display  of  each  evaluative  result  which  is  in  accordance  to  the  range  of  measurement 
values  for  blood  pressure,  glucose,  BMI(Body  Mass  Index),  and  waise  circumference. 
In terms of the assessment scale for obesity, BMI and waist circumference are applied. 
As a result, obesity was classifed as a risk factor which caused influence in diabetes and 
blood pressure [10, 11].

instance,  in  case  of  IOT  sensor  thing,  sensor  management  and  intelligent  application  of 
sending  or  handling  measurement  data  are  specific  application  service  elements.  Therefore, 
Figure  2  is  a  representation  of  classification  between  common  application  service  elements 
and specific application the service elements.  

WSN  (Wireless  Sensor  Network)  and  M2M  (Machine-to-Machine  Communication) 
can  be  considered  as  other  examples  of  IOT.  In  case  of  WSN,  data  me asured  from  the

Abstract 

Management  of  chronic  diseases  is  important  to  self-management  for  health.    The  IoT 
concept  plays  a  significant  role  in  self-management  for  health.  In  order  to  accomplish  it, 
personal  health  devices  need  two  functions  such  as  application  network  protocol  and 
intelligent service. But, most of them have only simple function such as  indicating measured 
data and storing data temporarily.  In this research, we proposed an intelligent service model 
for  healthcare  which  gives  an  effective  feedback  to  an  individual.  In  order  to  do  this,  we 
introduced  the  collaboration  protocol  which  transfers  risk  factors  between  IoT  personal 
health devices. In addition to this, we proposed intellectualized service application algorithm 
which  will  be  operated  in  the  personal  health  device.  Finally,  based  on  the  findings  of  the 
experiment, the effectiveness was confirmed on proposed model.

1. Introduction 

Ubiquitous  health  (UH)  service  was  a  model  in  which  individual  medical  data  was 
measured  by  a  ubiquitous  personal  health  device  (UHD),  and  then  sent  to  the  health 
server  to  provide  feedback  to  medical  experts  and  patients  [1].  Thus,  most  researches 
were focused on the function of sending the measured biomedical data to the  server [1, 
2,  3].  Due  to  this  reason,  the  analysis  and  processing  function  of  medical  data  were 
mostly conducted in the server. 

As the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) was recently introduced, researches which 
attempt to apply the IOT model in different fields are being  progressed [4, 5, 6]. If IoT 
technique  is  applied  to  UH,  then  UHD  will  break  away  from  the  simple  functions  of 
indicating  measured  data  and  sending  them  to  the  server  and  execute  autonomous 
information  exchange  with  neighboring  systems  (UHDs,  gateway,  ser ver)  and  provide 
comprehensively  assessed  feedback  immediately  to  the  patient  [4].  For  instance,  a 
blood  pressure  which  is  above  140mmHg  is  generally  assessed  as  hypertension  [7].  If 
the  blood  pressure  measured  from  a  patient  with  symptoms  of  diabetes  mellitus  is 
135mmHg,  then  an  intellectualized  feedback  service  which  assesses  the  condition  as 
stage  1  hypertension  instead  of  prehypertension  can  be  provided  [7].  This  can  be 
provided  only  when  the  mutual  relationship  between  risk  factors  of  the  disease  is 
identified. 

In  this  research,  we  propose  an  intelligent  healthcare  service  model  that  can  enable 
personal  health  device  to  recognize  the  relationship  between  mutual  diseases  and  risk 
factors  and  provide  intellectualized  feedback  to  the  patient.  In  addition,  suggestion  is

made  for  the  assessment  algorithm  of  intellectualized  processing  essential  during  the 
modeling  procedure  and  collaboration  application  protocol  between  personal  health 
devices.  Furthermore,  it  is  presented  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  model  through 
experiments 

In  related  researches  presented  in  Chapter  2,  the  characteristics  and  diagnostic 
criteria  of  metabolic  syndrome,  a  major  risk  factor  of  chronic  diseases,  are  explored. 
Moreover, structural characteristics will be observed to identify the degree of suitability 
of  conceptual  model  of  IOT  on  U-Health.  In  Chapter  3,  suggestion  will  be  made  to 
intellectualized  collaboration  protocol  that  can  be  operated  in  IOT  based  UHD.  In 
Chapter  4,  virtual  data  is  utilized  to  conduct  experiment  and  experiment  results  are 
analyzed. Lastly, the conclusion will be presented in Chapter 5.  
 
2. Related Researches 

The  metabolic  syndrome  refers  to  the  condition  where  more  than  3  amongst  the  5 
factors (glucose, blood  pressure, obesity,  triglycerides, and HDL  cholesterol) are  above 
standard  values  [4,  7].  A  metabolic  syndrome  can  cause  various  complications  such  as 
cardiovascular  disease  and  brain  stroke  [8].  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  manage  these 
risk  factors  during  daily  life.  However,  since  the  3  risk  factors  hold  close  mut ual 
relationship, it is necessary to  give complex consideration  to  various risk factors  when 
setting  the  diagnostic  criteria.  Additionally,  in  order  to  look  into  whether  processing 
about  the  complex  diagnostic  criteria  can  be  applied  to  the  IOT  machine,  structural 
characteristics of IOT will be explored. 
 
2.1. Risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome 

Generally,  states  of  diseases  are  assessed  according  to  the  degree  of  error  of  the 
measurement  value  in  comparison  to  the  normal  range  [4].  When  blood  pressure  is 
taken as  an example, it is assessed as  stage 1  hypertension  when the  measured systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) is over 140mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is over 
than  90mmHg  [4,  7].  However,  in  case  of  patients  diagnosed  with  diabetes  mellitus  or 
chronic  kidney  disease,  it  should  be  assessed  as  stage  1  hypertension  when  they  are 
over  130mmHg  or  80mmHg,  so  that  accurate  assessment  takes  places  when  the  fixed 
range is readjusted [4, 7]. 

This  displays  how  conducting  comprehensive  assessment  on  various  risk  factors 
instead of only the measured values during the stage of diagnosing the degree of disease 
will  provide  accurate  information  to  the  patient.  Due  to  these  reasons,  the  assessment 
procedure  for  hypertension  gives  comprehensive  consideration 
to  SBP,  DBP, 
prevalence  rate  following  the  age  and  gender,  the  current  state  of  personal  disease 
(diagnostic results for obesity and diabetes mellitus), and family history as Figure 1 [7]. 
But most medical sensor devices do not give comprehensive assessmen t. 

Even in case of type 2 diabetes which consists for more than 90% of diabetes disease, 
consideration  is  made  for  glucose  measurement  value  along  with  risk  factors  such  as 
obesity, drinking, age, gender, personal disease, and family  history [9, 10]. Table 1 is a 
display  of  each  evaluative  result  which  is  in  accordance  to  the  range  of  measurement 
values  for  blood  pressure,  glucose,  BMI(Body  Mass  Index),  and  waise  circumference. 
In terms of the assessment scale for obesity, BMI and waist circumference are applied. 
As a result, obesity was classifed as a risk factor which caused influence in diabetes and 
blood pressure [10, 11].

2.2. Structural Characteristic of IoT 

IOT is a conceptual model which provides service for human beings through things, which 
possess  innate  roles,  maintain  mutually  autonomous  collaboration  system  centered  on  the 
network  and  minimize  human  intervention  [4,  5].  IOT  can  be  applied  to  different  types  of 
services,  and  common  application  service  elements  such  as  network  access  management, 
power  management,  identification  management,  and security  management  must  be  acquired 
[4,  12].  Moreover,  there  are  also  specific  application  service  elements  of  the  thing.  For 
instance,  in  case  of  IOT  sensor  thing,  sensor  management  and  intelligent  application  of 
sending  or  handling  measurement  data  are  specific  application  service  elements.  Therefore, 
Figure  2  is  a  representation  of  classification  between  common  application  service  elements 
and specific application the service elements.  

WSN  (Wireless  Sensor  Network)  and  M2M  (Machine-to-Machine  Communication) 
can  be  considered  as  other  examples  of  IOT.  In  case  of  WSN,  data  me asured  from  the 
sensor  is  sent  to  the  server  or  the  information  provided  by  the  server  hold  one-sided 
directivity  as  it  is  sent  to  the  actuator.  On  the  other  hand,  M2M  holds  bilate ralness  as 
processing  is  executed  through  autonomous  communication  between  each  device  [5].

Therefore, the current u-Health model where data measured from the medical sensor is 
sent to the u-Health server can be considered approximate to WSN [ 5].

However, the service elements of device and network have recently  become superior 
and  user  demands  became  diversified  and  these  conditions  brought  the  need  of  more 
intellectualized  and  distributed  processing  [4].  This  is  suggesting  a  new  direction  for 
the  u-Health  service  to  change  from  the  current  WSN  type  to  the  M2m  type  in  the 
future. Within this context, this study will suggest a new smart healthcare service model 
based on IOT

for 

factors  and 

intelligent  application  needed 

The  Smart  healthcare  service  model  is  a  collaboration  model  which  acquires  risk 
factors needed for assessment from the network and reflects on them by real -time. Two 
types of factors are needed for this service. They are the collaboration protocol nee ded 
to  acquire 
reflected 
intellectualized assessment. Figure 3 defined the IOT based service model regarding the 
risk  factors  of  3  major  metabolic  syndromes.  First  of  all,  IOTXX  is  represented  as  a 
device which enables connection to the IOT network and autonomous collaboration and 
the  functions  of  each  device  was  indicted  as  xx.  In  Figure  3,  (a)  is  a  sp ecific 
representation  of  this.  In  terms  of  the  blood  pressure  monitor  (IOTBP),  only  the 
measured  blood  pressure  is  not  displayed.  Instead,  data  on  diabetes  measured  by  the 
glucose  meter  (IOTGL)  and  the  data  on  obesity  measured  by  the  weight  scale  (IOTOB) 
are  requested  to  acquire  the  result  [4].  If  data  cannot  be  immediately  sent  by  other 
IOTs, information stored by gateway (IOTGW) is requested for and attained. In addition 
to  this,  risk  factors  of  the  patient  such  as  the  gender,  age,  and  family  history  are 
received  by  the  u-Health  server  (IOTSVR).  However,  even  when  the  IOT  device  is  not 
within  the  network  reception  range  or  is  turned  off  just  as  it  is  shown  in  (b)  or  (c), 
information sent from IOTGW or IOTSVR are applied to assess the measurement value

Figure 3. Collaboration model between IOTs for the smart healthcare service 
 
IOTXX  must  collect  essential  information  by  real-time  to  effectively  construct  a 
collaboration  model.  In  order  to  do  so,  seamless  collaboration  protocol  is  needed 
between each IOTXX device. We propose the collaboration protocol at the next clause. 
 
3.2. Collaboration protocol between IoT personal health devices 

The  collaboration  protocol  is  an  application  protocol  which  sends  and  receives  risk 
factor  information  needed  between  IOT  devices  [4].  Since  u-Health  devices  used  in 
home connect to the home networks like Bluetooth or Zigbee, the protocol suggested in 
this paper is an application protocol over the WSN. In Figure 4, (a) displays an example 
of a protocol process in the case of (b) of  Figure 3. Once IOTBP operates, Join message 
is broadcasted and make known to all devices in the network.  During this tim e, IOTOB 
and  IOTGW  receive  the  Join  message,  but  IOTGL  is  not  able  to  receive  it.  IOTBP 
measures the blood pressure and sends the Data.Req message so that risk factors needed 
for assessment are gathered. 

IOTOB and IOTGW, which receive Data.Req message, send the Data.Ack message and 
the  risk  factor  information  of  relevant  patients  stored  by  each  device.    If  risk  factors 
about patients are not  available,  Data.Nak  is  sent to notify that there is  no  information 
available.  In  order  to  receive  the  newest  information,  Data.Req  is  sent  each  time  the 
blood  pressure  was  measured  so  that  the  latest  information  is  r eflected  on  the 
assessment. It was structured so that the Leave message is sent to make known that the 
network  was  left  from  when  the  power  of  the  IOT BP  became  switched  off  or 
measurement  was  terminated.  It  was  designed  so  that  the  overall  pr ocedures  can  take 
place seamlessly and user convenience was optimized

since  it  has  to  take  measurements  by  the  sensor  while  collecting  data  by  the  use  of

4. Evaluations 

The assessment  result  which only applied the diagnostic  guide  of the  blood pressure 
measurement  value  and  the  assessment  result  which  considered  each  risk  factor  were 
compared in order to confirm the effectiveness of the suggested model. The acquisition 
method  of  the  assessment  result  involved  modeling  virtual  IOT  a pplications  from  the 
Linux  system  and  conducting  the  experiment  where  suggested  protocol  message  are 
sent  a  100  times.  In  the  experiment,  a  total  of  1000  virtual  sample  patient  data  were 
produced per session and Figure 6 is a display of the result. 

In  Figure  6,  (a)  displays  how  the  number  of  experiments  where  blood  pressure  was 
(Normal+)  when  comprehensive 
assessed  as 
consideration  was  given  to  risk  factors.  However,  in  case  of  ‘warning’  in  (b),  the 
number of assessment actually increased significantly (Warning+).  

‘normal’  decreased  significantly

2. Related Researches 

The  metabolic  syndrome  refers  to  the  condition  where  more  than  3  amongst  the  5 
factors (glucose, blood  pressure, obesity,  triglycerides, and HDL  cholesterol) are  above 
standard  values  [4,  7].  A  metabolic  syndrome  can  cause  various  complications  such  as 
cardiovascular  disease  and  brain  stroke  [8].  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  manage  these 
risk  factors  during  daily  life.  However,  since  the  3  risk  factors  hold  close  mut ual 
relationship, it is necessary to  give complex consideration  to  various risk factors  when 
setting  the  diagnostic  criteria.  Additionally,  in  order  to  look  into  whether  processing 
about  the  complex  diagnostic  criteria  can  be  applied  to  the  IOT  machine,  structural 
characteristics of IOT will be explored. 
 
2.1. Risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome 

Generally,  states  of  diseases  are  assessed  according  to  the  degree  of  error  of  the 
measurement  value  in  comparison  to  the  normal  range  [4].  When  blood  pressure  is 
taken as  an example, it is assessed as  stage 1  hypertension  when the  measured systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) is over 140mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is over 
than  90mmHg  [4,  7].  However,  in  case  of  patients  diagnosed  with  diabetes  mellitus  or 
chronic  kidney  disease,  it  should  be  assessed  as  stage  1  hypertension  when  they  are 
over  130mmHg  or  80mmHg,  so  that  accurate  assessment  takes  places  when  the  fixed 
range is readjusted [4, 7]. 

This  displays  how  conducting  comprehensive  assessment  on  various  risk  factors 
instead of only the measured values during the stage of diagnosing the degree of disease 
will  provide  accurate  information  to  the  patient.  Due  to  these  reasons,  the  assessment 
procedure  for  hypertension  gives  comprehensive  consideration 
to  SBP,  DBP, 
prevalence  rate  following  the  age  and  gender,  the  current  state  of  personal  disease 
(diagnostic results for obesity and diabetes mellitus), and family history as Figure 1 [7]. 
But most medical sensor devices do not give comprehensive assessmen t. 

Even in case of type 2 diabetes which consists for more than 90% of diabetes disease, 
consideration  is  made  for  glucose  measurement  value  along  with  risk  factors  such  as 
obesity, drinking, age, gender, personal disease, and family  history [9, 10]. Table 1 is a 
display  of  each  evaluative  result  which  is  in  accordance  to  the  range  of  measurement 
values  for  blood  pressure,  glucose,  BMI(Body  Mass  Index),  and  waise  circumference. 
In terms of the assessment scale for obesity, BMI and waist circumference are applied. 
As a result, obesity was classifed as a risk factor which caused influence in diabetes and 
blood pressure [10, 11].

2.2. Structural Characteristic of IoT 

IOT is a conceptual model which provides service for human beings through things, which 
possess  innate  roles,  maintain  mutually  autonomous  collaboration  system  centered  on  the 
network  and  minimize  human  intervention  [4,  5].  IOT  can  be  applied  to  different  types  of 
services,  and  common  application  service  elements  such  as  network  access  management, 
power  management,  identification  management,  and security  management  must  be  acquired 
[4,  12].  Moreover,  there  are  also  specific  application  service  elements  of  the  thing.  For 
instance,  in  case  of  IOT  sensor  thing,  sensor  management  and  intelligent  application  of 
sending  or  handling  measurement  data  are  specific  application  service  elements.  Therefore, 
Figure  2  is  a  representation  of  classification  between  common  application  service  elements 
and specific application the service elements.  

WSN  (Wireless  Sensor  Network)  and  M2M  (Machine-to-Machine  Communication) 
can  be  considered  as  other  examples  of  IOT.  In  case  of  WSN,  data  me asured  from  the 
sensor  is  sent  to  the  server  or  the  information  provided  by  the  server  hold  one-sided 
directivity  as  it  is  sent  to  the  actuator.  On  the  other  hand,  M2M  holds  bilate ralness  as 
processing  is  executed  through  autonomous  communication  between  each  device  [5].

Therefore, the current u-Health model where data measured from the medical sensor is 
sent to the u-Health server can be considered approximate to WSN [ 5].

However, the service elements of device and network have recently  become superior 
and  user  demands  became  diversified  and  these  conditions  brought  the  need  of  more 
intellectualized  and  distributed  processing  [4].  This  is  suggesting  a  new  direction  for 
the  u-Health  service  to  change  from  the  current  WSN  type  to  the  M2m  type  in  the 
future. Within this context, this study will suggest a new smart healthcare service model 
based on IOT

3.1. Collaboration model 

the 

risk 

for 

factors  and 

intelligent  application  needed 

The  Smart  healthcare  service  model  is  a  collaboration  model  which  acquires  risk 
factors needed for assessment from the network and reflects on them by real -time. Two 
types of factors are needed for this service. They are the collaboration protocol nee ded 
to  acquire 
reflected 
intellectualized assessment. Figure 3 defined the IOT based service model regarding the 
risk  factors  of  3  major  metabolic  syndromes.  First  of  all,  IOTXX  is  represented  as  a 
device which enables connection to the IOT network and autonomous collaboration and 
the  functions  of  each  device  was  indicted  as  xx.  In  Figure  3,  (a)  is  a  sp ecific 
representation  of  this.  In  terms  of  the  blood  pressure  monitor  (IOTBP),  only  the 
measured  blood  pressure  is  not  displayed.  Instead,  data  on  diabetes  measured  by  the 
glucose  meter  (IOTGL)  and  the  data  on  obesity  measured  by  the  weight  scale  (IOTOB) 
are  requested  to  acquire  the  result  [4].  If  data  cannot  be  immediately  sent  by  other 
IOTs, information stored by gateway (IOTGW) is requested for and attained. In addition 
to  this,  risk  factors  of  the  patient  such  as  the  gender,  age,  and  family  history  are 
received  by  the  u-Health  server  (IOTSVR).  However,  even  when  the  IOT  device  is  not 
within  the  network  reception  range  or  is  turned  off  just  as  it  is  shown  in  (b)  or  (c), 
information sent from IOTGW or IOTSVR are applied to assess the measurement value

Figure 3. Collaboration model between IOTs for the smart healthcare service 
 
IOTXX  must  collect  essential  information  by  real-time  to  effectively  construct  a 
collaboration  model.  In  order  to  do  so,  seamless  collaboration  protocol  is  needed 
between each IOTXX device. We propose the collaboration protocol at the next clause. 
 
3.2. Collaboration protocol between IoT personal health devices 

The  collaboration  protocol  is  an  application  protocol  which  sends  and  receives  risk 
factor  information  needed  between  IOT  devices  [4].  Since  u-Health  devices  used  in 
home connect to the home networks like Bluetooth or Zigbee, the protocol suggested in 
this paper is an application protocol over the WSN. In Figure 4, (a) displays an example 
of a protocol process in the case of (b) of  Figure 3. Once IOTBP operates, Join message 
is broadcasted and make known to all devices in the network.  During this tim e, IOTOB 
and  IOTGW  receive  the  Join  message,  but  IOTGL  is  not  able  to  receive  it.  IOTBP 
measures the blood pressure and sends the Data.Req message so that risk factors needed 
for assessment are gathered. 

IOTOB and IOTGW, which receive Data.Req message, send the Data.Ack message and 
the  risk  factor  information  of  relevant  patients  stored  by  each  device.    If  risk  factors 
about patients are not  available,  Data.Nak  is  sent to notify that there is  no  information 
available.  In  order  to  receive  the  newest  information,  Data.Req  is  sent  each  time  the 
blood  pressure  was  measured  so  that  the  latest  information  is  r eflected  on  the 
assessment. It was structured so that the Leave message is sent to make known that the 
network  was  left  from  when  the  power  of  the  IOT BP  became  switched  off  or 
measurement  was  terminated.  It  was  designed  so  that  the  overall  pr ocedures  can  take 
place seamlessly and user convenience was optimized

In  Figure  4,  (b)  represents  the  format  of  the  messages  used  during  the  transmission 
process  of  (a).  The  number  of  message  type  is  5  in  this  protocol.  ‘Join’  and  ‘Leave’ 
were  defined  without  ‘Payload’  in  order  to  minimize  the  transmission  overhead.  In 
medical  data  type  (M),  classification  was  made  between  blood  pressure,  glucose,  and 
obesity.  The  source  address  (S)  and  destination  address  (D)  of  the  IOT  device  were 
defined in the message. Additionally, the message includes the sequence number (N) of 
each  message,  length  of  payload.  And  also,  patient  identification  information  and  risk 
factors  were  defined  in  the  Payload.  Each  header  field  was  constructed  as  1  byte  and 
payload was defined as variable size. The information collec ted in form of this protocol 
is  applied  to  provide  comprehensive  consideration  to  the  relationship  between  mutual 
diseases  and  risk  factors.  In  the  next  clause,  definition  of  intelligent  application  which 
can manage this process will be explored 
 
3.3. Intellectualized service application 

Event-driven  model  is  appropriate  for  the  intelligent  application  operating  in  IOT 
since  it  has  to  take  measurements  by  the  sensor  while  collecting  data  by  the  use  of 
network.  Therefore,  as  it  is  displayed  in  Figure  5,  the  application  is  co nstructed  as  5 
major  events  and  their  event  handlers  for  processing.  The  first  event  is  a  boot  event 
which  occurs  when  the  power  is  turned  on  and  it  initializes  the  IOT  device  and 
the  measurement  event  which  occurs  when 
broadcasts 

the  Join  message.  In

measurement  button  is  pressed  to  measure  the  medical  data,  Data.Req  message  is  sent 
and measurement function is activated. 

DataAcquisition  event  occurs  when  the  measurement  becomes  terminated  and  the 
measurement data is acquired from the sensor.  Furthermore,  Receive  event also  o ccurs 
when  Data.Ack  or  Data.Nak  sent  from  other  device  becomes  received.  Accor dingly, 
Receive event must make progressing according to the types of received me ssage. Join 
and  Leave  messages  cause  for  IOT  Member  list  available  from  the  network  to  become 
added or deleted. Additionally, if the type of the received message is Data.Req, it is the 
request  to  send  risk  factors  (measurement  value  or  assessment  result)  of  the  patient 
designated in the Payload. 

 

Figure 5. Process flow in an IOT sensor application 

 
Therefore,  risk  factor  table  is  searched  and  Data.Ack  (or  Data.Nak)  message  is 
composed and sent. Moreover, this  algorithm was structured so that it does not suggest 
measurement value immediately upon the occurrence of DataAcquisition event and pass 
through  assessment  process  after  fixed  timeout.    In  order  to  receive  all  the  messages 
from other IOT devices in the network, time delay is needed .

4. Evaluations 

The assessment  result  which only applied the diagnostic  guide  of the  blood pressure 
measurement  value  and  the  assessment  result  which  considered  each  risk  factor  were 
compared in order to confirm the effectiveness of the suggested model. The acquisition 
method  of  the  assessment  result  involved  modeling  virtual  IOT  a pplications  from  the 
Linux  system  and  conducting  the  experiment  where  suggested  protocol  message  are 
sent  a  100  times.  In  the  experiment,  a  total  of  1000  virtual  sample  patient  data  were 
produced per session and Figure 6 is a display of the result. 

In  Figure  6,  (a)  displays  how  the  number  of  experiments  where  blood  pressure  was 
(Normal+)  when  comprehensive 
assessed  as 
consideration  was  given  to  risk  factors.  However,  in  case  of  ‘warning’  in  (b),  the 
number of assessment actually increased significantly (Warning+).  

‘normal’  decreased  significantly

This  signifies  how  comprehensive  assessment  cause  cases  assessed  as  ‘normal’  to

assessed  with  only the  measurement  value, it results  as  ‘warning’  when  assessed  along 
with  risk  factors.  In  case  of  (c),  minor  difference  is  displayed.  Assessment  result  of 
similar inclination resulted for glucose and obesity.

Abstract 

Management  of  chronic  diseases  is  important  to  self-management  for  health.    The  IoT 
concept  plays  a  significant  role  in  self-management  for  health.  In  order  to  accomplish  it, 
personal  health  devices  need  two  functions  such  as  application  network  protocol  and 
intelligent service. But, most of them have only simple function such as  indicating measured 
data and storing data temporarily.  In this research, we proposed an intelligent service model 
for  healthcare  which  gives  an  effective  feedback  to  an  individual.  In  order  to  do  this,  we 
introduced  the  collaboration  protocol  which  transfers  risk  factors  between  IoT  personal 
health devices. In addition to this, we proposed intellectualized service application algorithm 
which  will  be  operated  in  the  personal  health  device.  Finally,  based  on  the  findings  of  the 
experiment, the effectiveness was confirmed on proposed model.

1. Introduction 

Ubiquitous  health  (UH)  service  was  a  model  in  which  individual  medical  data  was 
measured  by  a  ubiquitous  personal  health  device  (UHD),  and  then  sent  to  the  health 
server  to  provide  feedback  to  medical  experts  and  patients  [1].  Thus,  most  researches 
were focused on the function of sending the measured biomedical data to the  server [1, 
2,  3].  Due  to  this  reason,  the  analysis  and  processing  function  of  medical  data  were 
mostly conducted in the server. 

As the concept of IoT (Internet of Things) was recently introduced, researches which 
attempt to apply the IOT model in different fields are being  progressed [4, 5, 6]. If IoT 
technique  is  applied  to  UH,  then  UHD  will  break  away  from  the  simple  functions  of 
indicating  measured  data  and  sending  them  to  the  server  and  execute  autonomous 
information  exchange  with  neighboring  systems  (UHDs,  gateway,  ser ver)  and  provide 
comprehensively  assessed  feedback  immediately  to  the  patient  [4].  For  instance,  a 
blood  pressure  which  is  above  140mmHg  is  generally  assessed  as  hypertension  [7].  If 
the  blood  pressure  measured  from  a  patient  with  symptoms  of  diabetes  mellitus  is 
135mmHg,  then  an  intellectualized  feedback  service  which  assesses  the  condition  as 
stage  1  hypertension  instead  of  prehypertension  can  be  provided  [7].  This  can  be 
provided  only  when  the  mutual  relationship  between  risk  factors  of  the  disease  is 
identified. 

In  this  research,  we  propose  an  intelligent  healthcare  service  model  that  can  enable 
personal  health  device  to  recognize  the  relationship  between  mutual  diseases  and  risk 
factors  and  provide  intellectualized  feedback  to  the  patient.  In  addition,  suggestion  is

made  for  the  assessment  algorithm  of  intellectualized  processing  essential  during  the 
modeling  procedure  and  collaboration  application  protocol  between  personal  health 
devices.  Furthermore,  it  is  presented  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  model  through 
experiments 

In  related  researches  presented  in  Chapter  2,  the  characteristics  and  diagnostic 
criteria  of  metabolic  syndrome,  a  major  risk  factor  of  chronic  diseases,  are  explored. 
Moreover, structural characteristics will be observed to identify the degree of suitability 
of  conceptual  model  of  IOT  on  U-Health.  In  Chapter  3,  suggestion  will  be  made  to 
intellectualized  collaboration  protocol  that  can  be  operated  in  IOT  based  UHD.  In 
Chapter  4,  virtual  data  is  utilized  to  conduct  experiment  and  experiment  results  are 
analyzed. Lastly, the conclusion will be presented in Chapter 5.  
 
2. Related Researches 

The  metabolic  syndrome  refers  to  the  condition  where  more  than  3  amongst  the  5 
factors (glucose, blood  pressure, obesity,  triglycerides, and HDL  cholesterol) are  above 
standard  values  [4,  7].  A  metabolic  syndrome  can  cause  various  complications  such  as 
cardiovascular  disease  and  brain  stroke  [8].  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  manage  these 
risk  factors  during  daily  life.  However,  since  the  3  risk  factors  hold  close  mut ual 
relationship, it is necessary to  give complex consideration  to  various risk factors  when 
setting  the  diagnostic  criteria.  Additionally,  in  order  to  look  into  whether  processing 
about  the  complex  diagnostic  criteria  can  be  applied  to  the  IOT  machine,  structural 
characteristics of IOT will be explored. 
 
2.1. Risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome 

Generally,  states  of  diseases  are  assessed  according  to  the  degree  of  error  of  the 
measurement  value  in  comparison  to  the  normal  range  [4].  When  blood  pressure  is 
taken as  an example, it is assessed as  stage 1  hypertension  when the  measured systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) is over 140mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is over 
than  90mmHg  [4,  7].  However,  in  case  of  patients  diagnosed  with  diabetes  mellitus  or 
chronic  kidney  disease,  it  should  be  assessed  as  stage  1  hypertension  when  they  are 
over  130mmHg  or  80mmHg,  so  that  accurate  assessment  takes  places  when  the  fixed 
range is readjusted [4, 7]. 

This  displays  how  conducting  comprehensive  assessment  on  various  risk  factors 
instead of only the measured values during the stage of diagnosing the degree of disease 
will  provide  accurate  information  to  the  patient.  Due  to  these  reasons,  the  assessment 
procedure  for  hypertension  gives  comprehensive  consideration 
to  SBP,  DBP, 
prevalence  rate  following  the  age  and  gender,  the  current  state  of  personal  disease 
(diagnostic results for obesity and diabetes mellitus), and family history as Figure 1 [7]. 
But most medical sensor devices do not give comprehensive assessmen t. 

Even in case of type 2 diabetes which consists for more than 90% of diabetes disease, 
consideration  is  made  for  glucose  measurement  value  along  with  risk  factors  such  as 
obesity, drinking, age, gender, personal disease, and family  history [9, 10]. Table 1 is a 
display  of  each  evaluative  result  which  is  in  accordance  to  the  range  of  measurement 
values  for  blood  pressure,  glucose,  BMI(Body  Mass  Index),  and  waise  circumference. 
In terms of the assessment scale for obesity, BMI and waist circumference are applied. 
As a result, obesity was classifed as a risk factor which caused influence in diabetes and 
blood pressure [10, 11].

2.2. Structural Characteristic of IoT 

IOT is a conceptual model which provides service for human beings through things, which 
possess  innate  roles,  maintain  mutually  autonomous  collaboration  system  centered  on  the 
network  and  minimize  human  intervention  [4,  5].  IOT  can  be  applied  to  different  types  of 
services,  and  common  application  service  elements  such  as  network  access  management, 
power  management,  identification  management,  and security  management  must  be  acquired 
[4,  12].  Moreover,  there  are  also  specific  application  service  elements  of  the  thing.  For 
instance,  in  case  of  IOT  sensor  thing,  sensor  management  and  intelligent  application  of 
sending  or  handling  measurement  data  are  specific  application  service  elements.  Therefore, 
Figure  2  is  a  representation  of  classification  between  common  application  service  elements 
and specific application the service elements.  

WSN  (Wireless  Sensor  Network)  and  M2M  (Machine-to-Machine  Communication) 
can  be  considered  as  other  examples  of  IOT.  In  case  of  WSN,  data  me asured  from  the 
sensor  is  sent  to  the  server  or  the  information  provided  by  the  server  hold  one-sided 
directivity  as  it  is  sent  to  the  actuator.  On  the  other  hand,  M2M  holds  bilate ralness  as 
processing  is  executed  through  autonomous  communication  between  each  device  [5].

Therefore, the current u-Health model where data measured from the medical sensor is 
sent to the u-Health server can be considered approximate to WSN [ 5].

However, the service elements of device and network have recently  become superior 
and  user  demands  became  diversified  and  these  conditions  brought  the  need  of  more 
intellectualized  and  distributed  processing  [4].  This  is  suggesting  a  new  direction  for 
the  u-Health  service  to  change  from  the  current  WSN  type  to  the  M2m  type  in  the 
future. Within this context, this study will suggest a new smart healthcare service model 
based on IOT 
 
3. Intelligent Healthcare Service 
 
3.1. Collaboration model 

the 

risk 

for 

factors  and 

intelligent  application  needed 

The  Smart  healthcare  service  model  is  a  collaboration  model  which  acquires  risk 
factors needed for assessment from the network and reflects on them by real -time. Two 
types of factors are needed for this service. They are the collaboration protocol nee ded 
to  acquire 
reflected 
intellectualized assessment. Figure 3 defined the IOT based service model regarding the 
risk  factors  of  3  major  metabolic  syndromes.  First  of  all,  IOTXX  is  represented  as  a 
device which enables connection to the IOT network and autonomous collaboration and 
the  functions  of  each  device  was  indicted  as  xx.  In  Figure  3,  (a)  is  a  sp ecific 
representation  of  this.  In  terms  of  the  blood  pressure  monitor  (IOTBP),  only  the 
measured  blood  pressure  is  not  displayed.  Instead,  data  on  diabetes  measured  by  the 
glucose  meter  (IOTGL)  and  the  data  on  obesity  measured  by  the  weight  scale  (IOTOB) 
are  requested  to  acquire  the  result  [4].  If  data  cannot  be  immediately  sent  by  other 
IOTs, information stored by gateway (IOTGW) is requested for and attained. In addition 
to  this,  risk  factors  of  the  patient  such  as  the  gender,  age,  and  family  history  are 
received  by  the  u-Health  server  (IOTSVR).  However,  even  when  the  IOT  device  is  not 
within  the  network  reception  range  or  is  turned  off  just  as  it  is  shown  in  (b)  or  (c), 
information sent from IOTGW or IOTSVR are applied to assess the measurement value

Figure 3. Collaboration model between IOTs for the smart healthcare service 
 
IOTXX  must  collect  essential  information  by  real-time  to  effectively  construct  a 
collaboration  model.  In  order  to  do  so,  seamless  collaboration  protocol  is  needed 
between each IOTXX device. We propose the collaboration protocol at the next clause. 
 
3.2. Collaboration protocol between IoT personal health devices 

The  collaboration  protocol  is  an  application  protocol  which  sends  and  receives  risk 
factor  information  needed  between  IOT  devices  [4].  Since  u-Health  devices  used  in 
home connect to the home networks like Bluetooth or Zigbee, the protocol suggested in 
this paper is an application protocol over the WSN. In Figure 4, (a) displays an example 
of a protocol process in the case of (b) of  Figure 3. Once IOTBP operates, Join message 
is broadcasted and make known to all devices in the network.  During this tim e, IOTOB 
and  IOTGW  receive  the  Join  message,  but  IOTGL  is  not  able  to  receive  it.  IOTBP 
measures the blood pressure and sends the Data.Req message so that risk factors needed 
for assessment are gathered. 

IOTOB and IOTGW, which receive Data.Req message, send the Data.Ack message and 
the  risk  factor  information  of  relevant  patients  stored  by  each  device.    If  risk  factors 
about patients are not  available,  Data.Nak  is  sent to notify that there is  no  information 
available.  In  order  to  receive  the  newest  information,  Data.Req  is  sent  each  time  the 
blood  pressure  was  measured  so  that  the  latest  information  is  r eflected  on  the 
assessment. It was structured so that the Leave message is sent to make known that the 
network  was  left  from  when  the  power  of  the  IOT BP  became  switched  off  or 
measurement  was  terminated.  It  was  designed  so  that  the  overall  pr ocedures  can  take 
place seamlessly and user convenience was optimized

In  Figure  4,  (b)  represents  the  format  of  the  messages  used  during  the  transmission 
process  of  (a).  The  number  of  message  type  is  5  in  this  protocol.  ‘Join’  and  ‘Leave’ 
were  defined  without  ‘Payload’  in  order  to  minimize  the  transmission  overhead.  In 
medical  data  type  (M),  classification  was  made  between  blood  pressure,  glucose,  and 
obesity.  The  source  address  (S)  and  destination  address  (D)  of  the  IOT  device  were 
defined in the message. Additionally, the message includes the sequence number (N) of 
each  message,  length  of  payload.  And  also,  patient  identification  information  and  risk 
factors  were  defined  in  the  Payload.  Each  header  field  was  constructed  as  1  byte  and 
payload was defined as variable size. The information collec ted in form of this protocol 
is  applied  to  provide  comprehensive  consideration  to  the  relationship  between  mutual 
diseases  and  risk  factors.  In  the  next  clause,  definition  of  intelligent  application  which 
can manage this process will be explored 
 
3.3. Intellectualized service application 

Event-driven  model  is  appropriate  for  the  intelligent  application  operating  in  IOT 
since  it  has  to  take  measurements  by  the  sensor  while  collecting  data  by  the  use  of 
network.  Therefore,  as  it  is  displayed  in  Figure  5,  the  application  is  co nstructed  as  5 
major  events  and  their  event  handlers  for  processing.  The  first  event  is  a  boot  event 
which  occurs  when  the  power  is  turned  on  and  it  initializes  the  IOT  device  and 
the  measurement  event  which  occurs  when 
broadcasts 

the  Join  message.  In 

160

measurement  button  is  pressed  to  measure  the  medical  data,  Data.Req  message  is  sent 
and measurement function is activated. 

DataAcquisition  event  occurs  when  the  measurement  becomes  terminated  and  the 
measurement data is acquired from the sensor.  Furthermore,  Receive  event also  o ccurs 
when  Data.Ack  or  Data.Nak  sent  from  other  device  becomes  received.  Accor dingly, 
Receive event must make progressing according to the types of received me ssage. Join 
and  Leave  messages  cause  for  IOT  Member  list  available  from  the  network  to  become 
added or deleted. Additionally, if the type of the received message is Data.Req, it is the 
request  to  send  risk  factors  (measurement  value  or  assessment  result)  of  the  patient 
designated in the Payload. 

 

Figure 5. Process flow in an IOT sensor application 

 
Therefore,  risk  factor  table  is  searched  and  Data.Ack  (or  Data.Nak)  message  is 
composed and sent. Moreover, this  algorithm was structured so that it does not suggest 
measurement value immediately upon the occurrence of DataAcquisition event and pass 
through  assessment  process  after  fixed  timeout.    In  order  to  receive  all  the  messages 
from other IOT devices in the network, time delay is needed .

4. Evaluations 

The assessment  result  which only applied the diagnostic  guide  of the  blood pressure 
measurement  value  and  the  assessment  result  which  considered  each  risk  factor  were 
compared in order to confirm the effectiveness of the suggested model. The acquisition 
method  of  the  assessment  result  involved  modeling  virtual  IOT  a pplications  from  the 
Linux  system  and  conducting  the  experiment  where  suggested  protocol  message  are 
sent  a  100  times.  In  the  experiment,  a  total  of  1000  virtual  sample  patient  data  were 
produced per session and Figure 6 is a display of the result. 

In  Figure  6,  (a)  displays  how  the  number  of  experiments  where  blood  pressure  was 
(Normal+)  when  comprehensive 
assessed  as 
consideration  was  given  to  risk  factors.  However,  in  case  of  ‘warning’  in  (b),  the 
number of assessment actually increased significantly (Warning+).  

‘normal’  decreased  significantly

Figure 6. Evaluation of the experiments 

 
This  signifies  how  comprehensive  assessment  cause  cases  assessed  as  ‘normal’  to 
become  assessed  as  ‘warning,’  In  other  words,  even  in  cases  when  ‘normal’  results  if 
assessed  with  only the  measurement  value, it results  as  ‘warning’  when  assessed  along 
with  risk  factors.  In  case  of  (c),  minor  difference  is  displayed.  Assessment  result  of 
similar inclination resulted for glucose and obesity. 
 
5. Conclusion 

 In this paper, proposed intelligent health service is enabled to over all assessment by 
the collaboration to exchange the risk factors such as blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, 
between personal health devices  
it  was  also  displayed 

that 
comprehensive  assessment  management  provide  more  clear  information  about  the 
patient’s  state  in  comparison  to  simple  assessment  management  and  it  was  considered 
as an effective model applied for patients to autonomously manage metabolic syndrome
