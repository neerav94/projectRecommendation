Abstract 

Modern  buildings  around  the  world  have  become  complex  and  augmented.  Given  the 
structural  characteristics  of  modern  buildings,  quick  evacuation  using  emergency  exits  or 
evacuee  guidance  markers  during  blackouts  due  to  fire,  building  collapse,  earthquakes,  or 
aging of buildings need to be possible. 

 This paper suggests an Internet of Things(IoT)-based intelligent fire emergency response 
system that can control directional guidance intelligently according to the time and location 
of a disaster and the design of an integrated control system using wireless sensor networks to 
address  the  problems  with  existing  fire  emergency  response  systems  in  times  of  fire  or 
building collapse.

1. Introduction 

Taking  more  than  20  minutes  to  evacuate  from  a  fire,  which  is  one  of the  most  frequent 
disasters,  greatly  reduces  survivability  [1, 9,  12].  Uniform  evacuation  guidance such as  exit 
lights are inadequate for guiding evacuees during a fire, which can create poisonous gases, or 
when  buildings  are  collapsing  [2-3,  8].  Because  existing  emergency  exit  guides  do  not 
consider the location of the fire and merely direct people to the nearest exit, this may create 
significant secondary casualties if a fire has occurred at the exit and the evacuees are guided 
towards it. This paper suggests an IoT-based intelligent fire emergency response system with 
decentralized control that can intelligently guide evacuees based on the location and time of a 
fire to minimize the loss of human life.

Abstract 

Modern  buildings  around  the  world  have  become  complex  and  augmented.  Given  the 
structural  characteristics  of  modern  buildings,  quick  evacuation  using  emergency  exits  or 
evacuee  guidance  markers  during  blackouts  due  to  fire,  building  collapse,  earthquakes,  or 
aging of buildings need to be possible. 

 This paper suggests an Internet of Things(IoT)-based intelligent fire emergency response 
system that can control directional guidance intelligently according to the time and location 
of a disaster and the design of an integrated control system using wireless sensor networks to 
address  the  problems  with  existing  fire  emergency  response  systems  in  times  of  fire  or 
building collapse.

1. Introduction 

Taking  more  than  20  minutes  to  evacuate  from  a  fire,  which  is  one  of the  most  frequent 
disasters,  greatly  reduces  survivability  [1, 9,  12].  Uniform  evacuation  guidance such as  exit 
lights are inadequate for guiding evacuees during a fire, which can create poisonous gases, or 
when  buildings  are  collapsing  [2-3,  8].  Because  existing  emergency  exit  guides  do  not 
consider the location of the fire and merely direct people to the nearest exit, this may create 
significant secondary casualties if a fire has occurred at the exit and the evacuees are guided 
towards it. This paper suggests an IoT-based intelligent fire emergency response system with 
decentralized control that can intelligently guide evacuees based on the location and time of a 
fire to minimize the loss of human life.

2.1 Detection Sensors 

Sensors  such  as  smoke  detectors,  flame  detectors,  heat  detectors,  vibration  sensors, 
ultrasonic  sensors,  pressure  sensors,  proximity  sensors,  and  location  control  sensors 
convert and output the recognition of fire, information on the progression of a fire and 
poisonous gas, and the vibrational state of the building into an electric signal  [4, 13]. 
 
2.2 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) 

The  network  is  composed  of  dispersed  sensor  nodes  that  measure  the  physical  and 
environmental  conditions  such  as  the  temperature  and  pressure,  gateways  that  collect 
information  from  the  nodes  wirelessly  and  relay  the  information  to  the  central  server,

High-rise  buildings  have  become  complex  and  enlarged.  Hence,  the  system  needs  to 
facilitate quick and safe evacuation out of the building exits during blackouts due to natural 
disasters such as fire, building collapse, or an earthquake when vision has been impeded (e.g.,

confusion  of  the  emergency  lights  and  inappropriate  evacuation  guidance.  The  intelligent 
emergency  evacuation  system  can  also  aid  firefighting  because  it  allows  for  a  quick 
assessment  of  the  exact  location  of  the  fire  by  integrating  the  intelligent  and  automated 
evacuation  system  with  the  central  national  emergency  management  agency.  It  reduces 
casualties  and  the  time  required  for  evacuation  by  guiding  evacuees  into  dispersed  detours 
that bypass the location of the fire. 

Future studies will focus on expanding the applicability of this system to not only building 
disasters,  but  also  various  fields  such  as  ocean  vessels  and  evacuation  within  buildings, 
disaster safety through Web or mobile application services, and preventive actions for optimal 
disaster recovery.

Abstract 

Modern  buildings  around  the  world  have  become  complex  and  augmented.  Given  the 
structural  characteristics  of  modern  buildings,  quick  evacuation  using  emergency  exits  or 
evacuee  guidance  markers  during  blackouts  due  to  fire,  building  collapse,  earthquakes,  or 
aging of buildings need to be possible. 

 This paper suggests an Internet of Things(IoT)-based intelligent fire emergency response 
system that can control directional guidance intelligently according to the time and location 
of a disaster and the design of an integrated control system using wireless sensor networks to 
address  the  problems  with  existing  fire  emergency  response  systems  in  times  of  fire  or 
building collapse.

1. Introduction 

Taking  more  than  20  minutes  to  evacuate  from  a  fire,  which  is  one  of the  most  frequent 
disasters,  greatly  reduces  survivability  [1, 9,  12].  Uniform  evacuation  guidance such as  exit 
lights are inadequate for guiding evacuees during a fire, which can create poisonous gases, or 
when  buildings  are  collapsing  [2-3,  8].  Because  existing  emergency  exit  guides  do  not 
consider the location of the fire and merely direct people to the nearest exit, this may create 
significant secondary casualties if a fire has occurred at the exit and the evacuees are guided 
towards it. This paper suggests an IoT-based intelligent fire emergency response system with 
decentralized control that can intelligently guide evacuees based on the location and time of a 
fire to minimize the loss of human life. 
 
2. Relevant Research 
 
2.1 Detection Sensors 

Sensors  such  as  smoke  detectors,  flame  detectors,  heat  detectors,  vibration  sensors, 
ultrasonic  sensors,  pressure  sensors,  proximity  sensors,  and  location  control  sensors 
convert and output the recognition of fire, information on the progression of a fire and 
poisonous gas, and the vibrational state of the building into an electric signal  [4, 13]. 
 
2.2 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) 

The  network  is  composed  of  dispersed  sensor  nodes  that  measure  the  physical  and 
environmental  conditions  such  as  the  temperature  and  pressure,  gateways  that  collect 
information  from  the  nodes  wirelessly  and  relay  the  information  to  the  central  server,

and user interface software for storing, managing, analyzing, and utilizing the co llected 
information  [4-5].  As  shown  in  Figure  1,  ZigBee  is  generally  used  for  wireless 
communication  between  sensor  nodes.  The  observed  data  are  relayed  to  the  gateway 
through flooding.

High-rise  buildings  have  become  complex  and  enlarged.  Hence,  the  system  needs  to 
facilitate quick and safe evacuation out of the building exits during blackouts due to natural 
disasters such as fire, building collapse, or an earthquake when vision has been impeded (e.g.,

by  smoke)  [7].  All  evacuees  within  a  building  should  be  alerted  and  guided  to  an  optimal 
evacuation  point  remote  from  the  point  of  the  disaster  through  pop-up  notices  based  on 
analysis of the data received by detection sensors during disasters such as a fire [10-11].

3.1 System Composition 

The  proposed  intelligent  fire  emergency  response  system  is  designed  to  improve  the 
evacuation  safety  and  reliability  shown  in  Figure  2.  Human  cognitive  characteristics  and 
intelligent evacuation equipment  concepts  were  utilized  for  the  development  of an  effective 
detour evacuation system that alters the evacuation directions according to the situation and 
location of the fire. 

 

Figure 2. Fire Judge Module 

 

- Figure 3 shows an intelligent optimal evacuation route where the processor controls the 
direction  of  the  guidance  lights  based  on  various  detectors  and  the  evacuation  guidance 
design. 

-  The  fire  emergency  response  system  designs  the  path  to  evacuation  locations  through 
various detours depending on situational conditions such as fire, visibility, and the number of 
evacuees. 

-  Guide  lights  toward  the  optimal  evacuation  locations  are  lit  during  disasters  through 
cooperation  between  the  disaster  prevention  system  of  the  relevant  building  and  the 
government’s central disaster prevention system; bidirectional data are integrated when fire or 
smoke is detected. 

-  The  system  environment  composition  modules  are  designed  to  comprise  an  Ember 
EM250  chipset,  sensor  modules,  a  CDD  controller,  a  communication  module,  a  power 
module, a CSD controller, an LED display, and buzzers

3.3 Design of Integrated Control System Module 

Lights create a connection between the information shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the 
system,  where  information  is  detected  by  the  various  sensors  of  the  emergency  lights  and 
analyzed  through  the  controller.  The  information  is  collected  and  relayed  to  the  operating 
server,  which  receives  information  on  the  analyzed  evacuation  path  and  messages  the 
smartphones of the evacuees located on the relevant floor.

3.4 Smartphone Application Development 

Figure 7 shows a smartphone app developed to alert evacuees of the building to a fire and 
allow evacuees who could not escape by following the emergency lights and whose visibility 
is obstructed by smoke to check their location and the evacuation path. The app provides the 
building  blueprints  and  evacuation  map  necessary  for  evacuation  (a)  to  2G  phones  as  text 
information  and  (b)  to  3G  phones  as  text  information  and  in  the  form  of  an  App.  The 
information allows the approximate location of an evacuee to be assessed for a quick rescue 
based  on  the  information  on  the  time  and  location  of  the  ignition,  progression  of  the  fire, 
direction  of  the  evacuation  route,  and  connection  with  the  integrated  control  center through 
the App.

4. Conclusion 

The proposed IoT-based intelligent fire emergency response system can reduce casualties 
by  determining  the  point  of  occurrence  of  a  disaster  in  a  building  to  prevent  directional

confusion  of  the  emergency  lights  and  inappropriate  evacuation  guidance.  The  intelligent 
emergency  evacuation  system  can  also  aid  firefighting  because  it  allows  for  a  quick 
assessment  of  the  exact  location  of  the  fire  by  integrating  the  intelligent  and  automated 
evacuation  system  with  the  central  national  emergency  management  agency.  It  reduces 
casualties  and  the  time  required  for  evacuation  by  guiding  evacuees  into  dispersed  detours 
that bypass the location of the fire. 

Future studies will focus on expanding the applicability of this system to not only building 
disasters,  but  also  various  fields  such  as  ocean  vessels  and  evacuation  within  buildings, 
disaster safety through Web or mobile application services, and preventive actions for optimal 
disaster recovery.
