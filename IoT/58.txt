Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incor-
porate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different
and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of
digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is
hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large
variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may
be involved in such a system. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally to
an urban IoT systems that, while still being quite a broad category,
are characterized by their speciﬁc application domain. Urban
IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which
aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies
to support added-value services for the administration of the city
and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive
survey of the enabling technologies, protocols and architecture for
an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the
Padova Smart City project, a proof of concept deployment of an
IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration
with the city municipality.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE IoT is a recent communication paradigm that en-

visions a near future in which the objects of everyday
life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for
digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will
make them able to communicate with one another and with
the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

penetration of ICT solutions in this domain, however, may
result in signiﬁcant savings and economical and ecological
advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste contain-
ers that detect the level of load and allow for an optimization
of the collector trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste
collection and improve the quality of recycling [14], [15]. To
realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT shall
connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to
a control center where an optimization software processes the
data and determines the optimal management of the collector
truck ﬂeet.
Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc
hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring service
to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour
in the places that adopt the service [18]. Besides building
a space-time map of the noise pollution in the area, such
a service can also be used to enforce public security, by
means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for

instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service
can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and
the conﬁdence of public establishment owners, although the
installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power
widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Trafﬁc monitoring may be realized by using the
sensing capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles
[19], but also adopting a combination of air quality and
acoustic sensors along a given road. This information is of
great
importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline trafﬁc and to send ofﬁcers where needed,
for the latter to plan in advance the route to reach the ofﬁce
or to better schedule a shopping trip to the city centre.
City energy consumption. Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this
will make it possible to identify the main energy consumption
sources and to set priorities in order to optimize their behavior.
This goes in the direction indicated by the European directive
for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must
be integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it
will also be possible to enhance these service with active
functionalities to control local power production structures
(e.g., photovoltaic panels).

Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incor-
porate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different
and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of
digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is
hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large
variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may
be involved in such a system. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally to
an urban IoT systems that, while still being quite a broad category,
are characterized by their speciﬁc application domain. Urban
IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which
aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies
to support added-value services for the administration of the city
and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive
survey of the enabling technologies, protocols and architecture for
an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the
Padova Smart City project, a proof of concept deployment of an
IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration
with the city municipality.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE IoT is a recent communication paradigm that en-

visions a near future in which the objects of everyday
life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for
digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will
make them able to communicate with one another and with
the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

generated by such objects to provide new services to citi-
zens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm
indeed ﬁnds application in many different domains, such as
home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile
health care, elderly assistance, intelligent energy management
and smart grids, automotive, trafﬁc management and many
others [2].

However, such a heterogeneous ﬁeld of application makes
the identiﬁcation of solutions capable of satisfying the re-
quirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable
challenge. This difﬁculty has led to the proliferation of differ-
ent and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical
realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system per-
spective, the realization of an IoT network, together with the
required backend network services and devices, still lacks an
established best practice because of its novelty and complexity.
In addition to the technical difﬁculties, the adoption of the
IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and
widely accepted business model that can attract investments
to promote the deployment of these technologies [3].

the application of

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the
public administrations. This objective can be pursued by the
deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastruc-
ture that provides uniﬁed, simple, and economical access to a
plethora of public services, thus unleashing potential synergies
and increasing transparency to the citizens. An urban IoT,
indeed, may bring a number of beneﬁts in the management and
optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public
areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection,
salubrity of hospitals and school [5]. Furthermore, the avail-
ability of different types of data, collected by a pervasive
urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the transparency
and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of
their city, stimulate the active participation of the citizens in
the management of public administration, and also stimulate
the creation of new services upon those provided by the
IoT [6]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to
the Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional
administrations that may become the early adopters of such
technologies, thus acting as catalyzers for the adoption of the

IoT paradigm on a wider scale.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc

can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and

installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power

monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,

for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must

will also be possible to enhance these service with active
functionalities to control local power production structures
(e.g., photovoltaic panels).

III. URBAN IOT ARCHITECTURE

From the analysis of the services described in Sec. II, it
clearly emerges that most Smart City services are based on a
centralized architecture, where a dense and heterogeneous set
of peripheral devices deployed over the urban area generate
different types of data that are then delivered through suitable
communication technologies to a control center, where data
storage and processing are performed.

A primary characteristic of an urban IoT infrastructure,
hence, is its capability of integrating different technologies
with the existing communication infrastructures in order to
support a progressive evolution of the IoT, with the in-
terconnection of other devices and the realization of novel
functionalities and services. Another fundamental aspect is the
necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT
easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the
responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and promote the
awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters
[11].

In the rest of this section we describe the different compo-
nents of an urban IoT system, as sketched in Fig. 1. We start
describing the web service approach for the design of IoT
services, which requires the deployment of suitable protocol
layers in the different elements of the network, as shown in
the protocol stacks depicted in Fig. 1 besides the key elements
of the architecture. Then, we brieﬂy overview the link layer
technologies that can be used to interconnect the different
parts of the IoT. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous set
of devices that concur to the realization of an urban IoT.

A. Web service approach for IoT service architecture

Although in the IoT many different standards are still
struggling to be the reference one and the most adopted, in this
section we focus speciﬁcally on IETF standards because they
are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices,
and can count on a wide community.

The IETF standards for IoT embrace a web service archi-
tecture for IoT services, which has been widely documented
in the literature as a very promising and ﬂexible approach. In
fact, web services permit to realize a ﬂexible and interoperable
system that can be extended to IoT nodes, through the adoption
of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State
Transfer (ReST) [22]. IoT services designed in accordance
with the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with
traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption
and use of IoT by both end users and service developers,
which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge
gained from traditional web technologies in the development
of services for networks containing smart objects. The web
service approach is also promoted by international standard-
ization bodies such as IETF, ETSI and W3C, among others, as
well as European research projects on the Internet of Things
such as SENSEI [23], IoT-A [24] and SmartSantander [5].

Fig. 2 shows a reference protocol architecture for the
urban IoT system that entails both an unconstrained and a
constrained protocol stack. The ﬁrst consists of the protocols

service approach.

sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the
best path for parking in the city [20]. The beneﬁts deriving
from this service are manifold: faster time to locate a parking
slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
less trafﬁc
congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service
can be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure,
because many companies in Europe are providing market
products for this application. Furthermore, by using short-
range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identiﬁers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is
possible to realize an electronic veriﬁcation system of parking
permits in slots reserved for residents or disabled, thus offering
a better service to citizens that can legitimately use those slots
and an efﬁcient tool for quickly spot violations.

Smart lighting. In order to support the 202020 directive, the
optimization of the street lighting efﬁciency is an important
feature. In particular,
this service can optimize the street
lamp intensity according to the time of the day, the weather
conditions and the presence of people. In order to properly
work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit
the increased number of connected spots to provide WiFi
connection to citizens. In addition, a fault detection system
will be easily realized on top of the street light controllers.

Automation and salubrity of public buildings. Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of
the energy consumption and the salubrity of the environment
in public buildings (schools, administration ofﬁces, museums)
by means of different types of sensors and actuators that
control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters,
is possible to enhance the level of
comfort of the persons that live in these environments, which
may also have a positive return in terms of productivity, while
reducing the costs for heating/cooling [21].

IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

generated by such objects to provide new services to citi-
zens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm
indeed ﬁnds application in many different domains, such as
home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile
health care, elderly assistance, intelligent energy management
and smart grids, automotive, trafﬁc management and many
others [2].

However, such a heterogeneous ﬁeld of application makes
the identiﬁcation of solutions capable of satisfying the re-
quirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable
challenge. This difﬁculty has led to the proliferation of differ-
ent and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical
realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system per-
spective, the realization of an IoT network, together with the
required backend network services and devices, still lacks an
established best practice because of its novelty and complexity.
In addition to the technical difﬁculties, the adoption of the
IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and
widely accepted business model that can attract investments
to promote the deployment of these technologies [3].

the application of

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the
public administrations. This objective can be pursued by the
deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastruc-
ture that provides uniﬁed, simple, and economical access to a
plethora of public services, thus unleashing potential synergies
and increasing transparency to the citizens. An urban IoT,
indeed, may bring a number of beneﬁts in the management and
optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public
areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection,
salubrity of hospitals and school [5]. Furthermore, the avail-
ability of different types of data, collected by a pervasive
urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the transparency
and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of
their city, stimulate the active participation of the citizens in
the management of public administration, and also stimulate
the creation of new services upon those provided by the
IoT [6]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to
the Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional
administrations that may become the early adopters of such
technologies, thus acting as catalyzers for the adoption of the

IoT paradigm on a wider scale.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

penetration of ICT solutions in this domain, however, may
result in signiﬁcant savings and economical and ecological
advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste contain-
ers that detect the level of load and allow for an optimization
of the collector trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste
collection and improve the quality of recycling [14], [15]. To
realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT shall
connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to
a control center where an optimization software processes the
data and determines the optimal management of the collector
truck ﬂeet.
Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc
hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring service
to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour
in the places that adopt the service [18]. Besides building
a space-time map of the noise pollution in the area, such
a service can also be used to enforce public security, by
means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for

instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service
can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and
the conﬁdence of public establishment owners, although the
installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power
widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Trafﬁc monitoring may be realized by using the
sensing capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles
[19], but also adopting a combination of air quality and
acoustic sensors along a given road. This information is of
great
importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline trafﬁc and to send ofﬁcers where needed,
for the latter to plan in advance the route to reach the ofﬁce
or to better schedule a shopping trip to the city centre.
City energy consumption. Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this
will make it possible to identify the main energy consumption
sources and to set priorities in order to optimize their behavior.
This goes in the direction indicated by the European directive
for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must
be integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it
will also be possible to enhance these service with active
functionalities to control local power production structures
(e.g., photovoltaic panels).

Smart parking. The smart parking service is based on road

III. URBAN IOT ARCHITECTURE

From the analysis of the services described in Sec. II, it
clearly emerges that most Smart City services are based on a
centralized architecture, where a dense and heterogeneous set
of peripheral devices deployed over the urban area generate
different types of data that are then delivered through suitable
communication technologies to a control center, where data
storage and processing are performed.

A primary characteristic of an urban IoT infrastructure,
hence, is its capability of integrating different technologies
with the existing communication infrastructures in order to
support a progressive evolution of the IoT, with the in-
terconnection of other devices and the realization of novel
functionalities and services. Another fundamental aspect is the
necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT
easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the
responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and promote the
awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters
[11].

In the rest of this section we describe the different compo-
nents of an urban IoT system, as sketched in Fig. 1. We start
describing the web service approach for the design of IoT
services, which requires the deployment of suitable protocol
layers in the different elements of the network, as shown in
the protocol stacks depicted in Fig. 1 besides the key elements
of the architecture. Then, we brieﬂy overview the link layer
technologies that can be used to interconnect the different
parts of the IoT. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous set
of devices that concur to the realization of an urban IoT.

A. Web service approach for IoT service architecture

Although in the IoT many different standards are still
struggling to be the reference one and the most adopted, in this
section we focus speciﬁcally on IETF standards because they
are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices,
and can count on a wide community.

The IETF standards for IoT embrace a web service archi-
tecture for IoT services, which has been widely documented
in the literature as a very promising and ﬂexible approach. In
fact, web services permit to realize a ﬂexible and interoperable
system that can be extended to IoT nodes, through the adoption
of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State
Transfer (ReST) [22]. IoT services designed in accordance
with the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with
traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption
and use of IoT by both end users and service developers,
which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge
gained from traditional web technologies in the development
of services for networks containing smart objects. The web
service approach is also promoted by international standard-
ization bodies such as IETF, ETSI and W3C, among others, as
well as European research projects on the Internet of Things
such as SENSEI [23], IoT-A [24] and SmartSantander [5].

Fig. 2 shows a reference protocol architecture for the
urban IoT system that entails both an unconstrained and a
constrained protocol stack. The ﬁrst consists of the protocols

service approach.

sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the
best path for parking in the city [20]. The beneﬁts deriving
from this service are manifold: faster time to locate a parking
slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
less trafﬁc
congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service
can be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure,
because many companies in Europe are providing market
products for this application. Furthermore, by using short-
range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identiﬁers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is
possible to realize an electronic veriﬁcation system of parking
permits in slots reserved for residents or disabled, thus offering
a better service to citizens that can legitimately use those slots
and an efﬁcient tool for quickly spot violations.

Smart lighting. In order to support the 202020 directive, the
optimization of the street lighting efﬁciency is an important
feature. In particular,
this service can optimize the street
lamp intensity according to the time of the day, the weather
conditions and the presence of people. In order to properly
work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit
the increased number of connected spots to provide WiFi
connection to citizens. In addition, a fault detection system
will be easily realized on top of the street light controllers.

Automation and salubrity of public buildings. Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of
the energy consumption and the salubrity of the environment
in public buildings (schools, administration ofﬁces, museums)
by means of different types of sensors and actuators that
control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters,
is possible to enhance the level of
comfort of the persons that live in these environments, which
may also have a positive return in terms of productivity, while
reducing the costs for heating/cooling [21].

EXI processors share an XML Schema before actual encoding
and decoding can take place. This shared schema makes it
possible to assign numeric identiﬁers to the XML tags in the
schema and build the EXI grammars upon such coding. As
discussed in [27], a general purpose schema-informed EXI
processor can be easily integrated even in very constrained
devices, enabling them to interpret EXI formats and, hence,
making it possible to build multi-purpose IoT nodes even
out of very constrained devices. Using the schema-informed
approach, however, requires additional care in the development
of higher layer application, since developers need to deﬁne an
XML Schema for the messages involved in the application and
use EXI processors that support this operating mode. Further
details about EXI and schema-informed processing can be
found in [27].

Integration of multiple XML/EXI data sources into an IoT
system can be obtained by using the databases typically
created and maintained by high-level applications. In fact, IoT
applications generally build a database of the nodes controlled
by the application and, often, of the data generated by such
nodes. The database makes it possible to integrate the data
received by any IoT device to provide the speciﬁc service
the application is built for. A generic framework for building
IoT web applications according to the guidelines described
in this section has been proposed in [28], where the authors
also suggest exploiting the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
(AJAX) capabilities of modern web browsers that allow for a
direct communication between the browser and the ﬁnal IoT
node, demonstrating the full internetworking of the protocol
stack and the open data nature of the proposed approach.

2) Application and transport layers: Most of the trafﬁc that
crosses the Internet today is carried at the application layer by
HTTP over TCP. However, the verbosity and complexity of
native HTTP make it unsuitable for a straight deployment on
constrained IoT devices. For such an environment, in fact, the
human-readable format of HTTP, which has been one of the
reasons of its success in traditional networks, turns out to be
a limiting factor due to the large amount of heavily correlated
(and, hence, redundant) data. Moreover, HTTP typically relies
upon the TCP transport protocol that, however, does not scale
well on constrained devices, yielding poor performance for
small data ﬂows in lossy environments.

The CoAP protocol [29] overcomes these difﬁculties by
proposing a binary format transported over UDP, handling
only the retransmissions strictly required to provide a reliable
service. Moreover, CoAP can easily interoperate with HTTP
because: (i) it supports the ReST methods of HTTP (GET,
PUT, POST, and DELETE), (ii) there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the response codes of the two protocols,
and (iii) the CoAP options can support a wide range of HTTP
usage scenarios.

Even though regular Internet hosts can natively support
CoAP to directly talk to IoT devices, the most general and
easily interoperable solution requires the deployment of an
HTTP-CoAP intermediary, also known as cross proxy, that
can straightforwardly translate requests/responses between the
two protocols, thus enabling transparent interoperation with
native HTTP devices and applications [30].

nodes.

Protocol stacks for unconstrained (left) and constrained (right) IoT

that are currently the de-facto standards for Internet communi-
cations, and are commonly used by regular Internet hosts, such
as XML, HTTP, and IPv4. These protocols are mirrored in
the constrained protocol stack by their low-complexity coun-
terparts, i.e., the Efﬁcient XML Interchange (EXI), the Con-
strained Application Protocol (CoAP), and 6LoWPAN, which
are suitable even for very constrained devices. The transcoding
operations between the protocols in the left and right stacks
in Fig. 2 can be performed in a standard and low complexity
manner, thus guaranteeing easy access and interoperability of
the IoT nodes with the Internet. It may be worth remarking that
systems that do not adopt the EXI/CoAP/6LoWPAN protocol
stack can still be seamlessly included in the urban IoT system,
provided that they are capable of interfacing with all the layers
of the left-hand side of the protocol architecture in Fig. 2.

In the protocol architecture shown in Fig. 2 we can dis-
tinguish three distinct functional layers, namely (i) Data, (ii)
Application/Transport, and (iii) Network,
that may require
dedicated entities to operate the transcoding between con-
strained and unconstrained formats and protocols. In the rest
of this section, we specify in greater detail the requirements
at each of the three functional layers in order to guarantee
interoperability among the different parts of the system.

1) Data format: As mentioned, the urban IoT paradigm
sets speciﬁc requirements in terms of data accessibility. In
architectures based on web services, data exchange is typically
accompanied by a description of the transferred content by
means of semantic representation languages, of which the
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is probably the most
common. Nevertheless, the size of XML messages is often too
large for the limited capacity of typical devices for the IoT.
Furthermore, the text nature of XML representation makes the
parsing of messages by CPU-limited devices more complex
compared to the binary formats. For these reasons, the working
group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [25] has
proposed the EXI format [26], which makes it possible even
for very constrained devices to natively support and generate
messages using an open data format compatible with XML.
EXI deﬁnes two types of encoding, namely schema-less
and schema-informed. While the schema-less encoding is
generated directly from the XML data and can be decoded
by any EXI entity without any prior knowledge about the
data, the schema-informed encoding assumes that the two

Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incor-
porate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different
and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of
digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is
hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large
variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may
be involved in such a system. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally to
an urban IoT systems that, while still being quite a broad category,
are characterized by their speciﬁc application domain. Urban
IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which
aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies
to support added-value services for the administration of the city
and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive
survey of the enabling technologies, protocols and architecture for
an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the
Padova Smart City project, a proof of concept deployment of an
IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration
with the city municipality.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE IoT is a recent communication paradigm that en-

visions a near future in which the objects of everyday
life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for
digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will
make them able to communicate with one another and with
the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

generated by such objects to provide new services to citi-
zens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm
indeed ﬁnds application in many different domains, such as
home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile
health care, elderly assistance, intelligent energy management
and smart grids, automotive, trafﬁc management and many
others [2].

However, such a heterogeneous ﬁeld of application makes
the identiﬁcation of solutions capable of satisfying the re-
quirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable
challenge. This difﬁculty has led to the proliferation of differ-
ent and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical
realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system per-
spective, the realization of an IoT network, together with the
required backend network services and devices, still lacks an
established best practice because of its novelty and complexity.
In addition to the technical difﬁculties, the adoption of the
IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and
widely accepted business model that can attract investments
to promote the deployment of these technologies [3].

the application of

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the
public administrations. This objective can be pursued by the
deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastruc-
ture that provides uniﬁed, simple, and economical access to a
plethora of public services, thus unleashing potential synergies
and increasing transparency to the citizens. An urban IoT,
indeed, may bring a number of beneﬁts in the management and
optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public
areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection,
salubrity of hospitals and school [5]. Furthermore, the avail-
ability of different types of data, collected by a pervasive
urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the transparency
and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of
their city, stimulate the active participation of the citizens in
the management of public administration, and also stimulate
the creation of new services upon those provided by the
IoT [6]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to
the Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional
administrations that may become the early adopters of such
technologies, thus acting as catalyzers for the adoption of the

IoT paradigm on a wider scale.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

penetration of ICT solutions in this domain, however, may
result in signiﬁcant savings and economical and ecological
advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste contain-
ers that detect the level of load and allow for an optimization
of the collector trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste
collection and improve the quality of recycling [14], [15]. To
realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT shall
connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to
a control center where an optimization software processes the
data and determines the optimal management of the collector
truck ﬂeet.
Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc
hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring service
to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour
in the places that adopt the service [18]. Besides building
a space-time map of the noise pollution in the area, such
a service can also be used to enforce public security, by
means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for

instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service
can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and
the conﬁdence of public establishment owners, although the
installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power
widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Trafﬁc monitoring may be realized by using the
sensing capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles
[19], but also adopting a combination of air quality and
acoustic sensors along a given road. This information is of
great
importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline trafﬁc and to send ofﬁcers where needed,
for the latter to plan in advance the route to reach the ofﬁce
or to better schedule a shopping trip to the city centre.
City energy consumption. Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this
will make it possible to identify the main energy consumption
sources and to set priorities in order to optimize their behavior.
This goes in the direction indicated by the European directive
for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must
be integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it
will also be possible to enhance these service with active
functionalities to control local power production structures
(e.g., photovoltaic panels).

Smart parking. The smart parking service is based on road

III. URBAN IOT ARCHITECTURE

From the analysis of the services described in Sec. II, it
clearly emerges that most Smart City services are based on a
centralized architecture, where a dense and heterogeneous set
of peripheral devices deployed over the urban area generate
different types of data that are then delivered through suitable
communication technologies to a control center, where data
storage and processing are performed.

A primary characteristic of an urban IoT infrastructure,
hence, is its capability of integrating different technologies
with the existing communication infrastructures in order to
support a progressive evolution of the IoT, with the in-
terconnection of other devices and the realization of novel
functionalities and services. Another fundamental aspect is the
necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT
easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the
responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and promote the
awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters
[11].

In the rest of this section we describe the different compo-
nents of an urban IoT system, as sketched in Fig. 1. We start
describing the web service approach for the design of IoT
services, which requires the deployment of suitable protocol
layers in the different elements of the network, as shown in
the protocol stacks depicted in Fig. 1 besides the key elements
of the architecture. Then, we brieﬂy overview the link layer
technologies that can be used to interconnect the different
parts of the IoT. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous set
of devices that concur to the realization of an urban IoT.

A. Web service approach for IoT service architecture

Although in the IoT many different standards are still
struggling to be the reference one and the most adopted, in this
section we focus speciﬁcally on IETF standards because they
are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices,
and can count on a wide community.

The IETF standards for IoT embrace a web service archi-
tecture for IoT services, which has been widely documented
in the literature as a very promising and ﬂexible approach. In
fact, web services permit to realize a ﬂexible and interoperable
system that can be extended to IoT nodes, through the adoption
of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State
Transfer (ReST) [22]. IoT services designed in accordance
with the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with
traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption
and use of IoT by both end users and service developers,
which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge
gained from traditional web technologies in the development
of services for networks containing smart objects. The web
service approach is also promoted by international standard-
ization bodies such as IETF, ETSI and W3C, among others, as
well as European research projects on the Internet of Things
such as SENSEI [23], IoT-A [24] and SmartSantander [5].

Fig. 2 shows a reference protocol architecture for the
urban IoT system that entails both an unconstrained and a
constrained protocol stack. The ﬁrst consists of the protocols

service approach.

sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the
best path for parking in the city [20]. The beneﬁts deriving
from this service are manifold: faster time to locate a parking
slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
less trafﬁc
congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service
can be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure,
because many companies in Europe are providing market
products for this application. Furthermore, by using short-
range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identiﬁers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is
possible to realize an electronic veriﬁcation system of parking
permits in slots reserved for residents or disabled, thus offering
a better service to citizens that can legitimately use those slots
and an efﬁcient tool for quickly spot violations.

Smart lighting. In order to support the 202020 directive, the
optimization of the street lighting efﬁciency is an important
feature. In particular,
this service can optimize the street
lamp intensity according to the time of the day, the weather
conditions and the presence of people. In order to properly
work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit
the increased number of connected spots to provide WiFi
connection to citizens. In addition, a fault detection system
will be easily realized on top of the street light controllers.

Automation and salubrity of public buildings. Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of
the energy consumption and the salubrity of the environment
in public buildings (schools, administration ofﬁces, museums)
by means of different types of sensors and actuators that
control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters,
is possible to enhance the level of
comfort of the persons that live in these environments, which
may also have a positive return in terms of productivity, while
reducing the costs for heating/cooling [21].

EXI processors share an XML Schema before actual encoding
and decoding can take place. This shared schema makes it
possible to assign numeric identiﬁers to the XML tags in the
schema and build the EXI grammars upon such coding. As
discussed in [27], a general purpose schema-informed EXI
processor can be easily integrated even in very constrained
devices, enabling them to interpret EXI formats and, hence,
making it possible to build multi-purpose IoT nodes even
out of very constrained devices. Using the schema-informed
approach, however, requires additional care in the development
of higher layer application, since developers need to deﬁne an
XML Schema for the messages involved in the application and
use EXI processors that support this operating mode. Further
details about EXI and schema-informed processing can be
found in [27].

Integration of multiple XML/EXI data sources into an IoT
system can be obtained by using the databases typically
created and maintained by high-level applications. In fact, IoT
applications generally build a database of the nodes controlled
by the application and, often, of the data generated by such
nodes. The database makes it possible to integrate the data
received by any IoT device to provide the speciﬁc service
the application is built for. A generic framework for building
IoT web applications according to the guidelines described
in this section has been proposed in [28], where the authors
also suggest exploiting the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
(AJAX) capabilities of modern web browsers that allow for a
direct communication between the browser and the ﬁnal IoT
node, demonstrating the full internetworking of the protocol
stack and the open data nature of the proposed approach.

2) Application and transport layers: Most of the trafﬁc that
crosses the Internet today is carried at the application layer by
HTTP over TCP. However, the verbosity and complexity of
native HTTP make it unsuitable for a straight deployment on
constrained IoT devices. For such an environment, in fact, the
human-readable format of HTTP, which has been one of the
reasons of its success in traditional networks, turns out to be
a limiting factor due to the large amount of heavily correlated
(and, hence, redundant) data. Moreover, HTTP typically relies
upon the TCP transport protocol that, however, does not scale
well on constrained devices, yielding poor performance for
small data ﬂows in lossy environments.

The CoAP protocol [29] overcomes these difﬁculties by
proposing a binary format transported over UDP, handling
only the retransmissions strictly required to provide a reliable
service. Moreover, CoAP can easily interoperate with HTTP
because: (i) it supports the ReST methods of HTTP (GET,
PUT, POST, and DELETE), (ii) there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the response codes of the two protocols,
and (iii) the CoAP options can support a wide range of HTTP
usage scenarios.

Even though regular Internet hosts can natively support
CoAP to directly talk to IoT devices, the most general and
easily interoperable solution requires the deployment of an
HTTP-CoAP intermediary, also known as cross proxy, that
can straightforwardly translate requests/responses between the
two protocols, thus enabling transparent interoperation with
native HTTP devices and applications [30].

nodes.

Protocol stacks for unconstrained (left) and constrained (right) IoT

that are currently the de-facto standards for Internet communi-
cations, and are commonly used by regular Internet hosts, such
as XML, HTTP, and IPv4. These protocols are mirrored in
the constrained protocol stack by their low-complexity coun-
terparts, i.e., the Efﬁcient XML Interchange (EXI), the Con-
strained Application Protocol (CoAP), and 6LoWPAN, which
are suitable even for very constrained devices. The transcoding
operations between the protocols in the left and right stacks
in Fig. 2 can be performed in a standard and low complexity
manner, thus guaranteeing easy access and interoperability of
the IoT nodes with the Internet. It may be worth remarking that
systems that do not adopt the EXI/CoAP/6LoWPAN protocol
stack can still be seamlessly included in the urban IoT system,
provided that they are capable of interfacing with all the layers
of the left-hand side of the protocol architecture in Fig. 2.

In the protocol architecture shown in Fig. 2 we can dis-
tinguish three distinct functional layers, namely (i) Data, (ii)
Application/Transport, and (iii) Network,
that may require
dedicated entities to operate the transcoding between con-
strained and unconstrained formats and protocols. In the rest
of this section, we specify in greater detail the requirements
at each of the three functional layers in order to guarantee
interoperability among the different parts of the system.

1) Data format: As mentioned, the urban IoT paradigm
sets speciﬁc requirements in terms of data accessibility. In
architectures based on web services, data exchange is typically
accompanied by a description of the transferred content by
means of semantic representation languages, of which the
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is probably the most
common. Nevertheless, the size of XML messages is often too
large for the limited capacity of typical devices for the IoT.
Furthermore, the text nature of XML representation makes the
parsing of messages by CPU-limited devices more complex
compared to the binary formats. For these reasons, the working
group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [25] has
proposed the EXI format [26], which makes it possible even
for very constrained devices to natively support and generate
messages using an open data format compatible with XML.
EXI deﬁnes two types of encoding, namely schema-less
and schema-informed. While the schema-less encoding is
generated directly from the XML data and can be decoded
by any EXI entity without any prior knowledge about the
data, the schema-informed encoding assumes that the two

ogy supported by Internet hosts. However, IANA, the interna-
tional organization that assigns IP addresses at a global level,
has recently announced the exhaustion of IPv4 address blocks.
IoT networks, in turn, are expected to include billions of nodes,
each of which shall be (in principle) uniquely addressable. A
solution to this problem is offered by the IPv6 standard [31],
which provides a 128-bit address ﬁeld, thus making it possible
to assign a unique IPv6 address to any possible node in the
IoT network.

While, on the one hand, the huge address space of IPv6
makes it possible to solve the addressing issues in IoT, on
the other hand it introduces overheads that are not compat-
ible with the scarce capabilities of constrained nodes. This
problem can be overcome by adopting 6LoWPAN [32] [33],
which is an established compression format for IPv6 and
UDP headers over low-power constrained networks. A border
router, that is a device directly attached to the 6LoWPAN net-
work, transparently performs the conversion between IPv6 and
6LoWPAN, translating any IPv6 packet intended for a node in
the 6LoWPAN network into a packet with 6LoWPAN header
compression format, and operating the inverse translation in
the opposite direction.

While the deployment of a 6LoWPAN border router enables
transparent interaction between IoT nodes and any IPv6 host
in the Internet, the interaction with IPv4-only hosts remains
an issue. More speciﬁcally, the problem consists in ﬁnding a
way to address a speciﬁc IPv6 host using an IPv4 address and
other meta-data available in the packet. In the following we
present different approaches to achieve this goal.

v4/v6 Port Address Translation (v4/v6 PAT). This method
maps arbitrary pairs of IPv4 addresses and TCP/UDP ports
into IPv6 addresses and TCP/UDP ports. It resembles the clas-
sical Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) service
currently supported in many LANs to provide Internet access
to a number of hosts in a private network by sharing a common
public IPv4 address, which is used to address the packets
over the public Internet. When a packet is returned to the
IPv4 common address, the edge router that supports the NATP
service will intercept the packet and replace the common IPv4
destination address with the (private) address of the intended
receiver, which is determined by looking up in the NATP table
the address of the host associated to the speciﬁc destination
port carried by the packet. The same technique can be used
to map multiple IPv6 addresses into a single IPv4 public
address, which allows the forwarding of the datagrams in the
IPv4 network and its correct management at IPv4-only hosts.
The application of this technique requires low complexity
and, indeed, port mapping is an established technique for
v4/v6 transition. On the other hand, this approach raises a
scalability problem, since the number of IPv6 hosts that can
be multiplexed into a single IPv4 address is limited by the
number of available TCP/UDP ports (65535). Furthermore,
this approach requires that the connection be initiated by the
IPv6 nodes in order to create the correct entries in the NATP
look up table. Connections starting from the IPv4 cloud can
also be realized, but this requires a more complex architecture,
with the local DNS placed within the IPv6 network and

6

statically associated to a public IPv4 address in the NATP
translation table.

v4/v6 Domain Name Conversion. This method, originally
proposed in [30], is similar to the technique used to provide
virtual hosting service in HTTP 1.1, which makes it possible to
support multiple websites on the same web server, sharing the
same IPv4 address, by exploiting the information contained
in the HTTP Host header to identify the speciﬁc web site
requested by the user. Similarly, it is possible to program the
DNS servers in such a way that, upon a DNS request for
the domain name of an IoT web service, the DNS returns the
IPv4 address of an HTTP-CoAP cross proxy to be contacted to
access the IoT node. Once addressed by an HTTP request, the
proxy requires the resolution of the domain name contained in
the HTTP Host header to the IPv6 DNS server, which replies
with the IPv6 address that identiﬁes the ﬁnal IoT node involved
in the request. The proxy can then forward the HTTP message
to the intended IoT via CoAP.

URI mapping. The Universal Resource Identiﬁer (URI)
mapping technique is also described in [30]. This technique
involves a particular type of HTTP-CoAP cross proxy, the
reverse cross proxy. This proxy behaves as being the ﬁnal
web server to the HTTP/IPv4 client and as the original client
to the CoAP/IPv6 web server. Since this machine needs to
be placed in a part of the network where IPv6 connectivity is
present to allow direct access to the ﬁnal IoT nodes, IPv4/IPv6
conversion is internally resolved by the applied URI mapping
function.

B. Link Layer Technologies

An urban IoT system, due to its inherently large deployment
area, requires a set of link layer technologies that can easily
cover a wide geographical area and, at the same time, support a
possibly large amount of trafﬁc resulting from the aggregation
of an extremely high number of smaller data ﬂows. For these
reasons, link layer technologies enabling the realization of
an urban IoT system are classiﬁed into unconstrained and
constrained technologies. The ﬁrst group includes all the tra-
ditional LAN, MAN and WAN communication technologies,
such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ﬁber optic, broadband Power Line
Communication (PLC), and cellular technologies as such as
UMTS and LTE. They are generally characterized by high
reliability, low latency, and high transfer rates (order of Mbit/s
or higher), and due to their inherent complexity and energy
consumption are generally not suitable for peripheral IoT
nodes.

The constrained physical and link layer technologies are,
instead, generally characterized by low energy consump-
tion and relatively low transfer rates, typically smaller than
1 Mbit/s. The more prominent solutions in this category
are IEEE 802.15.4 [34], [35] Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low
Energy [36], IEEE 802.11 Low Power, Power Line Commu-
nication (PLC) [37], Near Field Communication (NFC) and
Radio Frequency Identiﬁer (RFID) [38]. These links usually
exhibit
long latencies, mainly due to two factors: (i) the
intrinsically low transmission rate at the physical layer, (ii)
the power saving policies implemented by the nodes to save

Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incor-
porate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different
and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of
digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is
hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large
variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may
be involved in such a system. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally to
an urban IoT systems that, while still being quite a broad category,
are characterized by their speciﬁc application domain. Urban
IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which
aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies
to support added-value services for the administration of the city
and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive
survey of the enabling technologies, protocols and architecture for
an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the
Padova Smart City project, a proof of concept deployment of an
IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration
with the city municipality.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE IoT is a recent communication paradigm that en-

visions a near future in which the objects of everyday
life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for
digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will
make them able to communicate with one another and with
the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

generated by such objects to provide new services to citi-
zens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm
indeed ﬁnds application in many different domains, such as
home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile
health care, elderly assistance, intelligent energy management
and smart grids, automotive, trafﬁc management and many
others [2].

However, such a heterogeneous ﬁeld of application makes
the identiﬁcation of solutions capable of satisfying the re-
quirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable
challenge. This difﬁculty has led to the proliferation of differ-
ent and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical
realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system per-
spective, the realization of an IoT network, together with the
required backend network services and devices, still lacks an
established best practice because of its novelty and complexity.
In addition to the technical difﬁculties, the adoption of the
IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and
widely accepted business model that can attract investments
to promote the deployment of these technologies [3].

the application of

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the
public administrations. This objective can be pursued by the
deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastruc-
ture that provides uniﬁed, simple, and economical access to a
plethora of public services, thus unleashing potential synergies
and increasing transparency to the citizens. An urban IoT,
indeed, may bring a number of beneﬁts in the management and
optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public
areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection,
salubrity of hospitals and school [5]. Furthermore, the avail-
ability of different types of data, collected by a pervasive
urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the transparency
and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of
their city, stimulate the active participation of the citizens in
the management of public administration, and also stimulate
the creation of new services upon those provided by the
IoT [6]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to
the Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional
administrations that may become the early adopters of such
technologies, thus acting as catalyzers for the adoption of the

IoT paradigm on a wider scale.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

penetration of ICT solutions in this domain, however, may
result in signiﬁcant savings and economical and ecological
advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste contain-
ers that detect the level of load and allow for an optimization
of the collector trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste
collection and improve the quality of recycling [14], [15]. To
realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT shall
connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to
a control center where an optimization software processes the
data and determines the optimal management of the collector
truck ﬂeet.
Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc
hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring service
to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour
in the places that adopt the service [18]. Besides building
a space-time map of the noise pollution in the area, such
a service can also be used to enforce public security, by
means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for

instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service
can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and
the conﬁdence of public establishment owners, although the
installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power
widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Trafﬁc monitoring may be realized by using the
sensing capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles
[19], but also adopting a combination of air quality and
acoustic sensors along a given road. This information is of
great
importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline trafﬁc and to send ofﬁcers where needed,
for the latter to plan in advance the route to reach the ofﬁce
or to better schedule a shopping trip to the city centre.
City energy consumption. Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this
will make it possible to identify the main energy consumption
sources and to set priorities in order to optimize their behavior.
This goes in the direction indicated by the European directive
for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must
be integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it
will also be possible to enhance these service with active
functionalities to control local power production structures
(e.g., photovoltaic panels).

Smart parking. The smart parking service is based on road

III. URBAN IOT ARCHITECTURE

From the analysis of the services described in Sec. II, it
clearly emerges that most Smart City services are based on a
centralized architecture, where a dense and heterogeneous set
of peripheral devices deployed over the urban area generate
different types of data that are then delivered through suitable
communication technologies to a control center, where data
storage and processing are performed.

A primary characteristic of an urban IoT infrastructure,
hence, is its capability of integrating different technologies
with the existing communication infrastructures in order to
support a progressive evolution of the IoT, with the in-
terconnection of other devices and the realization of novel
functionalities and services. Another fundamental aspect is the
necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT
easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the
responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and promote the
awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters
[11].

In the rest of this section we describe the different compo-
nents of an urban IoT system, as sketched in Fig. 1. We start
describing the web service approach for the design of IoT
services, which requires the deployment of suitable protocol
layers in the different elements of the network, as shown in
the protocol stacks depicted in Fig. 1 besides the key elements
of the architecture. Then, we brieﬂy overview the link layer
technologies that can be used to interconnect the different
parts of the IoT. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous set
of devices that concur to the realization of an urban IoT.

A. Web service approach for IoT service architecture

Although in the IoT many different standards are still
struggling to be the reference one and the most adopted, in this
section we focus speciﬁcally on IETF standards because they
are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices,
and can count on a wide community.

The IETF standards for IoT embrace a web service archi-
tecture for IoT services, which has been widely documented
in the literature as a very promising and ﬂexible approach. In
fact, web services permit to realize a ﬂexible and interoperable
system that can be extended to IoT nodes, through the adoption
of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State
Transfer (ReST) [22]. IoT services designed in accordance
with the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with
traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption
and use of IoT by both end users and service developers,
which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge
gained from traditional web technologies in the development
of services for networks containing smart objects. The web
service approach is also promoted by international standard-
ization bodies such as IETF, ETSI and W3C, among others, as
well as European research projects on the Internet of Things
such as SENSEI [23], IoT-A [24] and SmartSantander [5].

Fig. 2 shows a reference protocol architecture for the
urban IoT system that entails both an unconstrained and a
constrained protocol stack. The ﬁrst consists of the protocols

service approach.

sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the
best path for parking in the city [20]. The beneﬁts deriving
from this service are manifold: faster time to locate a parking
slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
less trafﬁc
congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service
can be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure,
because many companies in Europe are providing market
products for this application. Furthermore, by using short-
range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identiﬁers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is
possible to realize an electronic veriﬁcation system of parking
permits in slots reserved for residents or disabled, thus offering
a better service to citizens that can legitimately use those slots
and an efﬁcient tool for quickly spot violations.

Smart lighting. In order to support the 202020 directive, the
optimization of the street lighting efﬁciency is an important
feature. In particular,
this service can optimize the street
lamp intensity according to the time of the day, the weather
conditions and the presence of people. In order to properly
work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit
the increased number of connected spots to provide WiFi
connection to citizens. In addition, a fault detection system
will be easily realized on top of the street light controllers.

Automation and salubrity of public buildings. Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of
the energy consumption and the salubrity of the environment
in public buildings (schools, administration ofﬁces, museums)
by means of different types of sensors and actuators that
control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters,
is possible to enhance the level of
comfort of the persons that live in these environments, which
may also have a positive return in terms of productivity, while
reducing the costs for heating/cooling [21].

EXI processors share an XML Schema before actual encoding
and decoding can take place. This shared schema makes it
possible to assign numeric identiﬁers to the XML tags in the
schema and build the EXI grammars upon such coding. As
discussed in [27], a general purpose schema-informed EXI
processor can be easily integrated even in very constrained
devices, enabling them to interpret EXI formats and, hence,
making it possible to build multi-purpose IoT nodes even
out of very constrained devices. Using the schema-informed
approach, however, requires additional care in the development
of higher layer application, since developers need to deﬁne an
XML Schema for the messages involved in the application and
use EXI processors that support this operating mode. Further
details about EXI and schema-informed processing can be
found in [27].

Integration of multiple XML/EXI data sources into an IoT
system can be obtained by using the databases typically
created and maintained by high-level applications. In fact, IoT
applications generally build a database of the nodes controlled
by the application and, often, of the data generated by such
nodes. The database makes it possible to integrate the data
received by any IoT device to provide the speciﬁc service
the application is built for. A generic framework for building
IoT web applications according to the guidelines described
in this section has been proposed in [28], where the authors
also suggest exploiting the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
(AJAX) capabilities of modern web browsers that allow for a
direct communication between the browser and the ﬁnal IoT
node, demonstrating the full internetworking of the protocol
stack and the open data nature of the proposed approach.

2) Application and transport layers: Most of the trafﬁc that
crosses the Internet today is carried at the application layer by
HTTP over TCP. However, the verbosity and complexity of
native HTTP make it unsuitable for a straight deployment on
constrained IoT devices. For such an environment, in fact, the
human-readable format of HTTP, which has been one of the
reasons of its success in traditional networks, turns out to be
a limiting factor due to the large amount of heavily correlated
(and, hence, redundant) data. Moreover, HTTP typically relies
upon the TCP transport protocol that, however, does not scale
well on constrained devices, yielding poor performance for
small data ﬂows in lossy environments.

The CoAP protocol [29] overcomes these difﬁculties by
proposing a binary format transported over UDP, handling
only the retransmissions strictly required to provide a reliable
service. Moreover, CoAP can easily interoperate with HTTP
because: (i) it supports the ReST methods of HTTP (GET,
PUT, POST, and DELETE), (ii) there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the response codes of the two protocols,
and (iii) the CoAP options can support a wide range of HTTP
usage scenarios.

Even though regular Internet hosts can natively support
CoAP to directly talk to IoT devices, the most general and
easily interoperable solution requires the deployment of an
HTTP-CoAP intermediary, also known as cross proxy, that
can straightforwardly translate requests/responses between the
two protocols, thus enabling transparent interoperation with
native HTTP devices and applications [30].

nodes.

Protocol stacks for unconstrained (left) and constrained (right) IoT

that are currently the de-facto standards for Internet communi-
cations, and are commonly used by regular Internet hosts, such
as XML, HTTP, and IPv4. These protocols are mirrored in
the constrained protocol stack by their low-complexity coun-
terparts, i.e., the Efﬁcient XML Interchange (EXI), the Con-
strained Application Protocol (CoAP), and 6LoWPAN, which
are suitable even for very constrained devices. The transcoding
operations between the protocols in the left and right stacks
in Fig. 2 can be performed in a standard and low complexity
manner, thus guaranteeing easy access and interoperability of
the IoT nodes with the Internet. It may be worth remarking that
systems that do not adopt the EXI/CoAP/6LoWPAN protocol
stack can still be seamlessly included in the urban IoT system,
provided that they are capable of interfacing with all the layers
of the left-hand side of the protocol architecture in Fig. 2.

In the protocol architecture shown in Fig. 2 we can dis-
tinguish three distinct functional layers, namely (i) Data, (ii)
Application/Transport, and (iii) Network,
that may require
dedicated entities to operate the transcoding between con-
strained and unconstrained formats and protocols. In the rest
of this section, we specify in greater detail the requirements
at each of the three functional layers in order to guarantee
interoperability among the different parts of the system.

1) Data format: As mentioned, the urban IoT paradigm
sets speciﬁc requirements in terms of data accessibility. In
architectures based on web services, data exchange is typically
accompanied by a description of the transferred content by
means of semantic representation languages, of which the
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is probably the most
common. Nevertheless, the size of XML messages is often too
large for the limited capacity of typical devices for the IoT.
Furthermore, the text nature of XML representation makes the
parsing of messages by CPU-limited devices more complex
compared to the binary formats. For these reasons, the working
group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [25] has
proposed the EXI format [26], which makes it possible even
for very constrained devices to natively support and generate
messages using an open data format compatible with XML.
EXI deﬁnes two types of encoding, namely schema-less
and schema-informed. While the schema-less encoding is
generated directly from the XML data and can be decoded
by any EXI entity without any prior knowledge about the
data, the schema-informed encoding assumes that the two

ogy supported by Internet hosts. However, IANA, the interna-
tional organization that assigns IP addresses at a global level,
has recently announced the exhaustion of IPv4 address blocks.
IoT networks, in turn, are expected to include billions of nodes,
each of which shall be (in principle) uniquely addressable. A
solution to this problem is offered by the IPv6 standard [31],
which provides a 128-bit address ﬁeld, thus making it possible
to assign a unique IPv6 address to any possible node in the
IoT network.

While, on the one hand, the huge address space of IPv6
makes it possible to solve the addressing issues in IoT, on
the other hand it introduces overheads that are not compat-
ible with the scarce capabilities of constrained nodes. This
problem can be overcome by adopting 6LoWPAN [32] [33],
which is an established compression format for IPv6 and
UDP headers over low-power constrained networks. A border
router, that is a device directly attached to the 6LoWPAN net-
work, transparently performs the conversion between IPv6 and
6LoWPAN, translating any IPv6 packet intended for a node in
the 6LoWPAN network into a packet with 6LoWPAN header
compression format, and operating the inverse translation in
the opposite direction.

While the deployment of a 6LoWPAN border router enables
transparent interaction between IoT nodes and any IPv6 host
in the Internet, the interaction with IPv4-only hosts remains
an issue. More speciﬁcally, the problem consists in ﬁnding a
way to address a speciﬁc IPv6 host using an IPv4 address and
other meta-data available in the packet. In the following we
present different approaches to achieve this goal.

v4/v6 Port Address Translation (v4/v6 PAT). This method
maps arbitrary pairs of IPv4 addresses and TCP/UDP ports
into IPv6 addresses and TCP/UDP ports. It resembles the clas-
sical Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) service
currently supported in many LANs to provide Internet access
to a number of hosts in a private network by sharing a common
public IPv4 address, which is used to address the packets
over the public Internet. When a packet is returned to the
IPv4 common address, the edge router that supports the NATP
service will intercept the packet and replace the common IPv4
destination address with the (private) address of the intended
receiver, which is determined by looking up in the NATP table
the address of the host associated to the speciﬁc destination
port carried by the packet. The same technique can be used
to map multiple IPv6 addresses into a single IPv4 public
address, which allows the forwarding of the datagrams in the
IPv4 network and its correct management at IPv4-only hosts.
The application of this technique requires low complexity
and, indeed, port mapping is an established technique for
v4/v6 transition. On the other hand, this approach raises a
scalability problem, since the number of IPv6 hosts that can
be multiplexed into a single IPv4 address is limited by the
number of available TCP/UDP ports (65535). Furthermore,
this approach requires that the connection be initiated by the
IPv6 nodes in order to create the correct entries in the NATP
look up table. Connections starting from the IPv4 cloud can
also be realized, but this requires a more complex architecture,
with the local DNS placed within the IPv6 network and

6

statically associated to a public IPv4 address in the NATP
translation table.

v4/v6 Domain Name Conversion. This method, originally
proposed in [30], is similar to the technique used to provide
virtual hosting service in HTTP 1.1, which makes it possible to
support multiple websites on the same web server, sharing the
same IPv4 address, by exploiting the information contained
in the HTTP Host header to identify the speciﬁc web site
requested by the user. Similarly, it is possible to program the
DNS servers in such a way that, upon a DNS request for
the domain name of an IoT web service, the DNS returns the
IPv4 address of an HTTP-CoAP cross proxy to be contacted to
access the IoT node. Once addressed by an HTTP request, the
proxy requires the resolution of the domain name contained in
the HTTP Host header to the IPv6 DNS server, which replies
with the IPv6 address that identiﬁes the ﬁnal IoT node involved
in the request. The proxy can then forward the HTTP message
to the intended IoT via CoAP.

URI mapping. The Universal Resource Identiﬁer (URI)
mapping technique is also described in [30]. This technique
involves a particular type of HTTP-CoAP cross proxy, the
reverse cross proxy. This proxy behaves as being the ﬁnal
web server to the HTTP/IPv4 client and as the original client
to the CoAP/IPv6 web server. Since this machine needs to
be placed in a part of the network where IPv6 connectivity is
present to allow direct access to the ﬁnal IoT nodes, IPv4/IPv6
conversion is internally resolved by the applied URI mapping
function.

B. Link Layer Technologies

An urban IoT system, due to its inherently large deployment
area, requires a set of link layer technologies that can easily
cover a wide geographical area and, at the same time, support a
possibly large amount of trafﬁc resulting from the aggregation
of an extremely high number of smaller data ﬂows. For these
reasons, link layer technologies enabling the realization of
an urban IoT system are classiﬁed into unconstrained and
constrained technologies. The ﬁrst group includes all the tra-
ditional LAN, MAN and WAN communication technologies,
such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ﬁber optic, broadband Power Line
Communication (PLC), and cellular technologies as such as
UMTS and LTE. They are generally characterized by high
reliability, low latency, and high transfer rates (order of Mbit/s
or higher), and due to their inherent complexity and energy
consumption are generally not suitable for peripheral IoT
nodes.

The constrained physical and link layer technologies are,
instead, generally characterized by low energy consump-
tion and relatively low transfer rates, typically smaller than
1 Mbit/s. The more prominent solutions in this category
are IEEE 802.15.4 [34], [35] Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low
Energy [36], IEEE 802.11 Low Power, Power Line Commu-
nication (PLC) [37], Near Field Communication (NFC) and
Radio Frequency Identiﬁer (RFID) [38]. These links usually
exhibit
long latencies, mainly due to two factors: (i) the
intrinsically low transmission rate at the physical layer, (ii)
the power saving policies implemented by the nodes to save

energy, which usually involve duty cycling with short active
periods.

C. Devices

We ﬁnally describe the devices that are essential to realize
an urban IoT, classiﬁed based on the position they occupy in
the communication ﬂow.

1) Backend servers: At the root of the system, we ﬁnd
the backend servers, located in the control center, where data
are collected, stored, and processed to produce added-value
services. In principle, backend servers are not mandatory
for an IoT system to properly operate, though they become
a fundamental component of an urban IoT where they can
facilitate the access to the smart city services and open data
through the legacy network infrastructure. Backend systems
commonly considered for interfacing with the IoT data feeders
include the following.

Database Management Systems. These systems are in charge
of storing the large amount of information produced by IoT
peripheral nodes, such as sensors. Depending on the particular
usage scenario, the load on these systems can be quite large,
so that proper dimensioning of the backend system is required.

Web Sites. The widespread acquaintance of people with web
interfaces makes them the ﬁrst option to enable interoperation
between the IoT system and the “data consumers,” e.g., public
authorities, service operators, utility providers, and common
citizens.

Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP). ERP compo-
nents support a variety of business functions and are precious
tools to manage the ﬂow of information across a complex
organization, such as a city administration. Interfacing ERP
components with database management systems that collect
the data generated by the IoT allows for a simpler management
of the potentially massive amount of data gathered by the IoT,
making it possible to separate the information ﬂows based
on their nature and relevance and easing the creation of new
services.

2) Gateways: Moving toward the “edge” of the IoT, we ﬁnd
the gateways, whose role is to interconnect the end devices to
the main communication infrastructure of the system. With
reference to the conceptual protocol architecture depicted in
Fig. 2, the gateway is hence required to provide protocol
translation and functional mapping between the unconstrained
protocols and their constrained counterparts, that is to say
XML-EXI, HTTP-CoAP, IPv4/v6-6LoWPAN.

Note that, while all these translations may be required in
order to enable interoperability with IoT peripheral devices
and control stations, it is not necessary to concentrate all of
them in a single gateway. Rather, it is possible, and sometimes
convenient, to distribute the translation tasks over different
devices in the network. For example, a single HTTP-CoAP
proxy can be deployed to support multiple 6LoWPAN border
routers.

Gateway devices shall also provide the interconnection
between unconstrained link layer technologies, mainly used
in the core of the IoT network, and constrained technologies

7

that, instead, provide connectivity among the IoT peripheral
nodes.

3) IoT peripheral nodes: Finally, at the periphery of the
IoT system we ﬁnd the devices in charge of producing the
data to be delivered to the control center, which are usually
called IoT peripheral nodes or, more simply, IoT nodes.
Generally speaking, the cost of these devices is very low,
starting from 10 USD or even less, depending on the kind and
number of sensors/actuators mounted on the board. IoT nodes
may be classiﬁed based on a wide number of characteristics,
such as powering mode, networking role (relay or leaf), sen-
sor/actuator equipment, supported link layer technologies. The
most constrained IoT nodes are likely the Radio Frequency
tags (RFtags) that, despite their very limited capabilities, can
still play an important role in IoT systems, mainly because
of the extremely low cost and the passive nature of their
communication hardware, which does not require any internal
energy source. The typical application of RFtags is object
identiﬁcation by proximity reading, which can be used for
logistics, maintenance, monitoring, and other services.

Mobile devices, such as smart phones,

tablet PCs, or
laptops, may also be an important part of an urban IoT,
providing other ways to interact with it. For instance, the Near-
Field-Communication (NFC) transceiver integrated in last-
generation smartphones may be used to identify tagged ob-
jects, while the geolocation service provided by most common
operating systems for mobile devices can enrich the context
information associated to that object. Furthermore, mobile
devices can provide access to the IoT in different ways, e.g.,
(i) through an IP connection provided by the cellular data-
link service, or (ii) setting up a direct connection with some
objects by using short-range wireless technologies, such as
Bluetooth Low Energy, low power WiFi, or IEEE 802.15.4.
Furthermore, it is possible to develop speciﬁc applications
for mobile devices that can ease the interaction with the IoT
objects, and with the system as a whole.

IV. AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: PADOVA SMART CITY
The framework discussed in this paper has already been
successfully applied to a number of different use cases in the
context of IoT systems. For instance, the experimental wireless
sensor network testbed, with more than 300 nodes, deployed
at the University of Padova [39], [40] has been designed
according to these guidelines, and successfully used to realize
proof-of-concept demonstrations of smart grid [41], and health
care [42] services.

In this section we describe a practical implementation of
an urban IoT, named “Padova Smart City,” that has been
realized in the city of Padova thanks to the collaboration
between public and private parties, such as the municipality of
Padova, which has sponsored the project, the Department of
Information Engineering of the University of Padova, which
has provided the theoretical background and the feasibility
analysis of the project, and Patavina Technologies s.r.l.,1

Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incor-
porate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different
and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of
digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is
hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large
variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may
be involved in such a system. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally to
an urban IoT systems that, while still being quite a broad category,
are characterized by their speciﬁc application domain. Urban
IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which
aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies
to support added-value services for the administration of the city
and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive
survey of the enabling technologies, protocols and architecture for
an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the
Padova Smart City project, a proof of concept deployment of an
IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration
with the city municipality.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE IoT is a recent communication paradigm that en-

visions a near future in which the objects of everyday
life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for
digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will
make them able to communicate with one another and with
the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

generated by such objects to provide new services to citi-
zens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm
indeed ﬁnds application in many different domains, such as
home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile
health care, elderly assistance, intelligent energy management
and smart grids, automotive, trafﬁc management and many
others [2].

However, such a heterogeneous ﬁeld of application makes
the identiﬁcation of solutions capable of satisfying the re-
quirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable
challenge. This difﬁculty has led to the proliferation of differ-
ent and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical
realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system per-
spective, the realization of an IoT network, together with the
required backend network services and devices, still lacks an
established best practice because of its novelty and complexity.
In addition to the technical difﬁculties, the adoption of the
IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and
widely accepted business model that can attract investments
to promote the deployment of these technologies [3].

the application of

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the
public administrations. This objective can be pursued by the
deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastruc-
ture that provides uniﬁed, simple, and economical access to a
plethora of public services, thus unleashing potential synergies
and increasing transparency to the citizens. An urban IoT,
indeed, may bring a number of beneﬁts in the management and
optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public
areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection,
salubrity of hospitals and school [5]. Furthermore, the avail-
ability of different types of data, collected by a pervasive
urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the transparency
and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of
their city, stimulate the active participation of the citizens in
the management of public administration, and also stimulate
the creation of new services upon those provided by the
IoT [6]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to
the Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional
administrations that may become the early adopters of such
technologies, thus acting as catalyzers for the adoption of the

IoT paradigm on a wider scale.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

penetration of ICT solutions in this domain, however, may
result in signiﬁcant savings and economical and ecological
advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste contain-
ers that detect the level of load and allow for an optimization
of the collector trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste
collection and improve the quality of recycling [14], [15]. To
realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT shall
connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to
a control center where an optimization software processes the
data and determines the optimal management of the collector
truck ﬂeet.
Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc
hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring service
to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour
in the places that adopt the service [18]. Besides building
a space-time map of the noise pollution in the area, such
a service can also be used to enforce public security, by
means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for

instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service
can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and
the conﬁdence of public establishment owners, although the
installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power
widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Trafﬁc monitoring may be realized by using the
sensing capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles
[19], but also adopting a combination of air quality and
acoustic sensors along a given road. This information is of
great
importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline trafﬁc and to send ofﬁcers where needed,
for the latter to plan in advance the route to reach the ofﬁce
or to better schedule a shopping trip to the city centre.
City energy consumption. Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this
will make it possible to identify the main energy consumption
sources and to set priorities in order to optimize their behavior.
This goes in the direction indicated by the European directive
for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must
be integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it
will also be possible to enhance these service with active

III. URBAN IOT ARCHITECTURE

From the analysis of the services described in Sec. II, it
clearly emerges that most Smart City services are based on a
centralized architecture, where a dense and heterogeneous set
of peripheral devices deployed over the urban area generate
different types of data that are then delivered through suitable
communication technologies to a control center, where data
storage and processing are performed.

A primary characteristic of an urban IoT infrastructure,
hence, is its capability of integrating different technologies
with the existing communication infrastructures in order to
support a progressive evolution of the IoT, with the in-
terconnection of other devices and the realization of novel
functionalities and services. Another fundamental aspect is the
necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT
easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the
responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and promote the
awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters
[11].

In the rest of this section we describe the different compo-
nents of an urban IoT system, as sketched in Fig. 1. We start
describing the web service approach for the design of IoT
services, which requires the deployment of suitable protocol
layers in the different elements of the network, as shown in
the protocol stacks depicted in Fig. 1 besides the key elements
of the architecture. Then, we brieﬂy overview the link layer
technologies that can be used to interconnect the different
parts of the IoT. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous set
of devices that concur to the realization of an urban IoT.

A. Web service approach for IoT service architecture

Although in the IoT many different standards are still
struggling to be the reference one and the most adopted, in this
section we focus speciﬁcally on IETF standards because they
are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices,
and can count on a wide community.

The IETF standards for IoT embrace a web service archi-
tecture for IoT services, which has been widely documented
in the literature as a very promising and ﬂexible approach. In
fact, web services permit to realize a ﬂexible and interoperable
system that can be extended to IoT nodes, through the adoption
of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State
Transfer (ReST) [22]. IoT services designed in accordance
with the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with
traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption
and use of IoT by both end users and service developers,
which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge
gained from traditional web technologies in the development
of services for networks containing smart objects. The web
service approach is also promoted by international standard-
ization bodies such as IETF, ETSI and W3C, among others, as
well as European research projects on the Internet of Things
such as SENSEI [23], IoT-A [24] and SmartSantander [5].

Fig. 2 shows a reference protocol architecture for the
urban IoT system that entails both an unconstrained and a
constrained protocol stack. The ﬁrst consists of the protocols

service approach.

sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the
best path for parking in the city [20]. The beneﬁts deriving
from this service are manifold: faster time to locate a parking
slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
less trafﬁc
congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service
can be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure,
because many companies in Europe are providing market
products for this application. Furthermore, by using short-
range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identiﬁers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is
possible to realize an electronic veriﬁcation system of parking
permits in slots reserved for residents or disabled, thus offering
a better service to citizens that can legitimately use those slots
and an efﬁcient tool for quickly spot violations.

Smart lighting. In order to support the 202020 directive, the
optimization of the street lighting efﬁciency is an important
feature. In particular,
this service can optimize the street
lamp intensity according to the time of the day, the weather
conditions and the presence of people. In order to properly
work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit
the increased number of connected spots to provide WiFi
connection to citizens. In addition, a fault detection system
will be easily realized on top of the street light controllers.

Automation and salubrity of public buildings. Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of
the energy consumption and the salubrity of the environment
in public buildings (schools, administration ofﬁces, museums)
by means of different types of sensors and actuators that
control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters,
is possible to enhance the level of
comfort of the persons that live in these environments, which
may also have a positive return in terms of productivity, while
reducing the costs for heating/cooling [21].

EXI processors share an XML Schema before actual encoding
and decoding can take place. This shared schema makes it
possible to assign numeric identiﬁers to the XML tags in the
schema and build the EXI grammars upon such coding. As
discussed in [27], a general purpose schema-informed EXI
processor can be easily integrated even in very constrained
devices, enabling them to interpret EXI formats and, hence,
making it possible to build multi-purpose IoT nodes even
out of very constrained devices. Using the schema-informed
approach, however, requires additional care in the development
of higher layer application, since developers need to deﬁne an
XML Schema for the messages involved in the application and
use EXI processors that support this operating mode. Further
details about EXI and schema-informed processing can be
found in [27].

Integration of multiple XML/EXI data sources into an IoT
system can be obtained by using the databases typically
created and maintained by high-level applications. In fact, IoT
applications generally build a database of the nodes controlled
by the application and, often, of the data generated by such
nodes. The database makes it possible to integrate the data
received by any IoT device to provide the speciﬁc service
the application is built for. A generic framework for building
IoT web applications according to the guidelines described
in this section has been proposed in [28], where the authors
also suggest exploiting the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
(AJAX) capabilities of modern web browsers that allow for a
direct communication between the browser and the ﬁnal IoT
node, demonstrating the full internetworking of the protocol
stack and the open data nature of the proposed approach.

2) Application and transport layers: Most of the trafﬁc that
crosses the Internet today is carried at the application layer by
HTTP over TCP. However, the verbosity and complexity of
native HTTP make it unsuitable for a straight deployment on
constrained IoT devices. For such an environment, in fact, the
human-readable format of HTTP, which has been one of the
reasons of its success in traditional networks, turns out to be
a limiting factor due to the large amount of heavily correlated
(and, hence, redundant) data. Moreover, HTTP typically relies
upon the TCP transport protocol that, however, does not scale
well on constrained devices, yielding poor performance for
small data ﬂows in lossy environments.

The CoAP protocol [29] overcomes these difﬁculties by
proposing a binary format transported over UDP, handling
only the retransmissions strictly required to provide a reliable
service. Moreover, CoAP can easily interoperate with HTTP
because: (i) it supports the ReST methods of HTTP (GET,
PUT, POST, and DELETE), (ii) there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the response codes of the two protocols,
and (iii) the CoAP options can support a wide range of HTTP
usage scenarios.

Even though regular Internet hosts can natively support
CoAP to directly talk to IoT devices, the most general and
easily interoperable solution requires the deployment of an
HTTP-CoAP intermediary, also known as cross proxy, that
can straightforwardly translate requests/responses between the
two protocols, thus enabling transparent interoperation with
native HTTP devices and applications [30].

nodes.

Protocol stacks for unconstrained (left) and constrained (right) IoT

that are currently the de-facto standards for Internet communi-
cations, and are commonly used by regular Internet hosts, such
as XML, HTTP, and IPv4. These protocols are mirrored in
the constrained protocol stack by their low-complexity coun-
terparts, i.e., the Efﬁcient XML Interchange (EXI), the Con-
strained Application Protocol (CoAP), and 6LoWPAN, which
are suitable even for very constrained devices. The transcoding
operations between the protocols in the left and right stacks
in Fig. 2 can be performed in a standard and low complexity
manner, thus guaranteeing easy access and interoperability of
the IoT nodes with the Internet. It may be worth remarking that
systems that do not adopt the EXI/CoAP/6LoWPAN protocol
stack can still be seamlessly included in the urban IoT system,
provided that they are capable of interfacing with all the layers
of the left-hand side of the protocol architecture in Fig. 2.

In the protocol architecture shown in Fig. 2 we can dis-
tinguish three distinct functional layers, namely (i) Data, (ii)
Application/Transport, and (iii) Network,
that may require
dedicated entities to operate the transcoding between con-
strained and unconstrained formats and protocols. In the rest
of this section, we specify in greater detail the requirements
at each of the three functional layers in order to guarantee
interoperability among the different parts of the system.

1) Data format: As mentioned, the urban IoT paradigm
sets speciﬁc requirements in terms of data accessibility. In
architectures based on web services, data exchange is typically
accompanied by a description of the transferred content by
means of semantic representation languages, of which the
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is probably the most
common. Nevertheless, the size of XML messages is often too
large for the limited capacity of typical devices for the IoT.
Furthermore, the text nature of XML representation makes the
parsing of messages by CPU-limited devices more complex
compared to the binary formats. For these reasons, the working
group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [25] has
proposed the EXI format [26], which makes it possible even
for very constrained devices to natively support and generate
messages using an open data format compatible with XML.
EXI deﬁnes two types of encoding, namely schema-less
and schema-informed. While the schema-less encoding is
generated directly from the XML data and can be decoded
by any EXI entity without any prior knowledge about the
data, the schema-informed encoding assumes that the two

ogy supported by Internet hosts. However, IANA, the interna-
tional organization that assigns IP addresses at a global level,
has recently announced the exhaustion of IPv4 address blocks.
IoT networks, in turn, are expected to include billions of nodes,
each of which shall be (in principle) uniquely addressable. A
solution to this problem is offered by the IPv6 standard [31],
which provides a 128-bit address ﬁeld, thus making it possible
to assign a unique IPv6 address to any possible node in the
IoT network.

While, on the one hand, the huge address space of IPv6
makes it possible to solve the addressing issues in IoT, on
the other hand it introduces overheads that are not compat-
ible with the scarce capabilities of constrained nodes. This
problem can be overcome by adopting 6LoWPAN [32] [33],
which is an established compression format for IPv6 and
UDP headers over low-power constrained networks. A border
router, that is a device directly attached to the 6LoWPAN net-
work, transparently performs the conversion between IPv6 and
6LoWPAN, translating any IPv6 packet intended for a node in
the 6LoWPAN network into a packet with 6LoWPAN header
compression format, and operating the inverse translation in
the opposite direction.

While the deployment of a 6LoWPAN border router enables
transparent interaction between IoT nodes and any IPv6 host
in the Internet, the interaction with IPv4-only hosts remains
an issue. More speciﬁcally, the problem consists in ﬁnding a
way to address a speciﬁc IPv6 host using an IPv4 address and
other meta-data available in the packet. In the following we
present different approaches to achieve this goal.

v4/v6 Port Address Translation (v4/v6 PAT). This method
maps arbitrary pairs of IPv4 addresses and TCP/UDP ports
into IPv6 addresses and TCP/UDP ports. It resembles the clas-
sical Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) service
currently supported in many LANs to provide Internet access
to a number of hosts in a private network by sharing a common
public IPv4 address, which is used to address the packets
over the public Internet. When a packet is returned to the
IPv4 common address, the edge router that supports the NATP
service will intercept the packet and replace the common IPv4
destination address with the (private) address of the intended
receiver, which is determined by looking up in the NATP table
the address of the host associated to the speciﬁc destination
port carried by the packet. The same technique can be used
to map multiple IPv6 addresses into a single IPv4 public
address, which allows the forwarding of the datagrams in the
IPv4 network and its correct management at IPv4-only hosts.
The application of this technique requires low complexity
and, indeed, port mapping is an established technique for
v4/v6 transition. On the other hand, this approach raises a
scalability problem, since the number of IPv6 hosts that can
be multiplexed into a single IPv4 address is limited by the
number of available TCP/UDP ports (65535). Furthermore,
this approach requires that the connection be initiated by the
IPv6 nodes in order to create the correct entries in the NATP
look up table. Connections starting from the IPv4 cloud can
also be realized, but this requires a more complex architecture,
with the local DNS placed within the IPv6 network and

6

statically associated to a public IPv4 address in the NATP
translation table.

v4/v6 Domain Name Conversion. This method, originally
proposed in [30], is similar to the technique used to provide
virtual hosting service in HTTP 1.1, which makes it possible to
support multiple websites on the same web server, sharing the
same IPv4 address, by exploiting the information contained
in the HTTP Host header to identify the speciﬁc web site
requested by the user. Similarly, it is possible to program the
DNS servers in such a way that, upon a DNS request for
the domain name of an IoT web service, the DNS returns the
IPv4 address of an HTTP-CoAP cross proxy to be contacted to
access the IoT node. Once addressed by an HTTP request, the
proxy requires the resolution of the domain name contained in
the HTTP Host header to the IPv6 DNS server, which replies
with the IPv6 address that identiﬁes the ﬁnal IoT node involved
in the request. The proxy can then forward the HTTP message
to the intended IoT via CoAP.

URI mapping. The Universal Resource Identiﬁer (URI)
mapping technique is also described in [30]. This technique
involves a particular type of HTTP-CoAP cross proxy, the
reverse cross proxy. This proxy behaves as being the ﬁnal
web server to the HTTP/IPv4 client and as the original client
to the CoAP/IPv6 web server. Since this machine needs to
be placed in a part of the network where IPv6 connectivity is
present to allow direct access to the ﬁnal IoT nodes, IPv4/IPv6
conversion is internally resolved by the applied URI mapping
function.

B. Link Layer Technologies

An urban IoT system, due to its inherently large deployment
area, requires a set of link layer technologies that can easily
cover a wide geographical area and, at the same time, support a
possibly large amount of trafﬁc resulting from the aggregation
of an extremely high number of smaller data ﬂows. For these
reasons, link layer technologies enabling the realization of
an urban IoT system are classiﬁed into unconstrained and
constrained technologies. The ﬁrst group includes all the tra-
ditional LAN, MAN and WAN communication technologies,
such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ﬁber optic, broadband Power Line
Communication (PLC), and cellular technologies as such as
UMTS and LTE. They are generally characterized by high
reliability, low latency, and high transfer rates (order of Mbit/s
or higher), and due to their inherent complexity and energy
consumption are generally not suitable for peripheral IoT
nodes.

The constrained physical and link layer technologies are,
instead, generally characterized by low energy consump-
tion and relatively low transfer rates, typically smaller than
1 Mbit/s. The more prominent solutions in this category
are IEEE 802.15.4 [34], [35] Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low
Energy [36], IEEE 802.11 Low Power, Power Line Commu-
nication (PLC) [37], Near Field Communication (NFC) and
Radio Frequency Identiﬁer (RFID) [38]. These links usually
exhibit
long latencies, mainly due to two factors: (i) the
intrinsically low transmission rate at the physical layer, (ii)
the power saving policies implemented by the nodes to save

energy, which usually involve duty cycling with short active
periods.

C. Devices

We ﬁnally describe the devices that are essential to realize
an urban IoT, classiﬁed based on the position they occupy in
the communication ﬂow.

1) Backend servers: At the root of the system, we ﬁnd
the backend servers, located in the control center, where data
are collected, stored, and processed to produce added-value
services. In principle, backend servers are not mandatory
for an IoT system to properly operate, though they become
a fundamental component of an urban IoT where they can
facilitate the access to the smart city services and open data
through the legacy network infrastructure. Backend systems
commonly considered for interfacing with the IoT data feeders
include the following.

Database Management Systems. These systems are in charge
of storing the large amount of information produced by IoT
peripheral nodes, such as sensors. Depending on the particular
usage scenario, the load on these systems can be quite large,
so that proper dimensioning of the backend system is required.

Web Sites. The widespread acquaintance of people with web
interfaces makes them the ﬁrst option to enable interoperation
between the IoT system and the “data consumers,” e.g., public
authorities, service operators, utility providers, and common
citizens.

Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP). ERP compo-
nents support a variety of business functions and are precious
tools to manage the ﬂow of information across a complex
organization, such as a city administration. Interfacing ERP
components with database management systems that collect
the data generated by the IoT allows for a simpler management
of the potentially massive amount of data gathered by the IoT,
making it possible to separate the information ﬂows based
on their nature and relevance and easing the creation of new
services.

2) Gateways: Moving toward the “edge” of the IoT, we ﬁnd
the gateways, whose role is to interconnect the end devices to
the main communication infrastructure of the system. With
reference to the conceptual protocol architecture depicted in
Fig. 2, the gateway is hence required to provide protocol
translation and functional mapping between the unconstrained
protocols and their constrained counterparts, that is to say
XML-EXI, HTTP-CoAP, IPv4/v6-6LoWPAN.

Note that, while all these translations may be required in
order to enable interoperability with IoT peripheral devices
and control stations, it is not necessary to concentrate all of
them in a single gateway. Rather, it is possible, and sometimes
convenient, to distribute the translation tasks over different
devices in the network. For example, a single HTTP-CoAP
proxy can be deployed to support multiple 6LoWPAN border
routers.

Gateway devices shall also provide the interconnection
between unconstrained link layer technologies, mainly used
in the core of the IoT network, and constrained technologies

7

that, instead, provide connectivity among the IoT peripheral
nodes.

3) IoT peripheral nodes: Finally, at the periphery of the
IoT system we ﬁnd the devices in charge of producing the
data to be delivered to the control center, which are usually
called IoT peripheral nodes or, more simply, IoT nodes.
Generally speaking, the cost of these devices is very low,
starting from 10 USD or even less, depending on the kind and
number of sensors/actuators mounted on the board. IoT nodes
may be classiﬁed based on a wide number of characteristics,
such as powering mode, networking role (relay or leaf), sen-
sor/actuator equipment, supported link layer technologies. The
most constrained IoT nodes are likely the Radio Frequency
tags (RFtags) that, despite their very limited capabilities, can
still play an important role in IoT systems, mainly because
of the extremely low cost and the passive nature of their
communication hardware, which does not require any internal
energy source. The typical application of RFtags is object
identiﬁcation by proximity reading, which can be used for
logistics, maintenance, monitoring, and other services.

Mobile devices, such as smart phones,

tablet PCs, or
laptops, may also be an important part of an urban IoT,
providing other ways to interact with it. For instance, the Near-
Field-Communication (NFC) transceiver integrated in last-
generation smartphones may be used to identify tagged ob-
jects, while the geolocation service provided by most common
operating systems for mobile devices can enrich the context
information associated to that object. Furthermore, mobile
devices can provide access to the IoT in different ways, e.g.,
(i) through an IP connection provided by the cellular data-
link service, or (ii) setting up a direct connection with some
objects by using short-range wireless technologies, such as
Bluetooth Low Energy, low power WiFi, or IEEE 802.15.4.
Furthermore, it is possible to develop speciﬁc applications
for mobile devices that can ease the interaction with the IoT
objects, and with the system as a whole.

IV. AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: PADOVA SMART CITY
The framework discussed in this paper has already been
successfully applied to a number of different use cases in the
context of IoT systems. For instance, the experimental wireless
sensor network testbed, with more than 300 nodes, deployed
at the University of Padova [39], [40] has been designed
according to these guidelines, and successfully used to realize
proof-of-concept demonstrations of smart grid [41], and health
care [42] services.

In this section we describe a practical implementation of
an urban IoT, named “Padova Smart City,” that has been
realized in the city of Padova thanks to the collaboration
between public and private parties, such as the municipality of
Padova, which has sponsored the project, the Department of
Information Engineering of the University of Padova, which
has provided the theoretical background and the feasibility
analysis of the project, and Patavina Technologies s.r.l.,1
a spin-off of the University of Padova specialized in the

development of innovative IoT solutions, which has developed
the IoT nodes and the control software.

The primary goal of Padova Smart City is to promote the
early adoption of open data and ICT solutions in the public
administration. The target application consists of a system for
collecting environmental data and monitoring the public street
lighting by means of wireless nodes, equipped with different
kinds of sensors, placed on street light poles and connected to
the Internet through a gateway unit. This system shall make it
possible to collect interesting environmental parameters, such
as CO level, air temperature and humidity, vibrations, noise,
and so on, while providing a simple but accurate mechanism
to check the correct operation of the public lighting system by
measuring the light intensity at each post. Even if this system
is a simple application of the IoT concept, it still involves a
number of different devices and link layer technologies, thus
being representative of most of the critical issues that need to
be taken care of when designing an urban IoT. A high-level
overview of the types and roles of the devices involved in the
system is given hereafter.

Padova Smart City components. A conceptual sketch of the
Padova Smart City system architecture is given in Fig. 3. In the
following, we describe in more details the different hardware
and software components of the system.

Street light. It is the leaf part of the system where IoT
nodes are placed. Each streetlight is geographically localized
on the city map and uniquely associated to the IoT node
attached to it, so that IoT data can be enhanced with context
information. The monitoring of the correct operation of the
bulbs is performed through photometer sensors that directly
measure the intensity of the light emitted by the lamps (or,
actually, by any source whose light reaches the sensor) at
regular time intervals or upon request. The wireless IoT nodes
are also equipped with temperature and humidity sensors,
which provide data concerning weather conditions, and one
node is also equipped with a benzene (C6H6) sensor, which
monitors air quality. IoT nodes are generally powered by small
batteries, though connection to a low power grid is required

by the benzene sensor. The packaging of the sensor nodes has
been designed by taking into account the speciﬁc requirements
of this use case. Indeed, sensor nodes have been hosted in a
transparent plastic shield that protects the electronic parts from
atmospheric phenomena (like rain or snow), while permitting
the circulation of air and light for the correct measurement of
humidity, temperature, and light intensity.

Constrained link layer technologies. The IoT nodes mounted
on the streetlight poles form a 6LoWPAN multi-hop cloud,
using IEEE 802.15.4 constrained link layer technology. Rout-
ing functionalities are provided by the IPv6 Routing Proto-
col for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [43]. IoT
nodes are assigned unique IPv6 addresses, suitably compressed
according to the 6LoWPAN standard. Each node can be
individually accessible from anywhere in the Internet by means
of IPv6/6LoWPAN. Nodes collectively deliver their data to a
sink node, which represents the single point of contact for
the external nodes. Alternatively, each node might publish
its own features and data by running a CoAP server, though
this feature is not yet implemented in the testbed. In either
case, a gateway is required to bridge the 6LoWPAN cloud to
the Internet and perform all the transcoding described in the
previous section.

WSN Gateway. The gateway has the role of interfacing
the constrained link layer technology used in the sensors
cloud with traditional WAN technologies used to provide
connectivity to the central backend servers. The gateway hence
plays the role of 6LoWPAN border router and RPL root
node. Furthermore, since sensor nodes do not support CoAP
services, the gateway also operates as the sink node for the
sensor cloud, collecting all the data that need to be exported
to the backend services. The connection to the backend ser-
vices is provided by common unconstrained communication
technologies, optical ﬁber in this speciﬁc example.

HTTP-CoAP Proxy. The HTTP-CoAP proxy enables trans-
parent communication with CoAP devices. The proxy logic
can be extended to better support monitoring applications and
limit the amount of trafﬁc injected into the IoT peripheral
is possible to specify a list of
network. For instance,

Internet of Things for Smart Cities

Lorenzo Vangelista, Senior Member, IEEE, Michele Zorzi, Fellow, IEEE

Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incor-
porate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different
and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of
digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is
hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large
variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may
be involved in such a system. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally to
an urban IoT systems that, while still being quite a broad category,
are characterized by their speciﬁc application domain. Urban
IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which
aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies
to support added-value services for the administration of the city
and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive
survey of the enabling technologies, protocols and architecture for
an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the
Padova Smart City project, a proof of concept deployment of an
IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration
with the city municipality.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE IoT is a recent communication paradigm that en-

visions a near future in which the objects of everyday
life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for
digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will
make them able to communicate with one another and with
the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

indeed ﬁnds application in many different domains, such as
home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile

others [2].

However, such a heterogeneous ﬁeld of application makes
the identiﬁcation of solutions capable of satisfying the re-
quirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable
challenge. This difﬁculty has led to the proliferation of differ-
ent and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical
realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system per-
spective, the realization of an IoT network, together with the
required backend network services and devices, still lacks an
established best practice because of its novelty and complexity.
In addition to the technical difﬁculties, the adoption of the
IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and
widely accepted business model that can attract investments
to promote the deployment of these technologies [3].

the application of

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the
public administrations. This objective can be pursued by the
deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastruc-
ture that provides uniﬁed, simple, and economical access to a
plethora of public services, thus unleashing potential synergies
and increasing transparency to the citizens. An urban IoT,
indeed, may bring a number of beneﬁts in the management and
optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public
areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection,
salubrity of hospitals and school [5]. Furthermore, the avail-
ability of different types of data, collected by a pervasive
urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the transparency
and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of
their city, stimulate the active participation of the citizens in
the management of public administration, and also stimulate
the creation of new services upon those provided by the
IoT [6]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to
the Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional
administrations that may become the early adopters of such
technologies, thus acting as catalyzers for the adoption of the

IoT paradigm on a wider scale.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

penetration of ICT solutions in this domain, however, may
result in signiﬁcant savings and economical and ecological
advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste contain-
ers that detect the level of load and allow for an optimization
of the collector trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste
collection and improve the quality of recycling [14], [15]. To
realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT shall
connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to
a control center where an optimization software processes the
data and determines the optimal management of the collector
truck ﬂeet.
Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc
hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring service
to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour
in the places that adopt the service [18]. Besides building
a space-time map of the noise pollution in the area, such
a service can also be used to enforce public security, by
means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for

instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service
can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and
the conﬁdence of public establishment owners, although the
installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power
widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Trafﬁc monitoring may be realized by using the
sensing capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles
[19], but also adopting a combination of air quality and
acoustic sensors along a given road. This information is of
great
importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline trafﬁc and to send ofﬁcers where needed,
for the latter to plan in advance the route to reach the ofﬁce
or to better schedule a shopping trip to the city centre.
City energy consumption. Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this
will make it possible to identify the main energy consumption
sources and to set priorities in order to optimize their behavior.
This goes in the direction indicated by the European directive
for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must
be integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it
will also be possible to enhance these service with active
functionalities to control local power production structures
(e.g., photovoltaic panels).

Smart parking. The smart parking service is based on road

III. URBAN IOT ARCHITECTURE

From the analysis of the services described in Sec. II, it
clearly emerges that most Smart City services are based on a
centralized architecture, where a dense and heterogeneous set
of peripheral devices deployed over the urban area generate
different types of data that are then delivered through suitable
communication technologies to a control center, where data
storage and processing are performed.

A primary characteristic of an urban IoT infrastructure,
hence, is its capability of integrating different technologies
with the existing communication infrastructures in order to
support a progressive evolution of the IoT, with the in-
terconnection of other devices and the realization of novel
functionalities and services. Another fundamental aspect is the
necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT
easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the
responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and promote the
awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters
[11].

In the rest of this section we describe the different compo-
nents of an urban IoT system, as sketched in Fig. 1. We start
describing the web service approach for the design of IoT
services, which requires the deployment of suitable protocol
layers in the different elements of the network, as shown in
the protocol stacks depicted in Fig. 1 besides the key elements
of the architecture. Then, we brieﬂy overview the link layer
technologies that can be used to interconnect the different
parts of the IoT. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous set
of devices that concur to the realization of an urban IoT.

A. Web service approach for IoT service architecture

Although in the IoT many different standards are still
struggling to be the reference one and the most adopted, in this
section we focus speciﬁcally on IETF standards because they
are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices,
and can count on a wide community.

The IETF standards for IoT embrace a web service archi-
tecture for IoT services, which has been widely documented
in the literature as a very promising and ﬂexible approach. In
fact, web services permit to realize a ﬂexible and interoperable
system that can be extended to IoT nodes, through the adoption
of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State
Transfer (ReST) [22]. IoT services designed in accordance
with the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with
traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption
and use of IoT by both end users and service developers,
which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge
gained from traditional web technologies in the development
of services for networks containing smart objects. The web
service approach is also promoted by international standard-
ization bodies such as IETF, ETSI and W3C, among others, as
well as European research projects on the Internet of Things
such as SENSEI [23], IoT-A [24] and SmartSantander [5].

Fig. 2 shows a reference protocol architecture for the
urban IoT system that entails both an unconstrained and a
constrained protocol stack. The ﬁrst consists of the protocols

service approach.

sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the
best path for parking in the city [20]. The beneﬁts deriving
from this service are manifold: faster time to locate a parking
slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
less trafﬁc
congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service
can be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure,
because many companies in Europe are providing market
products for this application. Furthermore, by using short-
range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identiﬁers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is
possible to realize an electronic veriﬁcation system of parking
permits in slots reserved for residents or disabled, thus offering
a better service to citizens that can legitimately use those slots
and an efﬁcient tool for quickly spot violations.

Smart lighting. In order to support the 202020 directive, the
optimization of the street lighting efﬁciency is an important
feature. In particular,
this service can optimize the street
lamp intensity according to the time of the day, the weather
conditions and the presence of people. In order to properly
work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit
the increased number of connected spots to provide WiFi
connection to citizens. In addition, a fault detection system
will be easily realized on top of the street light controllers.

Automation and salubrity of public buildings. Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of
the energy consumption and the salubrity of the environment
in public buildings (schools, administration ofﬁces, museums)
by means of different types of sensors and actuators that
control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters,
is possible to enhance the level of
comfort of the persons that live in these environments, which
may also have a positive return in terms of productivity, while
reducing the costs for heating/cooling [21].

EXI processors share an XML Schema before actual encoding
and decoding can take place. This shared schema makes it
possible to assign numeric identiﬁers to the XML tags in the
schema and build the EXI grammars upon such coding. As
discussed in [27], a general purpose schema-informed EXI
processor can be easily integrated even in very constrained
devices, enabling them to interpret EXI formats and, hence,
making it possible to build multi-purpose IoT nodes even
out of very constrained devices. Using the schema-informed
approach, however, requires additional care in the development
of higher layer application, since developers need to deﬁne an
XML Schema for the messages involved in the application and
use EXI processors that support this operating mode. Further
details about EXI and schema-informed processing can be
found in [27].

Integration of multiple XML/EXI data sources into an IoT
system can be obtained by using the databases typically
created and maintained by high-level applications. In fact, IoT
applications generally build a database of the nodes controlled
by the application and, often, of the data generated by such
nodes. The database makes it possible to integrate the data
received by any IoT device to provide the speciﬁc service
the application is built for. A generic framework for building
IoT web applications according to the guidelines described
in this section has been proposed in [28], where the authors
also suggest exploiting the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
(AJAX) capabilities of modern web browsers that allow for a
direct communication between the browser and the ﬁnal IoT
node, demonstrating the full internetworking of the protocol
stack and the open data nature of the proposed approach.

2) Application and transport layers: Most of the trafﬁc that
crosses the Internet today is carried at the application layer by
HTTP over TCP. However, the verbosity and complexity of
native HTTP make it unsuitable for a straight deployment on
constrained IoT devices. For such an environment, in fact, the
human-readable format of HTTP, which has been one of the
reasons of its success in traditional networks, turns out to be
a limiting factor due to the large amount of heavily correlated
(and, hence, redundant) data. Moreover, HTTP typically relies
upon the TCP transport protocol that, however, does not scale
well on constrained devices, yielding poor performance for
small data ﬂows in lossy environments.

The CoAP protocol [29] overcomes these difﬁculties by
proposing a binary format transported over UDP, handling
only the retransmissions strictly required to provide a reliable
service. Moreover, CoAP can easily interoperate with HTTP
because: (i) it supports the ReST methods of HTTP (GET,
PUT, POST, and DELETE), (ii) there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the response codes of the two protocols,
and (iii) the CoAP options can support a wide range of HTTP
usage scenarios.

Even though regular Internet hosts can natively support
CoAP to directly talk to IoT devices, the most general and
easily interoperable solution requires the deployment of an
HTTP-CoAP intermediary, also known as cross proxy, that
can straightforwardly translate requests/responses between the
two protocols, thus enabling transparent interoperation with
native HTTP devices and applications [30].

nodes.

Protocol stacks for unconstrained (left) and constrained (right) IoT

that are currently the de-facto standards for Internet communi-
cations, and are commonly used by regular Internet hosts, such
as XML, HTTP, and IPv4. These protocols are mirrored in
the constrained protocol stack by their low-complexity coun-
terparts, i.e., the Efﬁcient XML Interchange (EXI), the Con-
strained Application Protocol (CoAP), and 6LoWPAN, which
are suitable even for very constrained devices. The transcoding
operations between the protocols in the left and right stacks
in Fig. 2 can be performed in a standard and low complexity
manner, thus guaranteeing easy access and interoperability of
the IoT nodes with the Internet. It may be worth remarking that
systems that do not adopt the EXI/CoAP/6LoWPAN protocol
stack can still be seamlessly included in the urban IoT system,
provided that they are capable of interfacing with all the layers
of the left-hand side of the protocol architecture in Fig. 2.

In the protocol architecture shown in Fig. 2 we can dis-
tinguish three distinct functional layers, namely (i) Data, (ii)
Application/Transport, and (iii) Network,
that may require
dedicated entities to operate the transcoding between con-
strained and unconstrained formats and protocols. In the rest
of this section, we specify in greater detail the requirements
at each of the three functional layers in order to guarantee
interoperability among the different parts of the system.

1) Data format: As mentioned, the urban IoT paradigm
sets speciﬁc requirements in terms of data accessibility. In
architectures based on web services, data exchange is typically
accompanied by a description of the transferred content by
means of semantic representation languages, of which the
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is probably the most
common. Nevertheless, the size of XML messages is often too
large for the limited capacity of typical devices for the IoT.
Furthermore, the text nature of XML representation makes the
parsing of messages by CPU-limited devices more complex
compared to the binary formats. For these reasons, the working
group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [25] has
proposed the EXI format [26], which makes it possible even
for very constrained devices to natively support and generate
messages using an open data format compatible with XML.
EXI deﬁnes two types of encoding, namely schema-less
and schema-informed. While the schema-less encoding is
generated directly from the XML data and can be decoded
by any EXI entity without any prior knowledge about the
data, the schema-informed encoding assumes that the two

ogy supported by Internet hosts. However, IANA, the interna-
tional organization that assigns IP addresses at a global level,
has recently announced the exhaustion of IPv4 address blocks.
IoT networks, in turn, are expected to include billions of nodes,
each of which shall be (in principle) uniquely addressable. A
solution to this problem is offered by the IPv6 standard [31],
which provides a 128-bit address ﬁeld, thus making it possible
to assign a unique IPv6 address to any possible node in the
IoT network.

While, on the one hand, the huge address space of IPv6
makes it possible to solve the addressing issues in IoT, on
the other hand it introduces overheads that are not compat-
ible with the scarce capabilities of constrained nodes. This
problem can be overcome by adopting 6LoWPAN [32] [33],
which is an established compression format for IPv6 and
UDP headers over low-power constrained networks. A border
router, that is a device directly attached to the 6LoWPAN net-
work, transparently performs the conversion between IPv6 and
6LoWPAN, translating any IPv6 packet intended for a node in
the 6LoWPAN network into a packet with 6LoWPAN header
compression format, and operating the inverse translation in
the opposite direction.

While the deployment of a 6LoWPAN border router enables
transparent interaction between IoT nodes and any IPv6 host
in the Internet, the interaction with IPv4-only hosts remains
an issue. More speciﬁcally, the problem consists in ﬁnding a
way to address a speciﬁc IPv6 host using an IPv4 address and
other meta-data available in the packet. In the following we
present different approaches to achieve this goal.

v4/v6 Port Address Translation (v4/v6 PAT). This method
maps arbitrary pairs of IPv4 addresses and TCP/UDP ports
into IPv6 addresses and TCP/UDP ports. It resembles the clas-
sical Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) service
currently supported in many LANs to provide Internet access
to a number of hosts in a private network by sharing a common
public IPv4 address, which is used to address the packets
over the public Internet. When a packet is returned to the
IPv4 common address, the edge router that supports the NATP
service will intercept the packet and replace the common IPv4
destination address with the (private) address of the intended
receiver, which is determined by looking up in the NATP table
the address of the host associated to the speciﬁc destination
port carried by the packet. The same technique can be used
to map multiple IPv6 addresses into a single IPv4 public
address, which allows the forwarding of the datagrams in the
IPv4 network and its correct management at IPv4-only hosts.
The application of this technique requires low complexity
and, indeed, port mapping is an established technique for
v4/v6 transition. On the other hand, this approach raises a
scalability problem, since the number of IPv6 hosts that can
be multiplexed into a single IPv4 address is limited by the
number of available TCP/UDP ports (65535). Furthermore,
this approach requires that the connection be initiated by the
IPv6 nodes in order to create the correct entries in the NATP
look up table. Connections starting from the IPv4 cloud can
also be realized, but this requires a more complex architecture,
with the local DNS placed within the IPv6 network and

6

statically associated to a public IPv4 address in the NATP
translation table.

v4/v6 Domain Name Conversion. This method, originally
proposed in [30], is similar to the technique used to provide
virtual hosting service in HTTP 1.1, which makes it possible to
support multiple websites on the same web server, sharing the
same IPv4 address, by exploiting the information contained
in the HTTP Host header to identify the speciﬁc web site
requested by the user. Similarly, it is possible to program the
DNS servers in such a way that, upon a DNS request for
the domain name of an IoT web service, the DNS returns the
IPv4 address of an HTTP-CoAP cross proxy to be contacted to
access the IoT node. Once addressed by an HTTP request, the
proxy requires the resolution of the domain name contained in
the HTTP Host header to the IPv6 DNS server, which replies
with the IPv6 address that identiﬁes the ﬁnal IoT node involved
in the request. The proxy can then forward the HTTP message
to the intended IoT via CoAP.

URI mapping. The Universal Resource Identiﬁer (URI)
mapping technique is also described in [30]. This technique
involves a particular type of HTTP-CoAP cross proxy, the
reverse cross proxy. This proxy behaves as being the ﬁnal
web server to the HTTP/IPv4 client and as the original client
to the CoAP/IPv6 web server. Since this machine needs to
be placed in a part of the network where IPv6 connectivity is
present to allow direct access to the ﬁnal IoT nodes, IPv4/IPv6
conversion is internally resolved by the applied URI mapping
function.

B. Link Layer Technologies

An urban IoT system, due to its inherently large deployment
area, requires a set of link layer technologies that can easily
cover a wide geographical area and, at the same time, support a
possibly large amount of trafﬁc resulting from the aggregation
of an extremely high number of smaller data ﬂows. For these
reasons, link layer technologies enabling the realization of
an urban IoT system are classiﬁed into unconstrained and
constrained technologies. The ﬁrst group includes all the tra-
ditional LAN, MAN and WAN communication technologies,
such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ﬁber optic, broadband Power Line
Communication (PLC), and cellular technologies as such as
UMTS and LTE. They are generally characterized by high
reliability, low latency, and high transfer rates (order of Mbit/s
or higher), and due to their inherent complexity and energy
consumption are generally not suitable for peripheral IoT
nodes.

The constrained physical and link layer technologies are,
instead, generally characterized by low energy consump-
tion and relatively low transfer rates, typically smaller than
1 Mbit/s. The more prominent solutions in this category
are IEEE 802.15.4 [34], [35] Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low
Energy [36], IEEE 802.11 Low Power, Power Line Commu-
nication (PLC) [37], Near Field Communication (NFC) and
Radio Frequency Identiﬁer (RFID) [38]. These links usually
exhibit
long latencies, mainly due to two factors: (i) the
intrinsically low transmission rate at the physical layer, (ii)
the power saving policies implemented by the nodes to save

energy, which usually involve duty cycling with short active
periods.

C. Devices

We ﬁnally describe the devices that are essential to realize
an urban IoT, classiﬁed based on the position they occupy in
the communication ﬂow.

1) Backend servers: At the root of the system, we ﬁnd
the backend servers, located in the control center, where data
are collected, stored, and processed to produce added-value
services. In principle, backend servers are not mandatory
for an IoT system to properly operate, though they become
a fundamental component of an urban IoT where they can
facilitate the access to the smart city services and open data
through the legacy network infrastructure. Backend systems
commonly considered for interfacing with the IoT data feeders
include the following.

Database Management Systems. These systems are in charge
of storing the large amount of information produced by IoT
peripheral nodes, such as sensors. Depending on the particular
usage scenario, the load on these systems can be quite large,
so that proper dimensioning of the backend system is required.

Web Sites. The widespread acquaintance of people with web
interfaces makes them the ﬁrst option to enable interoperation
between the IoT system and the “data consumers,” e.g., public
authorities, service operators, utility providers, and common
citizens.

Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP). ERP compo-
nents support a variety of business functions and are precious
tools to manage the ﬂow of information across a complex
organization, such as a city administration. Interfacing ERP
components with database management systems that collect
the data generated by the IoT allows for a simpler management
of the potentially massive amount of data gathered by the IoT,
making it possible to separate the information ﬂows based
on their nature and relevance and easing the creation of new
services.

2) Gateways: Moving toward the “edge” of the IoT, we ﬁnd
the gateways, whose role is to interconnect the end devices to
the main communication infrastructure of the system. With
reference to the conceptual protocol architecture depicted in
Fig. 2, the gateway is hence required to provide protocol
translation and functional mapping between the unconstrained
protocols and their constrained counterparts, that is to say
XML-EXI, HTTP-CoAP, IPv4/v6-6LoWPAN.

Note that, while all these translations may be required in
order to enable interoperability with IoT peripheral devices
and control stations, it is not necessary to concentrate all of
them in a single gateway. Rather, it is possible, and sometimes
convenient, to distribute the translation tasks over different
devices in the network. For example, a single HTTP-CoAP
proxy can be deployed to support multiple 6LoWPAN border
routers.

Gateway devices shall also provide the interconnection
between unconstrained link layer technologies, mainly used
in the core of the IoT network, and constrained technologies

7

that, instead, provide connectivity among the IoT peripheral
nodes.

3) IoT peripheral nodes: Finally, at the periphery of the
IoT system we ﬁnd the devices in charge of producing the
data to be delivered to the control center, which are usually
called IoT peripheral nodes or, more simply, IoT nodes.
Generally speaking, the cost of these devices is very low,
starting from 10 USD or even less, depending on the kind and
number of sensors/actuators mounted on the board. IoT nodes
may be classiﬁed based on a wide number of characteristics,
such as powering mode, networking role (relay or leaf), sen-
sor/actuator equipment, supported link layer technologies. The
most constrained IoT nodes are likely the Radio Frequency
tags (RFtags) that, despite their very limited capabilities, can
still play an important role in IoT systems, mainly because
of the extremely low cost and the passive nature of their
communication hardware, which does not require any internal
energy source. The typical application of RFtags is object
identiﬁcation by proximity reading, which can be used for
logistics, maintenance, monitoring, and other services.

Mobile devices, such as smart phones,

tablet PCs, or
laptops, may also be an important part of an urban IoT,
providing other ways to interact with it. For instance, the Near-
Field-Communication (NFC) transceiver integrated in last-
generation smartphones may be used to identify tagged ob-
jects, while the geolocation service provided by most common
operating systems for mobile devices can enrich the context
information associated to that object. Furthermore, mobile
devices can provide access to the IoT in different ways, e.g.,
(i) through an IP connection provided by the cellular data-
link service, or (ii) setting up a direct connection with some
objects by using short-range wireless technologies, such as
Bluetooth Low Energy, low power WiFi, or IEEE 802.15.4.
Furthermore, it is possible to develop speciﬁc applications
for mobile devices that can ease the interaction with the IoT
objects, and with the system as a whole.

IV. AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: PADOVA SMART CITY
The framework discussed in this paper has already been
successfully applied to a number of different use cases in the
context of IoT systems. For instance, the experimental wireless
sensor network testbed, with more than 300 nodes, deployed
at the University of Padova [39], [40] has been designed
according to these guidelines, and successfully used to realize
proof-of-concept demonstrations of smart grid [41], and health
care [42] services.

In this section we describe a practical implementation of
an urban IoT, named “Padova Smart City,” that has been
realized in the city of Padova thanks to the collaboration
between public and private parties, such as the municipality of
Padova, which has sponsored the project, the Department of
Information Engineering of the University of Padova, which
has provided the theoretical background and the feasibility
analysis of the project, and Patavina Technologies s.r.l.,1
a spin-off of the University of Padova specialized in the

development of innovative IoT solutions, which has developed
the IoT nodes and the control software.

The primary goal of Padova Smart City is to promote the
early adoption of open data and ICT solutions in the public
administration. The target application consists of a system for
collecting environmental data and monitoring the public street
lighting by means of wireless nodes, equipped with different
kinds of sensors, placed on street light poles and connected to
the Internet through a gateway unit. This system shall make it
possible to collect interesting environmental parameters, such
as CO level, air temperature and humidity, vibrations, noise,
and so on, while providing a simple but accurate mechanism
to check the correct operation of the public lighting system by
measuring the light intensity at each post. Even if this system
is a simple application of the IoT concept, it still involves a
number of different devices and link layer technologies, thus
being representative of most of the critical issues that need to
be taken care of when designing an urban IoT. A high-level
overview of the types and roles of the devices involved in the
system is given hereafter.

Padova Smart City components. A conceptual sketch of the
Padova Smart City system architecture is given in Fig. 3. In the
following, we describe in more details the different hardware
and software components of the system.

Street light. It is the leaf part of the system where IoT
nodes are placed. Each streetlight is geographically localized
on the city map and uniquely associated to the IoT node
attached to it, so that IoT data can be enhanced with context
information. The monitoring of the correct operation of the
bulbs is performed through photometer sensors that directly
measure the intensity of the light emitted by the lamps (or,
actually, by any source whose light reaches the sensor) at
regular time intervals or upon request. The wireless IoT nodes
are also equipped with temperature and humidity sensors,
which provide data concerning weather conditions, and one
node is also equipped with a benzene (C6H6) sensor, which
monitors air quality. IoT nodes are generally powered by small
batteries, though connection to a low power grid is required

by the benzene sensor. The packaging of the sensor nodes has
been designed by taking into account the speciﬁc requirements
of this use case. Indeed, sensor nodes have been hosted in a
transparent plastic shield that protects the electronic parts from
atmospheric phenomena (like rain or snow), while permitting
the circulation of air and light for the correct measurement of
humidity, temperature, and light intensity.

Constrained link layer technologies. The IoT nodes mounted
on the streetlight poles form a 6LoWPAN multi-hop cloud,
using IEEE 802.15.4 constrained link layer technology. Rout-
ing functionalities are provided by the IPv6 Routing Proto-
col for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [43]. IoT
nodes are assigned unique IPv6 addresses, suitably compressed
according to the 6LoWPAN standard. Each node can be
individually accessible from anywhere in the Internet by means
of IPv6/6LoWPAN. Nodes collectively deliver their data to a
sink node, which represents the single point of contact for
the external nodes. Alternatively, each node might publish
its own features and data by running a CoAP server, though
this feature is not yet implemented in the testbed. In either
case, a gateway is required to bridge the 6LoWPAN cloud to
the Internet and perform all the transcoding described in the
previous section.

WSN Gateway. The gateway has the role of interfacing
the constrained link layer technology used in the sensors
cloud with traditional WAN technologies used to provide
connectivity to the central backend servers. The gateway hence
plays the role of 6LoWPAN border router and RPL root
node. Furthermore, since sensor nodes do not support CoAP
services, the gateway also operates as the sink node for the
sensor cloud, collecting all the data that need to be exported
to the backend services. The connection to the backend ser-
vices is provided by common unconstrained communication
technologies, optical ﬁber in this speciﬁc example.

HTTP-CoAP Proxy. The HTTP-CoAP proxy enables trans-
parent communication with CoAP devices. The proxy logic
can be extended to better support monitoring applications and
limit the amount of trafﬁc injected into the IoT peripheral
is possible to specify a list of
network. For instance,

it

resources that need to be monitored, so that the server can
autonomously update the entries in a cache related to those
devices. This mechanism can be supported by two different
approaches: (i) by polling the selected resource proactively,
thus enabling the implementation of trafﬁc shaping techniques
at the proxy or at the gateway, and (ii) by subscribing to the
selected resource using the “observe” functionality of CoAP,
thus enabling the server on the node to send the updates only
when the value measured by the sensor falls outside a certain
range. This service is co-located on the switchboard gateway in
the Padova Smart City system, though it could also be placed
in the backend servers, thus making it possible to control
multiple gateways by using a single proxy instance.

Database server. The database server collects the state of the
resources that need to be monitored in time by communicating
with the HTTP-CoAP proxy server, which in turn takes care
of retrieving the required data from the proper source. The
data stored in the database are accessible through traditional
web programming technologies. The information can either be
visualized in the form of a web site, or exported in any open
data format using dynamic web programming languages. In
the Padova Smart City network, the database server is realized
within the WSN Gateway, which hence represents a plug-
and-play module that provides a transparent interface with the
peripheral nodes.

Operator mobile device. Public lighting operators will be
equipped with mobile devices that can locate the streetlight
that requires intervention, issue actuation commands directly
to the IoT node connected to the lamp, and signal the result
of the intervention to the central system that can track every
single lamppost and, hence, optimize the maintenance plan.

Such a system can be successively extended to include other
types of IoT nodes or clouds of IoT nodes, provided that
each IoT peripheral system supports an HTTP-based interface,
which makes it possible to interact with it in an open, standard,
and technology independent manner.

A. Example of data collected by Padova Smart City

Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 report an example of the type of data
that can be collected with the Padova Smart City system.
The four plots show the temperature, humidity, light, and
benzene readings over a period of seven days. Thin lines
show the actual readings, while thick lines are obtained by
applying a moving average ﬁlter over a time window of one
hour (approximately 10 readings of temperature, humidity
and light, and 120 readings of the benzene sensor, whose
sampling rate is larger since the node is powered by the
grid). It is possible to observe the regular pattern of the light
measurements, corresponding to day and night periods. In
particular, at daytime the measure reaches the saturation value,
while during nighttime the values are more irregular, due to
the reﬂections produced by vehicle lights. A similar pattern
is exhibited by the humidity and temperature measurements
that, however, are much more noisy than those for light. The
benzene measurements also reveal a decrease of the benzene
levels at nighttime, as expected due to the lighter night trafﬁc,
but quite surprisingly there is no evident variations in the
daytime benzene levels during the week end (Oct. 26-27). It
is also interesting to note the peak of benzene measured in
the early afternoon of Oct. 29. Examining the readings of the
other sensors in the same time interval, we can note a sharp
decrease of light intensity and temperature, and an increase in
humidity. These readings suggest that a quick rainstorm has
temporarily obscured the sunlight, while producing congestion
in the road trafﬁc and, in turn, a peak of benzene in the air.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we analyzed the solutions currently avail-
able for the implementation of urban IoTs. The discussed
technologies are close to being standardized, and industry
players are already active in the production of devices that
take advantage of these technologies to enable the applications
of interest, such as those described in Sec. II. In fact, while
the range of design options for IoT systems is rather wide,
the set of open and standardized protocols is signiﬁcantly

Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incor-
porate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different
and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of
digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is
hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large
variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may
be involved in such a system. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally to
an urban IoT systems that, while still being quite a broad category,
are characterized by their speciﬁc application domain. Urban
IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which
aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies
to support added-value services for the administration of the city
and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive
survey of the enabling technologies, protocols and architecture for
an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the
Padova Smart City project, a proof of concept deployment of an
IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration
with the city municipality.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE IoT is a recent communication paradigm that en-

visions a near future in which the objects of everyday
life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for
digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will
make them able to communicate with one another and with
the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

generated by such objects to provide new services to citi-
zens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm
indeed ﬁnds application in many different domains, such as
home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile
health care, elderly assistance, intelligent energy management
and smart grids, automotive, trafﬁc management and many
others [2].

However, such a heterogeneous ﬁeld of application makes
the identiﬁcation of solutions capable of satisfying the re-
quirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable
challenge. This difﬁculty has led to the proliferation of differ-
ent and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical
realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system per-
spective, the realization of an IoT network, together with the
required backend network services and devices, still lacks an
established best practice because of its novelty and complexity.
In addition to the technical difﬁculties, the adoption of the
IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and
widely accepted business model that can attract investments
to promote the deployment of these technologies [3].

the application of

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the
public administrations. This objective can be pursued by the
deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastruc-
ture that provides uniﬁed, simple, and economical access to a
plethora of public services, thus unleashing potential synergies
and increasing transparency to the citizens. An urban IoT,
indeed, may bring a number of beneﬁts in the management and
optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public
areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection,
salubrity of hospitals and school [5]. Furthermore, the avail-
ability of different types of data, collected by a pervasive
urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the transparency
and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of
their city, stimulate the active participation of the citizens in
the management of public administration, and also stimulate
the creation of new services upon those provided by the
IoT [6]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to
the Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional
administrations that may become the early adopters of such
technologies, thus acting as catalyzers for the adoption of the

IoT paradigm on a wider scale.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

penetration of ICT solutions in this domain, however, may
result in signiﬁcant savings and economical and ecological
advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste contain-
ers that detect the level of load and allow for an optimization
of the collector trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste
collection and improve the quality of recycling [14], [15]. To
realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT shall
connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to
a control center where an optimization software processes the
data and determines the optimal management of the collector
truck ﬂeet.
Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc
hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring service
to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour
in the places that adopt the service [18]. Besides building
a space-time map of the noise pollution in the area, such
a service can also be used to enforce public security, by
means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for

instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service
can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and
the conﬁdence of public establishment owners, although the
installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power
widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Trafﬁc monitoring may be realized by using the
sensing capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles
[19], but also adopting a combination of air quality and
acoustic sensors along a given road. This information is of
great
importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline trafﬁc and to send ofﬁcers where needed,
for the latter to plan in advance the route to reach the ofﬁce
or to better schedule a shopping trip to the city centre.
City energy consumption. Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this
will make it possible to identify the main energy consumption
sources and to set priorities in order to optimize their behavior.
This goes in the direction indicated by the European directive
for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must
be integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it
will also be possible to enhance these service with active
functionalities to control local power production structures
(e.g., photovoltaic panels).

Smart parking. The smart parking service is based on road

III. URBAN IOT ARCHITECTURE

From the analysis of the services described in Sec. II, it
clearly emerges that most Smart City services are based on a
centralized architecture, where a dense and heterogeneous set
of peripheral devices deployed over the urban area generate
different types of data that are then delivered through suitable
communication technologies to a control center, where data
storage and processing are performed.

A primary characteristic of an urban IoT infrastructure,
hence, is its capability of integrating different technologies
with the existing communication infrastructures in order to
support a progressive evolution of the IoT, with the in-
terconnection of other devices and the realization of novel
functionalities and services. Another fundamental aspect is the
necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT
easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the
responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and promote the
awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters
[11].

In the rest of this section we describe the different compo-
nents of an urban IoT system, as sketched in Fig. 1. We start
describing the web service approach for the design of IoT
services, which requires the deployment of suitable protocol
layers in the different elements of the network, as shown in
the protocol stacks depicted in Fig. 1 besides the key elements
of the architecture. Then, we brieﬂy overview the link layer
technologies that can be used to interconnect the different
parts of the IoT. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous set
of devices that concur to the realization of an urban IoT.

A. Web service approach for IoT service architecture

Although in the IoT many different standards are still
struggling to be the reference one and the most adopted, in this
section we focus speciﬁcally on IETF standards because they
are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices,
and can count on a wide community.

The IETF standards for IoT embrace a web service archi-
tecture for IoT services, which has been widely documented
in the literature as a very promising and ﬂexible approach. In
fact, web services permit to realize a ﬂexible and interoperable
system that can be extended to IoT nodes, through the adoption
of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State
Transfer (ReST) [22]. IoT services designed in accordance
with the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with
traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption
and use of IoT by both end users and service developers,
which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge
gained from traditional web technologies in the development
of services for networks containing smart objects. The web
service approach is also promoted by international standard-
ization bodies such as IETF, ETSI and W3C, among others, as
well as European research projects on the Internet of Things
such as SENSEI [23], IoT-A [24] and SmartSantander [5].

Fig. 2 shows a reference protocol architecture for the
urban IoT system that entails both an unconstrained and a
constrained protocol stack. The ﬁrst consists of the protocols

service approach.

sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the
best path for parking in the city [20]. The beneﬁts deriving
from this service are manifold: faster time to locate a parking
slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
less trafﬁc
congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service
can be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure,
because many companies in Europe are providing market
products for this application. Furthermore, by using short-
range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identiﬁers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is
possible to realize an electronic veriﬁcation system of parking
permits in slots reserved for residents or disabled, thus offering
a better service to citizens that can legitimately use those slots
and an efﬁcient tool for quickly spot violations.

Smart lighting. In order to support the 202020 directive, the
optimization of the street lighting efﬁciency is an important
feature. In particular,
this service can optimize the street
lamp intensity according to the time of the day, the weather
conditions and the presence of people. In order to properly
work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit
the increased number of connected spots to provide WiFi
connection to citizens. In addition, a fault detection system
will be easily realized on top of the street light controllers.

Automation and salubrity of public buildings. Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of
the energy consumption and the salubrity of the environment
in public buildings (schools, administration ofﬁces, museums)
by means of different types of sensors and actuators that
control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters,
is possible to enhance the level of
comfort of the persons that live in these environments, which
may also have a positive return in terms of productivity, while
reducing the costs for heating/cooling [21].

EXI processors share an XML Schema before actual encoding
and decoding can take place. This shared schema makes it
possible to assign numeric identiﬁers to the XML tags in the
schema and build the EXI grammars upon such coding. As
discussed in [27], a general purpose schema-informed EXI
processor can be easily integrated even in very constrained
devices, enabling them to interpret EXI formats and, hence,
making it possible to build multi-purpose IoT nodes even
out of very constrained devices. Using the schema-informed
approach, however, requires additional care in the development
of higher layer application, since developers need to deﬁne an
XML Schema for the messages involved in the application and
use EXI processors that support this operating mode. Further
details about EXI and schema-informed processing can be
found in [27].

Integration of multiple XML/EXI data sources into an IoT
system can be obtained by using the databases typically
created and maintained by high-level applications. In fact, IoT
applications generally build a database of the nodes controlled
by the application and, often, of the data generated by such
nodes. The database makes it possible to integrate the data
received by any IoT device to provide the speciﬁc service
the application is built for. A generic framework for building
IoT web applications according to the guidelines described
in this section has been proposed in [28], where the authors
also suggest exploiting the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
(AJAX) capabilities of modern web browsers that allow for a
direct communication between the browser and the ﬁnal IoT
node, demonstrating the full internetworking of the protocol
stack and the open data nature of the proposed approach.

2) Application and transport layers: Most of the trafﬁc that
crosses the Internet today is carried at the application layer by
HTTP over TCP. However, the verbosity and complexity of
native HTTP make it unsuitable for a straight deployment on
constrained IoT devices. For such an environment, in fact, the
human-readable format of HTTP, which has been one of the
reasons of its success in traditional networks, turns out to be
a limiting factor due to the large amount of heavily correlated
(and, hence, redundant) data. Moreover, HTTP typically relies
upon the TCP transport protocol that, however, does not scale
well on constrained devices, yielding poor performance for
small data ﬂows in lossy environments.

The CoAP protocol [29] overcomes these difﬁculties by
proposing a binary format transported over UDP, handling
only the retransmissions strictly required to provide a reliable
service. Moreover, CoAP can easily interoperate with HTTP
because: (i) it supports the ReST methods of HTTP (GET,
PUT, POST, and DELETE), (ii) there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the response codes of the two protocols,
and (iii) the CoAP options can support a wide range of HTTP
usage scenarios.

Even though regular Internet hosts can natively support
CoAP to directly talk to IoT devices, the most general and
easily interoperable solution requires the deployment of an
HTTP-CoAP intermediary, also known as cross proxy, that
can straightforwardly translate requests/responses between the
two protocols, thus enabling transparent interoperation with
native HTTP devices and applications [30].

nodes.

Protocol stacks for unconstrained (left) and constrained (right) IoT

that are currently the de-facto standards for Internet communi-
cations, and are commonly used by regular Internet hosts, such
as XML, HTTP, and IPv4. These protocols are mirrored in
the constrained protocol stack by their low-complexity coun-
terparts, i.e., the Efﬁcient XML Interchange (EXI), the Con-
strained Application Protocol (CoAP), and 6LoWPAN, which
are suitable even for very constrained devices. The transcoding
operations between the protocols in the left and right stacks
in Fig. 2 can be performed in a standard and low complexity
manner, thus guaranteeing easy access and interoperability of
the IoT nodes with the Internet. It may be worth remarking that
systems that do not adopt the EXI/CoAP/6LoWPAN protocol
stack can still be seamlessly included in the urban IoT system,
provided that they are capable of interfacing with all the layers
of the left-hand side of the protocol architecture in Fig. 2.

In the protocol architecture shown in Fig. 2 we can dis-
tinguish three distinct functional layers, namely (i) Data, (ii)
Application/Transport, and (iii) Network,
that may require
dedicated entities to operate the transcoding between con-
strained and unconstrained formats and protocols. In the rest
of this section, we specify in greater detail the requirements
at each of the three functional layers in order to guarantee
interoperability among the different parts of the system.

1) Data format: As mentioned, the urban IoT paradigm
sets speciﬁc requirements in terms of data accessibility. In
architectures based on web services, data exchange is typically
accompanied by a description of the transferred content by
means of semantic representation languages, of which the
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is probably the most
common. Nevertheless, the size of XML messages is often too
large for the limited capacity of typical devices for the IoT.
Furthermore, the text nature of XML representation makes the
parsing of messages by CPU-limited devices more complex
compared to the binary formats. For these reasons, the working
group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [25] has
proposed the EXI format [26], which makes it possible even
for very constrained devices to natively support and generate
messages using an open data format compatible with XML.
EXI deﬁnes two types of encoding, namely schema-less
and schema-informed. While the schema-less encoding is
generated directly from the XML data and can be decoded
by any EXI entity without any prior knowledge about the
data, the schema-informed encoding assumes that the two

ogy supported by Internet hosts. However, IANA, the interna-
tional organization that assigns IP addresses at a global level,
has recently announced the exhaustion of IPv4 address blocks.
IoT networks, in turn, are expected to include billions of nodes,
each of which shall be (in principle) uniquely addressable. A
solution to this problem is offered by the IPv6 standard [31],
which provides a 128-bit address ﬁeld, thus making it possible
to assign a unique IPv6 address to any possible node in the
IoT network.

While, on the one hand, the huge address space of IPv6
makes it possible to solve the addressing issues in IoT, on
the other hand it introduces overheads that are not compat-
ible with the scarce capabilities of constrained nodes. This
problem can be overcome by adopting 6LoWPAN [32] [33],
which is an established compression format for IPv6 and
UDP headers over low-power constrained networks. A border
router, that is a device directly attached to the 6LoWPAN net-
work, transparently performs the conversion between IPv6 and
6LoWPAN, translating any IPv6 packet intended for a node in
the 6LoWPAN network into a packet with 6LoWPAN header
compression format, and operating the inverse translation in
the opposite direction.

While the deployment of a 6LoWPAN border router enables
transparent interaction between IoT nodes and any IPv6 host
in the Internet, the interaction with IPv4-only hosts remains
an issue. More speciﬁcally, the problem consists in ﬁnding a
way to address a speciﬁc IPv6 host using an IPv4 address and
other meta-data available in the packet. In the following we
present different approaches to achieve this goal.

v4/v6 Port Address Translation (v4/v6 PAT). This method
maps arbitrary pairs of IPv4 addresses and TCP/UDP ports
into IPv6 addresses and TCP/UDP ports. It resembles the clas-
sical Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) service
currently supported in many LANs to provide Internet access
to a number of hosts in a private network by sharing a common
public IPv4 address, which is used to address the packets
over the public Internet. When a packet is returned to the
IPv4 common address, the edge router that supports the NATP
service will intercept the packet and replace the common IPv4
destination address with the (private) address of the intended
receiver, which is determined by looking up in the NATP table
the address of the host associated to the speciﬁc destination
port carried by the packet. The same technique can be used
to map multiple IPv6 addresses into a single IPv4 public
address, which allows the forwarding of the datagrams in the
IPv4 network and its correct management at IPv4-only hosts.
The application of this technique requires low complexity
and, indeed, port mapping is an established technique for
v4/v6 transition. On the other hand, this approach raises a
scalability problem, since the number of IPv6 hosts that can
be multiplexed into a single IPv4 address is limited by the
number of available TCP/UDP ports (65535). Furthermore,
this approach requires that the connection be initiated by the
IPv6 nodes in order to create the correct entries in the NATP
look up table. Connections starting from the IPv4 cloud can
also be realized, but this requires a more complex architecture,
with the local DNS placed within the IPv6 network and

6

statically associated to a public IPv4 address in the NATP
translation table.

v4/v6 Domain Name Conversion. This method, originally
proposed in [30], is similar to the technique used to provide
virtual hosting service in HTTP 1.1, which makes it possible to
support multiple websites on the same web server, sharing the
same IPv4 address, by exploiting the information contained
in the HTTP Host header to identify the speciﬁc web site
requested by the user. Similarly, it is possible to program the
DNS servers in such a way that, upon a DNS request for
the domain name of an IoT web service, the DNS returns the
IPv4 address of an HTTP-CoAP cross proxy to be contacted to
access the IoT node. Once addressed by an HTTP request, the
proxy requires the resolution of the domain name contained in
the HTTP Host header to the IPv6 DNS server, which replies
with the IPv6 address that identiﬁes the ﬁnal IoT node involved
in the request. The proxy can then forward the HTTP message
to the intended IoT via CoAP.

URI mapping. The Universal Resource Identiﬁer (URI)
mapping technique is also described in [30]. This technique
involves a particular type of HTTP-CoAP cross proxy, the
reverse cross proxy. This proxy behaves as being the ﬁnal
web server to the HTTP/IPv4 client and as the original client
to the CoAP/IPv6 web server. Since this machine needs to
be placed in a part of the network where IPv6 connectivity is
present to allow direct access to the ﬁnal IoT nodes, IPv4/IPv6
conversion is internally resolved by the applied URI mapping
function.

B. Link Layer Technologies

An urban IoT system, due to its inherently large deployment
area, requires a set of link layer technologies that can easily
cover a wide geographical area and, at the same time, support a
possibly large amount of trafﬁc resulting from the aggregation
of an extremely high number of smaller data ﬂows. For these
reasons, link layer technologies enabling the realization of
an urban IoT system are classiﬁed into unconstrained and
constrained technologies. The ﬁrst group includes all the tra-
ditional LAN, MAN and WAN communication technologies,
such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ﬁber optic, broadband Power Line
Communication (PLC), and cellular technologies as such as
UMTS and LTE. They are generally characterized by high
reliability, low latency, and high transfer rates (order of Mbit/s
or higher), and due to their inherent complexity and energy
consumption are generally not suitable for peripheral IoT
nodes.

The constrained physical and link layer technologies are,
instead, generally characterized by low energy consump-
tion and relatively low transfer rates, typically smaller than
1 Mbit/s. The more prominent solutions in this category
are IEEE 802.15.4 [34], [35] Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low
Energy [36], IEEE 802.11 Low Power, Power Line Commu-
nication (PLC) [37], Near Field Communication (NFC) and
Radio Frequency Identiﬁer (RFID) [38]. These links usually
exhibit
long latencies, mainly due to two factors: (i) the
intrinsically low transmission rate at the physical layer, (ii)
the power saving policies implemented by the nodes to save

energy, which usually involve duty cycling with short active
periods.

C. Devices

We ﬁnally describe the devices that are essential to realize
an urban IoT, classiﬁed based on the position they occupy in
the communication ﬂow.

1) Backend servers: At the root of the system, we ﬁnd
the backend servers, located in the control center, where data
are collected, stored, and processed to produce added-value
services. In principle, backend servers are not mandatory
for an IoT system to properly operate, though they become
a fundamental component of an urban IoT where they can
facilitate the access to the smart city services and open data
through the legacy network infrastructure. Backend systems
commonly considered for interfacing with the IoT data feeders
include the following.

Database Management Systems. These systems are in charge
of storing the large amount of information produced by IoT
peripheral nodes, such as sensors. Depending on the particular
usage scenario, the load on these systems can be quite large,
so that proper dimensioning of the backend system is required.

Web Sites. The widespread acquaintance of people with web
interfaces makes them the ﬁrst option to enable interoperation
between the IoT system and the “data consumers,” e.g., public
authorities, service operators, utility providers, and common
citizens.

Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP). ERP compo-
nents support a variety of business functions and are precious
tools to manage the ﬂow of information across a complex
organization, such as a city administration. Interfacing ERP
components with database management systems that collect
the data generated by the IoT allows for a simpler management
of the potentially massive amount of data gathered by the IoT,
making it possible to separate the information ﬂows based
on their nature and relevance and easing the creation of new
services.

2) Gateways: Moving toward the “edge” of the IoT, we ﬁnd
the gateways, whose role is to interconnect the end devices to
the main communication infrastructure of the system. With
reference to the conceptual protocol architecture depicted in
Fig. 2, the gateway is hence required to provide protocol
translation and functional mapping between the unconstrained
protocols and their constrained counterparts, that is to say
XML-EXI, HTTP-CoAP, IPv4/v6-6LoWPAN.

Note that, while all these translations may be required in
order to enable interoperability with IoT peripheral devices
and control stations, it is not necessary to concentrate all of
them in a single gateway. Rather, it is possible, and sometimes
convenient, to distribute the translation tasks over different
devices in the network. For example, a single HTTP-CoAP
proxy can be deployed to support multiple 6LoWPAN border
routers.

Gateway devices shall also provide the interconnection
between unconstrained link layer technologies, mainly used
in the core of the IoT network, and constrained technologies

7

that, instead, provide connectivity among the IoT peripheral
nodes.

3) IoT peripheral nodes: Finally, at the periphery of the
IoT system we ﬁnd the devices in charge of producing the
data to be delivered to the control center, which are usually
called IoT peripheral nodes or, more simply, IoT nodes.
Generally speaking, the cost of these devices is very low,
starting from 10 USD or even less, depending on the kind and
number of sensors/actuators mounted on the board. IoT nodes
may be classiﬁed based on a wide number of characteristics,
such as powering mode, networking role (relay or leaf), sen-
sor/actuator equipment, supported link layer technologies. The
most constrained IoT nodes are likely the Radio Frequency
tags (RFtags) that, despite their very limited capabilities, can
still play an important role in IoT systems, mainly because
of the extremely low cost and the passive nature of their
communication hardware, which does not require any internal
energy source. The typical application of RFtags is object
identiﬁcation by proximity reading, which can be used for
logistics, maintenance, monitoring, and other services.

Mobile devices, such as smart phones,

tablet PCs, or
laptops, may also be an important part of an urban IoT,
providing other ways to interact with it. For instance, the Near-
Field-Communication (NFC) transceiver integrated in last-
generation smartphones may be used to identify tagged ob-
jects, while the geolocation service provided by most common
operating systems for mobile devices can enrich the context
information associated to that object. Furthermore, mobile
devices can provide access to the IoT in different ways, e.g.,
(i) through an IP connection provided by the cellular data-
link service, or (ii) setting up a direct connection with some
objects by using short-range wireless technologies, such as
Bluetooth Low Energy, low power WiFi, or IEEE 802.15.4.
Furthermore, it is possible to develop speciﬁc applications
for mobile devices that can ease the interaction with the IoT
objects, and with the system as a whole.

IV. AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: PADOVA SMART CITY
The framework discussed in this paper has already been
successfully applied to a number of different use cases in the
context of IoT systems. For instance, the experimental wireless
sensor network testbed, with more than 300 nodes, deployed
at the University of Padova [39], [40] has been designed
according to these guidelines, and successfully used to realize
proof-of-concept demonstrations of smart grid [41], and health
care [42] services.

In this section we describe a practical implementation of
an urban IoT, named “Padova Smart City,” that has been
realized in the city of Padova thanks to the collaboration
between public and private parties, such as the municipality of
Padova, which has sponsored the project, the Department of
Information Engineering of the University of Padova, which
has provided the theoretical background and the feasibility
analysis of the project, and Patavina Technologies s.r.l.,1
a spin-off of the University of Padova specialized in the

development of innovative IoT solutions, which has developed
the IoT nodes and the control software.

The primary goal of Padova Smart City is to promote the
early adoption of open data and ICT solutions in the public
administration. The target application consists of a system for
collecting environmental data and monitoring the public street
lighting by means of wireless nodes, equipped with different
kinds of sensors, placed on street light poles and connected to
the Internet through a gateway unit. This system shall make it
possible to collect interesting environmental parameters, such
as CO level, air temperature and humidity, vibrations, noise,
and so on, while providing a simple but accurate mechanism
to check the correct operation of the public lighting system by
measuring the light intensity at each post. Even if this system
is a simple application of the IoT concept, it still involves a
number of different devices and link layer technologies, thus
being representative of most of the critical issues that need to
be taken care of when designing an urban IoT. A high-level
overview of the types and roles of the devices involved in the
system is given hereafter.

Padova Smart City components. A conceptual sketch of the
Padova Smart City system architecture is given in Fig. 3. In the
following, we describe in more details the different hardware
and software components of the system.

Street light. It is the leaf part of the system where IoT
nodes are placed. Each streetlight is geographically localized
on the city map and uniquely associated to the IoT node
attached to it, so that IoT data can be enhanced with context
information. The monitoring of the correct operation of the
bulbs is performed through photometer sensors that directly
measure the intensity of the light emitted by the lamps (or,
actually, by any source whose light reaches the sensor) at
regular time intervals or upon request. The wireless IoT nodes
are also equipped with temperature and humidity sensors,
which provide data concerning weather conditions, and one
node is also equipped with a benzene (C6H6) sensor, which
monitors air quality. IoT nodes are generally powered by small
batteries, though connection to a low power grid is required

by the benzene sensor. The packaging of the sensor nodes has
been designed by taking into account the speciﬁc requirements
of this use case. Indeed, sensor nodes have been hosted in a
transparent plastic shield that protects the electronic parts from
atmospheric phenomena (like rain or snow), while permitting
the circulation of air and light for the correct measurement of
humidity, temperature, and light intensity.

Constrained link layer technologies. The IoT nodes mounted
on the streetlight poles form a 6LoWPAN multi-hop cloud,
using IEEE 802.15.4 constrained link layer technology. Rout-
ing functionalities are provided by the IPv6 Routing Proto-
col for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [43]. IoT
nodes are assigned unique IPv6 addresses, suitably compressed
according to the 6LoWPAN standard. Each node can be
individually accessible from anywhere in the Internet by means
of IPv6/6LoWPAN. Nodes collectively deliver their data to a
sink node, which represents the single point of contact for
the external nodes. Alternatively, each node might publish
its own features and data by running a CoAP server, though
this feature is not yet implemented in the testbed. In either
case, a gateway is required to bridge the 6LoWPAN cloud to
the Internet and perform all the transcoding described in the
previous section.

WSN Gateway. The gateway has the role of interfacing
the constrained link layer technology used in the sensors
cloud with traditional WAN technologies used to provide
connectivity to the central backend servers. The gateway hence
plays the role of 6LoWPAN border router and RPL root
node. Furthermore, since sensor nodes do not support CoAP
services, the gateway also operates as the sink node for the
sensor cloud, collecting all the data that need to be exported
to the backend services. The connection to the backend ser-
vices is provided by common unconstrained communication
technologies, optical ﬁber in this speciﬁc example.

HTTP-CoAP Proxy. The HTTP-CoAP proxy enables trans-
parent communication with CoAP devices. The proxy logic
can be extended to better support monitoring applications and
limit the amount of trafﬁc injected into the IoT peripheral
is possible to specify a list of
network. For instance,

it

resources that need to be monitored, so that the server can
autonomously update the entries in a cache related to those
devices. This mechanism can be supported by two different
approaches: (i) by polling the selected resource proactively,
thus enabling the implementation of trafﬁc shaping techniques
at the proxy or at the gateway, and (ii) by subscribing to the
selected resource using the “observe” functionality of CoAP,
thus enabling the server on the node to send the updates only
when the value measured by the sensor falls outside a certain
range. This service is co-located on the switchboard gateway in
the Padova Smart City system, though it could also be placed
in the backend servers, thus making it possible to control
multiple gateways by using a single proxy instance.

Database server. The database server collects the state of the
resources that need to be monitored in time by communicating
with the HTTP-CoAP proxy server, which in turn takes care
of retrieving the required data from the proper source. The
data stored in the database are accessible through traditional
web programming technologies. The information can either be
visualized in the form of a web site, or exported in any open
data format using dynamic web programming languages. In
the Padova Smart City network, the database server is realized
within the WSN Gateway, which hence represents a plug-
and-play module that provides a transparent interface with the
peripheral nodes.

Operator mobile device. Public lighting operators will be
equipped with mobile devices that can locate the streetlight
that requires intervention, issue actuation commands directly
to the IoT node connected to the lamp, and signal the result
of the intervention to the central system that can track every
single lamppost and, hence, optimize the maintenance plan.

Such a system can be successively extended to include other
types of IoT nodes or clouds of IoT nodes, provided that
each IoT peripheral system supports an HTTP-based interface,
which makes it possible to interact with it in an open, standard,
and technology independent manner.

A. Example of data collected by Padova Smart City

Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 report an example of the type of data
that can be collected with the Padova Smart City system.
The four plots show the temperature, humidity, light, and
benzene readings over a period of seven days. Thin lines
show the actual readings, while thick lines are obtained by
applying a moving average ﬁlter over a time window of one
hour (approximately 10 readings of temperature, humidity
and light, and 120 readings of the benzene sensor, whose
sampling rate is larger since the node is powered by the
grid). It is possible to observe the regular pattern of the light
measurements, corresponding to day and night periods. In
particular, at daytime the measure reaches the saturation value,
while during nighttime the values are more irregular, due to
the reﬂections produced by vehicle lights. A similar pattern
is exhibited by the humidity and temperature measurements
that, however, are much more noisy than those for light. The
benzene measurements also reveal a decrease of the benzene
levels at nighttime, as expected due to the lighter night trafﬁc,
but quite surprisingly there is no evident variations in the
daytime benzene levels during the week end (Oct. 26-27). It
is also interesting to note the peak of benzene measured in
the early afternoon of Oct. 29. Examining the readings of the
other sensors in the same time interval, we can note a sharp
decrease of light intensity and temperature, and an increase in
humidity. These readings suggest that a quick rainstorm has
temporarily obscured the sunlight, while producing congestion
in the road trafﬁc and, in turn, a peak of benzene in the air.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we analyzed the solutions currently avail-
able for the implementation of urban IoTs. The discussed
technologies are close to being standardized, and industry
players are already active in the production of devices that
take advantage of these technologies to enable the applications
of interest, such as those described in Sec. II. In fact, while
the range of design options for IoT systems is rather wide,
the set of open and standardized protocols is signiﬁcantly

smaller. The enabling technologies, furthermore, have reached
a level of maturity that allows for the practical realization
of IoT solutions and services, starting from ﬁeld trials that
will hopefully help clear the uncertainty that still prevents a
massive adoption of the IoT paradigm. A concrete proof of
concept implementation, deployed in collaboration with the
city of Padova, Italy, has also been described as a relevant
example of application of the IoT paradigm to smart cities.

Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incor-
porate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different
and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of
digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is
hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large
variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may
be involved in such a system. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally to
an urban IoT systems that, while still being quite a broad category,
are characterized by their speciﬁc application domain. Urban
IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which
aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies
to support added-value services for the administration of the city
and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive
survey of the enabling technologies, protocols and architecture for
an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the
Padova Smart City project, a proof of concept deployment of an
IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration
with the city municipality.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE IoT is a recent communication paradigm that en-

visions a near future in which the objects of everyday
life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for
digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will
make them able to communicate with one another and with
the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

generated by such objects to provide new services to citi-
zens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm
indeed ﬁnds application in many different domains, such as
home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile
health care, elderly assistance, intelligent energy management
and smart grids, automotive, trafﬁc management and many
others [2].

However, such a heterogeneous ﬁeld of application makes
the identiﬁcation of solutions capable of satisfying the re-
quirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable
challenge. This difﬁculty has led to the proliferation of differ-
ent and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical
realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system per-
spective, the realization of an IoT network, together with the
required backend network services and devices, still lacks an
established best practice because of its novelty and complexity.
In addition to the technical difﬁculties, the adoption of the
IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and
widely accepted business model that can attract investments
to promote the deployment of these technologies [3].

the application of

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the
public administrations. This objective can be pursued by the
deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastruc-
ture that provides uniﬁed, simple, and economical access to a
plethora of public services, thus unleashing potential synergies
and increasing transparency to the citizens. An urban IoT,
indeed, may bring a number of beneﬁts in the management and
optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public
areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection,
salubrity of hospitals and school [5]. Furthermore, the avail-
ability of different types of data, collected by a pervasive
urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the transparency
and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of
their city, stimulate the active participation of the citizens in
the management of public administration, and also stimulate
the creation of new services upon those provided by the
IoT [6]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to
the Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional
administrations that may become the early adopters of such
technologies, thus acting as catalyzers for the adoption of the

IoT paradigm on a wider scale.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

penetration of ICT solutions in this domain, however, may
result in signiﬁcant savings and economical and ecological
advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste contain-
ers that detect the level of load and allow for an optimization
of the collector trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste
collection and improve the quality of recycling [14], [15]. To
realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT shall
connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to
a control center where an optimization software processes the
data and determines the optimal management of the collector
truck ﬂeet.
Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc
hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring service
to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour
in the places that adopt the service [18]. Besides building
a space-time map of the noise pollution in the area, such
a service can also be used to enforce public security, by
means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for

instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service
can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and
the conﬁdence of public establishment owners, although the
installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power
widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Trafﬁc monitoring may be realized by using the
sensing capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles
[19], but also adopting a combination of air quality and
acoustic sensors along a given road. This information is of
great
importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline trafﬁc and to send ofﬁcers where needed,
for the latter to plan in advance the route to reach the ofﬁce
or to better schedule a shopping trip to the city centre.
City energy consumption. Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this
will make it possible to identify the main energy consumption
sources and to set priorities in order to optimize their behavior.
This goes in the direction indicated by the European directive
for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must
be integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it
will also be possible to enhance these service with active
functionalities to control local power production structures
(e.g., photovoltaic panels).

Smart parking. The smart parking service is based on road

III. URBAN IOT ARCHITECTURE

From the analysis of the services described in Sec. II, it
clearly emerges that most Smart City services are based on a
centralized architecture, where a dense and heterogeneous set
of peripheral devices deployed over the urban area generate
different types of data that are then delivered through suitable
communication technologies to a control center, where data
storage and processing are performed.

A primary characteristic of an urban IoT infrastructure,
hence, is its capability of integrating different technologies
with the existing communication infrastructures in order to
support a progressive evolution of the IoT, with the in-
terconnection of other devices and the realization of novel
functionalities and services. Another fundamental aspect is the
necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT
easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the
responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and promote the
awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters
[11].

In the rest of this section we describe the different compo-
nents of an urban IoT system, as sketched in Fig. 1. We start
describing the web service approach for the design of IoT
services, which requires the deployment of suitable protocol
layers in the different elements of the network, as shown in
the protocol stacks depicted in Fig. 1 besides the key elements
of the architecture. Then, we brieﬂy overview the link layer
technologies that can be used to interconnect the different
parts of the IoT. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous set
of devices that concur to the realization of an urban IoT.

A. Web service approach for IoT service architecture

Although in the IoT many different standards are still
struggling to be the reference one and the most adopted, in this
section we focus speciﬁcally on IETF standards because they
are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices,
and can count on a wide community.

The IETF standards for IoT embrace a web service archi-
tecture for IoT services, which has been widely documented
in the literature as a very promising and ﬂexible approach. In
fact, web services permit to realize a ﬂexible and interoperable
system that can be extended to IoT nodes, through the adoption
of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State
Transfer (ReST) [22]. IoT services designed in accordance
with the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with
traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption
and use of IoT by both end users and service developers,
which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge
gained from traditional web technologies in the development
of services for networks containing smart objects. The web
service approach is also promoted by international standard-
ization bodies such as IETF, ETSI and W3C, among others, as
well as European research projects on the Internet of Things
such as SENSEI [23], IoT-A [24] and SmartSantander [5].

urban IoT system that entails both an unconstrained and a
constrained protocol stack. The ﬁrst consists of the protocols

service approach.

sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the
best path for parking in the city [20]. The beneﬁts deriving
from this service are manifold: faster time to locate a parking
slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
less trafﬁc
congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service
can be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure,
because many companies in Europe are providing market
products for this application. Furthermore, by using short-
range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identiﬁers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is
possible to realize an electronic veriﬁcation system of parking
permits in slots reserved for residents or disabled, thus offering
a better service to citizens that can legitimately use those slots
and an efﬁcient tool for quickly spot violations.

Smart lighting. In order to support the 202020 directive, the
optimization of the street lighting efﬁciency is an important
feature. In particular,
this service can optimize the street
lamp intensity according to the time of the day, the weather
conditions and the presence of people. In order to properly
work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit
the increased number of connected spots to provide WiFi
connection to citizens. In addition, a fault detection system
will be easily realized on top of the street light controllers.

Automation and salubrity of public buildings. Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of
the energy consumption and the salubrity of the environment
in public buildings (schools, administration ofﬁces, museums)
by means of different types of sensors and actuators that
control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters,
is possible to enhance the level of
comfort of the persons that live in these environments, which
may also have a positive return in terms of productivity, while
reducing the costs for heating/cooling [21].

EXI processors share an XML Schema before actual encoding
and decoding can take place. This shared schema makes it
possible to assign numeric identiﬁers to the XML tags in the
schema and build the EXI grammars upon such coding. As
discussed in [27], a general purpose schema-informed EXI
processor can be easily integrated even in very constrained
devices, enabling them to interpret EXI formats and, hence,
making it possible to build multi-purpose IoT nodes even
out of very constrained devices. Using the schema-informed
approach, however, requires additional care in the development
of higher layer application, since developers need to deﬁne an
XML Schema for the messages involved in the application and
use EXI processors that support this operating mode. Further
details about EXI and schema-informed processing can be
found in [27].

Integration of multiple XML/EXI data sources into an IoT
system can be obtained by using the databases typically
created and maintained by high-level applications. In fact, IoT
applications generally build a database of the nodes controlled
by the application and, often, of the data generated by such
nodes. The database makes it possible to integrate the data
received by any IoT device to provide the speciﬁc service
the application is built for. A generic framework for building
IoT web applications according to the guidelines described
in this section has been proposed in [28], where the authors
also suggest exploiting the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
(AJAX) capabilities of modern web browsers that allow for a
direct communication between the browser and the ﬁnal IoT
node, demonstrating the full internetworking of the protocol
stack and the open data nature of the proposed approach.

2) Application and transport layers: Most of the trafﬁc that
crosses the Internet today is carried at the application layer by
HTTP over TCP. However, the verbosity and complexity of
native HTTP make it unsuitable for a straight deployment on
constrained IoT devices. For such an environment, in fact, the
human-readable format of HTTP, which has been one of the
reasons of its success in traditional networks, turns out to be
a limiting factor due to the large amount of heavily correlated
(and, hence, redundant) data. Moreover, HTTP typically relies
upon the TCP transport protocol that, however, does not scale
well on constrained devices, yielding poor performance for
small data ﬂows in lossy environments.

The CoAP protocol [29] overcomes these difﬁculties by
proposing a binary format transported over UDP, handling
only the retransmissions strictly required to provide a reliable
service. Moreover, CoAP can easily interoperate with HTTP
because: (i) it supports the ReST methods of HTTP (GET,
PUT, POST, and DELETE), (ii) there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the response codes of the two protocols,
and (iii) the CoAP options can support a wide range of HTTP
usage scenarios.

Even though regular Internet hosts can natively support
CoAP to directly talk to IoT devices, the most general and
easily interoperable solution requires the deployment of an
HTTP-CoAP intermediary, also known as cross proxy, that
can straightforwardly translate requests/responses between the
two protocols, thus enabling transparent interoperation with
native HTTP devices and applications [30].

nodes.

Protocol stacks for unconstrained (left) and constrained (right) IoT

that are currently the de-facto standards for Internet communi-
cations, and are commonly used by regular Internet hosts, such
as XML, HTTP, and IPv4. These protocols are mirrored in
the constrained protocol stack by their low-complexity coun-
terparts, i.e., the Efﬁcient XML Interchange (EXI), the Con-
strained Application Protocol (CoAP), and 6LoWPAN, which
are suitable even for very constrained devices. The transcoding
operations between the protocols in the left and right stacks
in Fig. 2 can be performed in a standard and low complexity
manner, thus guaranteeing easy access and interoperability of
the IoT nodes with the Internet. It may be worth remarking that
systems that do not adopt the EXI/CoAP/6LoWPAN protocol
stack can still be seamlessly included in the urban IoT system,
provided that they are capable of interfacing with all the layers
of the left-hand side of the protocol architecture in Fig. 2.

In the protocol architecture shown in Fig. 2 we can dis-
tinguish three distinct functional layers, namely (i) Data, (ii)
Application/Transport, and (iii) Network,
that may require
dedicated entities to operate the transcoding between con-
strained and unconstrained formats and protocols. In the rest
of this section, we specify in greater detail the requirements
at each of the three functional layers in order to guarantee
interoperability among the different parts of the system.

1) Data format: As mentioned, the urban IoT paradigm
sets speciﬁc requirements in terms of data accessibility. In
architectures based on web services, data exchange is typically
accompanied by a description of the transferred content by
means of semantic representation languages, of which the
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is probably the most
common. Nevertheless, the size of XML messages is often too
large for the limited capacity of typical devices for the IoT.
Furthermore, the text nature of XML representation makes the
parsing of messages by CPU-limited devices more complex
compared to the binary formats. For these reasons, the working
group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [25] has
proposed the EXI format [26], which makes it possible even
for very constrained devices to natively support and generate
messages using an open data format compatible with XML.
EXI deﬁnes two types of encoding, namely schema-less
and schema-informed. While the schema-less encoding is
generated directly from the XML data and can be decoded
by any EXI entity without any prior knowledge about the
data, the schema-informed encoding assumes that the two

ogy supported by Internet hosts. However, IANA, the interna-
tional organization that assigns IP addresses at a global level,
has recently announced the exhaustion of IPv4 address blocks.
IoT networks, in turn, are expected to include billions of nodes,
each of which shall be (in principle) uniquely addressable. A
solution to this problem is offered by the IPv6 standard [31],
which provides a 128-bit address ﬁeld, thus making it possible
to assign a unique IPv6 address to any possible node in the
IoT network.

While, on the one hand, the huge address space of IPv6
makes it possible to solve the addressing issues in IoT, on
the other hand it introduces overheads that are not compat-
ible with the scarce capabilities of constrained nodes. This
problem can be overcome by adopting 6LoWPAN [32] [33],
which is an established compression format for IPv6 and
UDP headers over low-power constrained networks. A border
router, that is a device directly attached to the 6LoWPAN net-
work, transparently performs the conversion between IPv6 and
6LoWPAN, translating any IPv6 packet intended for a node in
the 6LoWPAN network into a packet with 6LoWPAN header
compression format, and operating the inverse translation in
the opposite direction.

While the deployment of a 6LoWPAN border router enables
transparent interaction between IoT nodes and any IPv6 host
in the Internet, the interaction with IPv4-only hosts remains
an issue. More speciﬁcally, the problem consists in ﬁnding a
way to address a speciﬁc IPv6 host using an IPv4 address and
other meta-data available in the packet. In the following we
present different approaches to achieve this goal.

v4/v6 Port Address Translation (v4/v6 PAT). This method
maps arbitrary pairs of IPv4 addresses and TCP/UDP ports
into IPv6 addresses and TCP/UDP ports. It resembles the clas-
sical Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) service
currently supported in many LANs to provide Internet access
to a number of hosts in a private network by sharing a common
public IPv4 address, which is used to address the packets
over the public Internet. When a packet is returned to the
IPv4 common address, the edge router that supports the NATP
service will intercept the packet and replace the common IPv4
destination address with the (private) address of the intended
receiver, which is determined by looking up in the NATP table
the address of the host associated to the speciﬁc destination
port carried by the packet. The same technique can be used
to map multiple IPv6 addresses into a single IPv4 public
address, which allows the forwarding of the datagrams in the
IPv4 network and its correct management at IPv4-only hosts.
The application of this technique requires low complexity
and, indeed, port mapping is an established technique for
v4/v6 transition. On the other hand, this approach raises a
scalability problem, since the number of IPv6 hosts that can
be multiplexed into a single IPv4 address is limited by the
number of available TCP/UDP ports (65535). Furthermore,
this approach requires that the connection be initiated by the
IPv6 nodes in order to create the correct entries in the NATP
look up table. Connections starting from the IPv4 cloud can
also be realized, but this requires a more complex architecture,
with the local DNS placed within the IPv6 network and

6

statically associated to a public IPv4 address in the NATP
translation table.

v4/v6 Domain Name Conversion. This method, originally
proposed in [30], is similar to the technique used to provide
virtual hosting service in HTTP 1.1, which makes it possible to
support multiple websites on the same web server, sharing the
same IPv4 address, by exploiting the information contained
in the HTTP Host header to identify the speciﬁc web site
requested by the user. Similarly, it is possible to program the
DNS servers in such a way that, upon a DNS request for
the domain name of an IoT web service, the DNS returns the
IPv4 address of an HTTP-CoAP cross proxy to be contacted to
access the IoT node. Once addressed by an HTTP request, the
proxy requires the resolution of the domain name contained in
the HTTP Host header to the IPv6 DNS server, which replies
with the IPv6 address that identiﬁes the ﬁnal IoT node involved
in the request. The proxy can then forward the HTTP message
to the intended IoT via CoAP.

URI mapping. The Universal Resource Identiﬁer (URI)
mapping technique is also described in [30]. This technique
involves a particular type of HTTP-CoAP cross proxy, the
reverse cross proxy. This proxy behaves as being the ﬁnal
web server to the HTTP/IPv4 client and as the original client
to the CoAP/IPv6 web server. Since this machine needs to
be placed in a part of the network where IPv6 connectivity is
present to allow direct access to the ﬁnal IoT nodes, IPv4/IPv6
conversion is internally resolved by the applied URI mapping
function.

B. Link Layer Technologies

An urban IoT system, due to its inherently large deployment
area, requires a set of link layer technologies that can easily
cover a wide geographical area and, at the same time, support a
possibly large amount of trafﬁc resulting from the aggregation
of an extremely high number of smaller data ﬂows. For these
reasons, link layer technologies enabling the realization of
an urban IoT system are classiﬁed into unconstrained and
constrained technologies. The ﬁrst group includes all the tra-
ditional LAN, MAN and WAN communication technologies,
such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ﬁber optic, broadband Power Line
Communication (PLC), and cellular technologies as such as
UMTS and LTE. They are generally characterized by high
reliability, low latency, and high transfer rates (order of Mbit/s
or higher), and due to their inherent complexity and energy
consumption are generally not suitable for peripheral IoT
nodes.

The constrained physical and link layer technologies are,
instead, generally characterized by low energy consump-
tion and relatively low transfer rates, typically smaller than
1 Mbit/s. The more prominent solutions in this category
are IEEE 802.15.4 [34], [35] Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low
Energy [36], IEEE 802.11 Low Power, Power Line Commu-
nication (PLC) [37], Near Field Communication (NFC) and
Radio Frequency Identiﬁer (RFID) [38]. These links usually
exhibit
long latencies, mainly due to two factors: (i) the
intrinsically low transmission rate at the physical layer, (ii)
the power saving policies implemented by the nodes to save

energy, which usually involve duty cycling with short active
periods.

C. Devices

We ﬁnally describe the devices that are essential to realize
an urban IoT, classiﬁed based on the position they occupy in
the communication ﬂow.

1) Backend servers: At the root of the system, we ﬁnd
the backend servers, located in the control center, where data
are collected, stored, and processed to produce added-value
services. In principle, backend servers are not mandatory
for an IoT system to properly operate, though they become
a fundamental component of an urban IoT where they can
facilitate the access to the smart city services and open data
through the legacy network infrastructure. Backend systems
commonly considered for interfacing with the IoT data feeders
include the following.

Database Management Systems. These systems are in charge
of storing the large amount of information produced by IoT
peripheral nodes, such as sensors. Depending on the particular
usage scenario, the load on these systems can be quite large,
so that proper dimensioning of the backend system is required.

Web Sites. The widespread acquaintance of people with web
interfaces makes them the ﬁrst option to enable interoperation
between the IoT system and the “data consumers,” e.g., public
authorities, service operators, utility providers, and common
citizens.

Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP). ERP compo-
nents support a variety of business functions and are precious
tools to manage the ﬂow of information across a complex
organization, such as a city administration. Interfacing ERP
components with database management systems that collect
the data generated by the IoT allows for a simpler management
of the potentially massive amount of data gathered by the IoT,
making it possible to separate the information ﬂows based
on their nature and relevance and easing the creation of new
services.

2) Gateways: Moving toward the “edge” of the IoT, we ﬁnd
the gateways, whose role is to interconnect the end devices to
the main communication infrastructure of the system. With
reference to the conceptual protocol architecture depicted in
Fig. 2, the gateway is hence required to provide protocol
translation and functional mapping between the unconstrained
protocols and their constrained counterparts, that is to say
XML-EXI, HTTP-CoAP, IPv4/v6-6LoWPAN.

Note that, while all these translations may be required in
order to enable interoperability with IoT peripheral devices
and control stations, it is not necessary to concentrate all of
them in a single gateway. Rather, it is possible, and sometimes
convenient, to distribute the translation tasks over different
devices in the network. For example, a single HTTP-CoAP
proxy can be deployed to support multiple 6LoWPAN border
routers.

Gateway devices shall also provide the interconnection
between unconstrained link layer technologies, mainly used
in the core of the IoT network, and constrained technologies

7

that, instead, provide connectivity among the IoT peripheral
nodes.

3) IoT peripheral nodes: Finally, at the periphery of the
IoT system we ﬁnd the devices in charge of producing the
data to be delivered to the control center, which are usually
called IoT peripheral nodes or, more simply, IoT nodes.
Generally speaking, the cost of these devices is very low,
starting from 10 USD or even less, depending on the kind and
number of sensors/actuators mounted on the board. IoT nodes
may be classiﬁed based on a wide number of characteristics,
such as powering mode, networking role (relay or leaf), sen-
sor/actuator equipment, supported link layer technologies. The
most constrained IoT nodes are likely the Radio Frequency
tags (RFtags) that, despite their very limited capabilities, can
still play an important role in IoT systems, mainly because
of the extremely low cost and the passive nature of their
communication hardware, which does not require any internal
energy source. The typical application of RFtags is object
identiﬁcation by proximity reading, which can be used for
logistics, maintenance, monitoring, and other services.

Mobile devices, such as smart phones,

tablet PCs, or
laptops, may also be an important part of an urban IoT,
providing other ways to interact with it. For instance, the Near-
Field-Communication (NFC) transceiver integrated in last-
generation smartphones may be used to identify tagged ob-
jects, while the geolocation service provided by most common
operating systems for mobile devices can enrich the context
information associated to that object. Furthermore, mobile
devices can provide access to the IoT in different ways, e.g.,
(i) through an IP connection provided by the cellular data-
link service, or (ii) setting up a direct connection with some
objects by using short-range wireless technologies, such as
Bluetooth Low Energy, low power WiFi, or IEEE 802.15.4.
Furthermore, it is possible to develop speciﬁc applications
for mobile devices that can ease the interaction with the IoT
objects, and with the system as a whole.

IV. AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: PADOVA SMART CITY
The framework discussed in this paper has already been
successfully applied to a number of different use cases in the
context of IoT systems. For instance, the experimental wireless
sensor network testbed, with more than 300 nodes, deployed
at the University of Padova [39], [40] has been designed
according to these guidelines, and successfully used to realize
proof-of-concept demonstrations of smart grid [41], and health
care [42] services.

In this section we describe a practical implementation of
an urban IoT, named “Padova Smart City,” that has been
realized in the city of Padova thanks to the collaboration
between public and private parties, such as the municipality of
Padova, which has sponsored the project, the Department of
Information Engineering of the University of Padova, which
has provided the theoretical background and the feasibility
analysis of the project, and Patavina Technologies s.r.l.,1
a spin-off of the University of Padova specialized in the

development of innovative IoT solutions, which has developed
the IoT nodes and the control software.

The primary goal of Padova Smart City is to promote the
early adoption of open data and ICT solutions in the public
administration. The target application consists of a system for
collecting environmental data and monitoring the public street
lighting by means of wireless nodes, equipped with different
kinds of sensors, placed on street light poles and connected to
the Internet through a gateway unit. This system shall make it
possible to collect interesting environmental parameters, such
as CO level, air temperature and humidity, vibrations, noise,
and so on, while providing a simple but accurate mechanism
to check the correct operation of the public lighting system by
measuring the light intensity at each post. Even if this system
is a simple application of the IoT concept, it still involves a
number of different devices and link layer technologies, thus
being representative of most of the critical issues that need to
be taken care of when designing an urban IoT. A high-level
overview of the types and roles of the devices involved in the
system is given hereafter.

Padova Smart City components. A conceptual sketch of the
Padova Smart City system architecture is given in Fig. 3. In the
following, we describe in more details the different hardware
and software components of the system.

Street light. It is the leaf part of the system where IoT
nodes are placed. Each streetlight is geographically localized
on the city map and uniquely associated to the IoT node
attached to it, so that IoT data can be enhanced with context
information. The monitoring of the correct operation of the
bulbs is performed through photometer sensors that directly
measure the intensity of the light emitted by the lamps (or,
actually, by any source whose light reaches the sensor) at
regular time intervals or upon request. The wireless IoT nodes
are also equipped with temperature and humidity sensors,
which provide data concerning weather conditions, and one
node is also equipped with a benzene (C6H6) sensor, which
monitors air quality. IoT nodes are generally powered by small
batteries, though connection to a low power grid is required

by the benzene sensor. The packaging of the sensor nodes has
been designed by taking into account the speciﬁc requirements
of this use case. Indeed, sensor nodes have been hosted in a
transparent plastic shield that protects the electronic parts from
atmospheric phenomena (like rain or snow), while permitting
the circulation of air and light for the correct measurement of
humidity, temperature, and light intensity.

Constrained link layer technologies. The IoT nodes mounted
on the streetlight poles form a 6LoWPAN multi-hop cloud,
using IEEE 802.15.4 constrained link layer technology. Rout-
ing functionalities are provided by the IPv6 Routing Proto-
col for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [43]. IoT
nodes are assigned unique IPv6 addresses, suitably compressed
according to the 6LoWPAN standard. Each node can be
individually accessible from anywhere in the Internet by means
of IPv6/6LoWPAN. Nodes collectively deliver their data to a
sink node, which represents the single point of contact for
the external nodes. Alternatively, each node might publish
its own features and data by running a CoAP server, though
this feature is not yet implemented in the testbed. In either
case, a gateway is required to bridge the 6LoWPAN cloud to
the Internet and perform all the transcoding described in the
previous section.

WSN Gateway. The gateway has the role of interfacing
the constrained link layer technology used in the sensors
cloud with traditional WAN technologies used to provide
connectivity to the central backend servers. The gateway hence
plays the role of 6LoWPAN border router and RPL root
node. Furthermore, since sensor nodes do not support CoAP
services, the gateway also operates as the sink node for the
sensor cloud, collecting all the data that need to be exported
to the backend services. The connection to the backend ser-
vices is provided by common unconstrained communication
technologies, optical ﬁber in this speciﬁc example.

HTTP-CoAP Proxy. The HTTP-CoAP proxy enables trans-
parent communication with CoAP devices. The proxy logic
can be extended to better support monitoring applications and
limit the amount of trafﬁc injected into the IoT peripheral
is possible to specify a list of
network. For instance,

it

resources that need to be monitored, so that the server can
autonomously update the entries in a cache related to those
devices. This mechanism can be supported by two different
approaches: (i) by polling the selected resource proactively,
thus enabling the implementation of trafﬁc shaping techniques
at the proxy or at the gateway, and (ii) by subscribing to the
selected resource using the “observe” functionality of CoAP,
thus enabling the server on the node to send the updates only
when the value measured by the sensor falls outside a certain
range. This service is co-located on the switchboard gateway in
the Padova Smart City system, though it could also be placed
in the backend servers, thus making it possible to control
multiple gateways by using a single proxy instance.

Database server. The database server collects the state of the
resources that need to be monitored in time by communicating
with the HTTP-CoAP proxy server, which in turn takes care
of retrieving the required data from the proper source. The
data stored in the database are accessible through traditional
web programming technologies. The information can either be
visualized in the form of a web site, or exported in any open
data format using dynamic web programming languages. In
the Padova Smart City network, the database server is realized
within the WSN Gateway, which hence represents a plug-
and-play module that provides a transparent interface with the
peripheral nodes.

Operator mobile device. Public lighting operators will be
equipped with mobile devices that can locate the streetlight
that requires intervention, issue actuation commands directly
to the IoT node connected to the lamp, and signal the result
of the intervention to the central system that can track every
single lamppost and, hence, optimize the maintenance plan.

Such a system can be successively extended to include other
types of IoT nodes or clouds of IoT nodes, provided that
each IoT peripheral system supports an HTTP-based interface,
which makes it possible to interact with it in an open, standard,
and technology independent manner.

A. Example of data collected by Padova Smart City

Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 report an example of the type of data
that can be collected with the Padova Smart City system.
The four plots show the temperature, humidity, light, and
benzene readings over a period of seven days. Thin lines
show the actual readings, while thick lines are obtained by
applying a moving average ﬁlter over a time window of one
hour (approximately 10 readings of temperature, humidity
and light, and 120 readings of the benzene sensor, whose
sampling rate is larger since the node is powered by the
grid). It is possible to observe the regular pattern of the light
measurements, corresponding to day and night periods. In
particular, at daytime the measure reaches the saturation value,
while during nighttime the values are more irregular, due to
the reﬂections produced by vehicle lights. A similar pattern
is exhibited by the humidity and temperature measurements
that, however, are much more noisy than those for light. The
benzene measurements also reveal a decrease of the benzene
levels at nighttime, as expected due to the lighter night trafﬁc,
but quite surprisingly there is no evident variations in the
daytime benzene levels during the week end (Oct. 26-27). It
is also interesting to note the peak of benzene measured in
the early afternoon of Oct. 29. Examining the readings of the
other sensors in the same time interval, we can note a sharp
decrease of light intensity and temperature, and an increase in
humidity. These readings suggest that a quick rainstorm has
temporarily obscured the sunlight, while producing congestion
in the road trafﬁc and, in turn, a peak of benzene in the air.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we analyzed the solutions currently avail-
able for the implementation of urban IoTs. The discussed
technologies are close to being standardized, and industry
players are already active in the production of devices that
take advantage of these technologies to enable the applications
of interest, such as those described in Sec. II. In fact, while
the range of design options for IoT systems is rather wide,
the set of open and standardized protocols is signiﬁcantly

smaller. The enabling technologies, furthermore, have reached
a level of maturity that allows for the practical realization
of IoT solutions and services, starting from ﬁeld trials that
will hopefully help clear the uncertainty that still prevents a
massive adoption of the IoT paradigm. A concrete proof of
concept implementation, deployed in collaboration with the
city of Padova, Italy, has also been described as a relevant
example of application of the IoT paradigm to smart cities.

Abstract—The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incor-
porate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different
and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to
selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of
digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is
hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large
variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may
be involved in such a system. In this paper we focus speciﬁcally to
an urban IoT systems that, while still being quite a broad category,
are characterized by their speciﬁc application domain. Urban
IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which
aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies
to support added-value services for the administration of the city
and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive
survey of the enabling technologies, protocols and architecture for
an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss
the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the
Padova Smart City project, a proof of concept deployment of an
IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration
with the city municipality.

I. INTRODUCTION

T HE IoT is a recent communication paradigm that en-

visions a near future in which the objects of everyday
life will be equipped with micro-controllers, transceivers for
digital communication, and suitable protocol stacks that will
make them able to communicate with one another and with
the users, becoming an integral part of the Internet [1]. The
IoT concept, hence, aims at making the Internet even more im-
mersive and pervasive. Furthermore, by enabling easy access
and interaction with a wide variety of devices such as, for
instance, home appliances, surveillance cameras, monitoring
sensors, actuators, displays, vehicles, and so on, the IoT will
foster the development of a number of applications that make
use of the potentially enormous amount and variety of data

generated by such objects to provide new services to citi-
zens, companies, and public administrations. This paradigm
indeed ﬁnds application in many different domains, such as
home automation, industrial automation, medical aids, mobile
health care, elderly assistance, intelligent energy management
and smart grids, automotive, trafﬁc management and many
others [2].

However, such a heterogeneous ﬁeld of application makes
the identiﬁcation of solutions capable of satisfying the re-
quirements of all possible application scenarios a formidable
challenge. This difﬁculty has led to the proliferation of differ-
ent and, sometimes, incompatible proposals for the practical
realization of IoT systems. Therefore, from a system per-
spective, the realization of an IoT network, together with the
required backend network services and devices, still lacks an
established best practice because of its novelty and complexity.
In addition to the technical difﬁculties, the adoption of the
IoT paradigm is also hindered by the lack of a clear and
widely accepted business model that can attract investments
to promote the deployment of these technologies [3].

the application of

In this complex scenario,

the IoT
paradigm to an urban context is of particular interest as it
responds to the strong push of many national governments
to adopt ICT solutions in the management of public affairs,
thus realizing the so-called Smart City concept [4]. Although
there is not yet a formal and widely accepted deﬁnition of
“Smart City,” the ﬁnal aim is to make a better use of the
public resources, increasing the quality of the services offered
to the citizens while reducing the operational costs of the
public administrations. This objective can be pursued by the
deployment of an urban IoT, i.e., a communication infrastruc-
ture that provides uniﬁed, simple, and economical access to a
plethora of public services, thus unleashing potential synergies
and increasing transparency to the citizens. An urban IoT,
indeed, may bring a number of beneﬁts in the management and
optimization of traditional public services, such as transport
and parking, lighting, surveillance and maintenance of public
areas, preservation of cultural heritage, garbage collection,
salubrity of hospitals and school [5]. Furthermore, the avail-
ability of different types of data, collected by a pervasive
urban IoT, may also be exploited to increase the transparency
and promote the actions of the local government toward the
citizens, enhance the awareness of people about the status of
their city, stimulate the active participation of the citizens in
the management of public administration, and also stimulate
the creation of new services upon those provided by the
IoT [6]. Therefore, the application of the IoT paradigm to
the Smart City is particularly attractive to local and regional
administrations that may become the early adopters of such
technologies, thus acting as catalyzers for the adoption of the

IoT paradigm on a wider scale.

The objective of this paper is to discuss a general reference
framework for the design of an urban IoT. We describe the
speciﬁc characteristics of an urban IoT, and the services that
may drive the adoption of urban IoT by local governments. We
then overview the web-based approach for the design of IoT
services, and the related protocols and technologies, discussing
their suitability for the Smart City environment. Finally, we
substantiate the discussion by reporting our experience in the
“Padova Smart City” project, which is a proof of concept IoT
island deployed in the city of Padova (Italy) and interconnected
with the data network of the city municipality. In this regard,
we describe the technical solutions adopted for the realization
of the IoT island and we report some of the measurements
that have been collected by the system in its ﬁrst operational
days.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Sec. II
overviews the services that are commonly associated to the
Smart City vision and that can be enabled by the deployment
of an urban IoT. Sec. III provides a general overview of the
system architecture for an urban IoT. More in detail, the sec-
tion describes the web service approach for the realization of
IoT services, with the related data formats and communication
protocols, and the link layer technologies. Finally, Sec. IV
presents the “Padova Smart City” project, which exempliﬁes
a possible implementation of an urban IoT, and provides
examples of the type of data that can be collected with such
a structure.

II. SMART CITY CONCEPT AND SERVICES

According to [7], the Smart City market is estimated at
hundreds of billion dollars by 2020, with an annual spending
reaching nearly 16 billions. This market springs from the
synergic interconnection of key industry and service sectors,
such as Smart Governance, Smart Mobility, Smart Utilities,
Smart Buildings, Smart Environment. These sectors have
also been considered in the European Smart Cities project
(http://www.smart-cities.eu) to deﬁne a ranking criterion that
can be used to assess the level of “smartness” of European
cities. Nonetheless, the Smart City market has not really taken
off yet, for a number of political, technical, and ﬁnancial
barriers [8].

Under the political dimension,

the primary obstacle is
the attribution of decision-making power to the different
stakeholders. A possible way to remove this roadblock is
to institutionalize the entire decision and execution process,
concentrating the strategic planning and management of the
smart city aspects into a single, dedicated department in the
city [9].

the most relevant

On the technical side,

issue consists
in the non-interoperability of the heterogeneous technologies
currently used in city and urban developments. In this respect,
the IoT vision can become the building block to realize a
uniﬁed urban-scale ICT platform, thus unleashing the potential
of the Smart City vision [10], [11].

Finally, concerning the ﬁnancial dimension, a clear business
model is still lacking, although some initiative to ﬁll this gap

2

has been recently undertaken [12]. The situation is worsened
by the adverse global economic situation, which has deter-
mined a general shrinking of investments on public services.
This situation prevents the potentially huge Smart City market
from becoming reality. A possible way out of this impasse is to
ﬁrst develop those services that conjugate social utility with
very clear return on investment, such as smart parking and
smart buildings, and will hence act as catalyzers for the other
added-value services [12].

In the rest of this section we overview some of the services
that might be enabled by an urban IoT paradigm and that are
of potential interest in the Smart City context because they
can realize the win-win situation of increasing the quality and
enhancing the services offered to the citizens while bringing
an economical advantage for the city administration in terms
of reduction of the operational costs [8]. To better appreciate
the level of maturity of the enabling technologies for these
services, we report in Tab. I a synoptic view of the services in
terms of suggested type(s) of network to be deployed; expected
trafﬁc generated by the service; maximum tolerable delay;
device powering; and an estimate of the feasibility of each
service with currently available technologies. From the table
it clearly emerges that, in general, the practical realization of
most of such services is not hindered by technical issues, but
rather by the lack of a widely accepted communication and
service architecture that can abstract from the speciﬁc features
of the single technologies and provide harmonized access to
the services.

Structural health of buildings. Proper maintenance of the
historical buildings of a city requires the continuous mon-
itoring of the actual conditions of each building and the
identiﬁcation of the areas that are most subject to the impact
of external agents. The urban IoT may provide a distributed
database of building structural integrity measurements, col-
lected by suitable sensors located in the buildings, such as
vibration and deformation sensors to monitor the building
stress, atmospheric agent sensors in the surrounding areas to
monitor pollution levels, and temperature and humidity sensors
to have a complete characterization of the environmental
conditions [13]. This database should reduce the need for
expensive periodic structural testing by human operators and
will allow targeted and proactive maintenance and restoration
actions. Finally, it will be possible to combine vibration and
seismic readings in order to better study and understand the
impact of light earthquakes on city buildings. This database
can be made publicly accessible in order to make the citizens
aware of the care taken in preserving the city historical
heritage. The practical realization of this service, however,
requires the installation of sensors in the buildings and sur-
rounding areas and their interconnection to a control system,
which may require an initial investment in order to create the
needed infrastructure.

Waste Management. Waste management is a primary issue
in many modern cities, due to both the cost of the service and
the problem of the storage of garbage in landﬁlls. A deeper

penetration of ICT solutions in this domain, however, may
result in signiﬁcant savings and economical and ecological
advantages. For instance, the use of intelligent waste contain-
ers that detect the level of load and allow for an optimization
of the collector trucks route, can reduce the cost of waste
collection and improve the quality of recycling [14], [15]. To
realize such a smart waste management service, the IoT shall
connect the end devices, i.e., intelligent waste containers, to
a control center where an optimization software processes the
data and determines the optimal management of the collector
truck ﬂeet.
Air quality. The European Union ofﬁcially adopted a 20-
20-20 Renewable Energy Directive setting climate change
reduction goals for the next decade [16]. The targets call
for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
2020 compared with 1990 levels, a 20 percent cut in energy
consumption through improved energy efﬁciency by 2020 and
a 20 percent
increase in the use of renewable energy by
2020. To such an extent, an urban IoT can provide means
to monitor the quality of the air in crowded areas, parks or
ﬁtness trails [17]. In addition, communication facilities can be
provided to let health applications running on joggers’ devices
be connected to the infrastructure. In such a way, people can
always ﬁnd the healthiest path for outdoor activities and can
be continuously connected to their preferred personal training
application. The realization of such a service requires that air
quality and pollution sensors be deployed across the city and
that the sensor data be made publicly available to citizens.
Noise monitoring. Noise can be seen as a form of acoustic
pollution as much as carbon oxide (CO) is for air. In that
sense, the city authorities have already issued speciﬁc laws
to reduce the amount of noise in the city centre at speciﬁc
hours. An urban IoT can offer a noise monitoring service
to measure the amount of noise produced at any given hour
in the places that adopt the service [18]. Besides building
a space-time map of the noise pollution in the area, such
a service can also be used to enforce public security, by
means of sound detection algorithms that can recognize, for

instance, the noise of glass crashes or brawls. This service
can hence improve both the quiet of the nights in the city and
the conﬁdence of public establishment owners, although the
installation of sound detectors or environmental microphones
is quite controversial, because of the obvious privacy concerns
for this type of monitoring.
Trafﬁc congestion. On the same line of air quality and noise
monitoring, a possible Smart City service that can be enabled
by urban IoT consists in monitoring the trafﬁc congestion in
the city. Even though camera-based trafﬁc monitoring systems
are already available and deployed in many cities, low-power
widespread communication can provide a denser source of
information. Trafﬁc monitoring may be realized by using the
sensing capabilities and GPS installed on modern vehicles
[19], but also adopting a combination of air quality and
acoustic sensors along a given road. This information is of
great
importance for city authorities and citizens: for the
former to discipline trafﬁc and to send ofﬁcers where needed,
for the latter to plan in advance the route to reach the ofﬁce
or to better schedule a shopping trip to the city centre.
City energy consumption. Together with the air quality
monitoring service, an urban IoT may provide a service
to monitor the energy consumption of the whole city, thus
enabling authorities and citizens to get a clear and detailed
view of the amount of energy required by the different services
(public lighting, transportation, trafﬁc lights, control cameras,
heating/cooling of public buildings, and so on). In turn, this
will make it possible to identify the main energy consumption
sources and to set priorities in order to optimize their behavior.
This goes in the direction indicated by the European directive
for energy efﬁciency improvement in the next years. In order
to obtain such a service, power draw monitoring devices must
be integrated with the power grid in the city. In addition, it
will also be possible to enhance these service with active
functionalities to control local power production structures
(e.g., photovoltaic panels).

Smart parking. The smart parking service is based on road

III. URBAN IOT ARCHITECTURE

From the analysis of the services described in Sec. II, it
clearly emerges that most Smart City services are based on a
centralized architecture, where a dense and heterogeneous set
of peripheral devices deployed over the urban area generate
different types of data that are then delivered through suitable
communication technologies to a control center, where data
storage and processing are performed.

A primary characteristic of an urban IoT infrastructure,
hence, is its capability of integrating different technologies
with the existing communication infrastructures in order to
support a progressive evolution of the IoT, with the in-
terconnection of other devices and the realization of novel
functionalities and services. Another fundamental aspect is the
necessity to make (part of) the data collected by the urban IoT
easily accessible by authorities and citizens, to increase the
responsiveness of authorities to city problems, and promote the
awareness and the participation of citizens in public matters
[11].

In the rest of this section we describe the different compo-
nents of an urban IoT system, as sketched in Fig. 1. We start
describing the web service approach for the design of IoT
services, which requires the deployment of suitable protocol
layers in the different elements of the network, as shown in
the protocol stacks depicted in Fig. 1 besides the key elements
of the architecture. Then, we brieﬂy overview the link layer
technologies that can be used to interconnect the different
parts of the IoT. Finally, we describe the heterogeneous set
of devices that concur to the realization of an urban IoT.

A. Web service approach for IoT service architecture

Although in the IoT many different standards are still
struggling to be the reference one and the most adopted, in this
section we focus speciﬁcally on IETF standards because they
are open and royalty-free, are based on Internet best practices,
and can count on a wide community.

The IETF standards for IoT embrace a web service archi-
tecture for IoT services, which has been widely documented
in the literature as a very promising and ﬂexible approach. In
fact, web services permit to realize a ﬂexible and interoperable
system that can be extended to IoT nodes, through the adoption
of the web-based paradigm known as Representational State
Transfer (ReST) [22]. IoT services designed in accordance
with the ReST paradigm exhibit very strong similarity with
traditional web services, thus greatly facilitating the adoption
and use of IoT by both end users and service developers,
which will be able to easily reuse much of the knowledge
gained from traditional web technologies in the development
of services for networks containing smart objects. The web
service approach is also promoted by international standard-
ization bodies such as IETF, ETSI and W3C, among others, as
well as European research projects on the Internet of Things
such as SENSEI [23], IoT-A [24] and SmartSantander [5].

Fig. 2 shows a reference protocol architecture for the
urban IoT system that entails both an unconstrained and a
constrained protocol stack. The ﬁrst consists of the protocols

service approach.

sensors and intelligent displays that direct motorists along the
best path for parking in the city [20]. The beneﬁts deriving
from this service are manifold: faster time to locate a parking
slot means fewer CO emission from the car,
less trafﬁc
congestion, and happier citizens. The smart parking service
can be directly integrated in the urban IoT infrastructure,
because many companies in Europe are providing market
products for this application. Furthermore, by using short-
range communication technologies, such as Radio Frequency
Identiﬁers (RFID) or Near Field Communication (NFC), it is
possible to realize an electronic veriﬁcation system of parking
permits in slots reserved for residents or disabled, thus offering
a better service to citizens that can legitimately use those slots
and an efﬁcient tool for quickly spot violations.

Smart lighting. In order to support the 202020 directive, the
optimization of the street lighting efﬁciency is an important
feature. In particular,
this service can optimize the street
lamp intensity according to the time of the day, the weather
conditions and the presence of people. In order to properly
work, such a service needs to include the street lights into
the Smart City infrastructure. It is also possible to exploit
the increased number of connected spots to provide WiFi
connection to citizens. In addition, a fault detection system
will be easily realized on top of the street light controllers.

Automation and salubrity of public buildings. Another
important application of IoT technologies is the monitoring of
the energy consumption and the salubrity of the environment
in public buildings (schools, administration ofﬁces, museums)
by means of different types of sensors and actuators that
control lights, temperature, and humidity. By controlling these
parameters,
is possible to enhance the level of
comfort of the persons that live in these environments, which
may also have a positive return in terms of productivity, while
reducing the costs for heating/cooling [21].

EXI processors share an XML Schema before actual encoding
and decoding can take place. This shared schema makes it
possible to assign numeric identiﬁers to the XML tags in the
schema and build the EXI grammars upon such coding. As
discussed in [27], a general purpose schema-informed EXI
processor can be easily integrated even in very constrained
devices, enabling them to interpret EXI formats and, hence,
making it possible to build multi-purpose IoT nodes even
out of very constrained devices. Using the schema-informed
approach, however, requires additional care in the development
of higher layer application, since developers need to deﬁne an
XML Schema for the messages involved in the application and
use EXI processors that support this operating mode. Further
details about EXI and schema-informed processing can be
found in [27].

Integration of multiple XML/EXI data sources into an IoT
system can be obtained by using the databases typically
created and maintained by high-level applications. In fact, IoT
applications generally build a database of the nodes controlled
by the application and, often, of the data generated by such
nodes. The database makes it possible to integrate the data
received by any IoT device to provide the speciﬁc service
the application is built for. A generic framework for building
IoT web applications according to the guidelines described
in this section has been proposed in [28], where the authors
also suggest exploiting the Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
(AJAX) capabilities of modern web browsers that allow for a
direct communication between the browser and the ﬁnal IoT
node, demonstrating the full internetworking of the protocol
stack and the open data nature of the proposed approach.

2) Application and transport layers: Most of the trafﬁc that
crosses the Internet today is carried at the application layer by
HTTP over TCP. However, the verbosity and complexity of
native HTTP make it unsuitable for a straight deployment on
constrained IoT devices. For such an environment, in fact, the
human-readable format of HTTP, which has been one of the
reasons of its success in traditional networks, turns out to be
a limiting factor due to the large amount of heavily correlated
(and, hence, redundant) data. Moreover, HTTP typically relies
upon the TCP transport protocol that, however, does not scale
well on constrained devices, yielding poor performance for
small data ﬂows in lossy environments.

The CoAP protocol [29] overcomes these difﬁculties by
proposing a binary format transported over UDP, handling
only the retransmissions strictly required to provide a reliable
service. Moreover, CoAP can easily interoperate with HTTP
because: (i) it supports the ReST methods of HTTP (GET,
PUT, POST, and DELETE), (ii) there is a one-to-one corre-
spondence between the response codes of the two protocols,
and (iii) the CoAP options can support a wide range of HTTP
usage scenarios.

Even though regular Internet hosts can natively support
CoAP to directly talk to IoT devices, the most general and
easily interoperable solution requires the deployment of an
HTTP-CoAP intermediary, also known as cross proxy, that
can straightforwardly translate requests/responses between the
two protocols, thus enabling transparent interoperation with
native HTTP devices and applications [30].

nodes.

Protocol stacks for unconstrained (left) and constrained (right) IoT

that are currently the de-facto standards for Internet communi-
cations, and are commonly used by regular Internet hosts, such
as XML, HTTP, and IPv4. These protocols are mirrored in
the constrained protocol stack by their low-complexity coun-
terparts, i.e., the Efﬁcient XML Interchange (EXI), the Con-
strained Application Protocol (CoAP), and 6LoWPAN, which
are suitable even for very constrained devices. The transcoding
operations between the protocols in the left and right stacks
in Fig. 2 can be performed in a standard and low complexity
manner, thus guaranteeing easy access and interoperability of
the IoT nodes with the Internet. It may be worth remarking that
systems that do not adopt the EXI/CoAP/6LoWPAN protocol
stack can still be seamlessly included in the urban IoT system,
provided that they are capable of interfacing with all the layers
of the left-hand side of the protocol architecture in Fig. 2.

In the protocol architecture shown in Fig. 2 we can dis-
tinguish three distinct functional layers, namely (i) Data, (ii)
Application/Transport, and (iii) Network,
that may require
dedicated entities to operate the transcoding between con-
strained and unconstrained formats and protocols. In the rest
of this section, we specify in greater detail the requirements
at each of the three functional layers in order to guarantee
interoperability among the different parts of the system.

1) Data format: As mentioned, the urban IoT paradigm
sets speciﬁc requirements in terms of data accessibility. In
architectures based on web services, data exchange is typically
accompanied by a description of the transferred content by
means of semantic representation languages, of which the
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is probably the most
common. Nevertheless, the size of XML messages is often too
large for the limited capacity of typical devices for the IoT.
Furthermore, the text nature of XML representation makes the
parsing of messages by CPU-limited devices more complex
compared to the binary formats. For these reasons, the working
group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [25] has
proposed the EXI format [26], which makes it possible even
for very constrained devices to natively support and generate
messages using an open data format compatible with XML.
EXI deﬁnes two types of encoding, namely schema-less
and schema-informed. While the schema-less encoding is
generated directly from the XML data and can be decoded
by any EXI entity without any prior knowledge about the
data, the schema-informed encoding assumes that the two

ogy supported by Internet hosts. However, IANA, the interna-
tional organization that assigns IP addresses at a global level,
has recently announced the exhaustion of IPv4 address blocks.
IoT networks, in turn, are expected to include billions of nodes,
each of which shall be (in principle) uniquely addressable. A
solution to this problem is offered by the IPv6 standard [31],
which provides a 128-bit address ﬁeld, thus making it possible
to assign a unique IPv6 address to any possible node in the
IoT network.

While, on the one hand, the huge address space of IPv6
makes it possible to solve the addressing issues in IoT, on
the other hand it introduces overheads that are not compat-
ible with the scarce capabilities of constrained nodes. This
problem can be overcome by adopting 6LoWPAN [32] [33],
which is an established compression format for IPv6 and
UDP headers over low-power constrained networks. A border
router, that is a device directly attached to the 6LoWPAN net-
work, transparently performs the conversion between IPv6 and
6LoWPAN, translating any IPv6 packet intended for a node in
the 6LoWPAN network into a packet with 6LoWPAN header
compression format, and operating the inverse translation in
the opposite direction.

While the deployment of a 6LoWPAN border router enables
transparent interaction between IoT nodes and any IPv6 host
in the Internet, the interaction with IPv4-only hosts remains
an issue. More speciﬁcally, the problem consists in ﬁnding a
way to address a speciﬁc IPv6 host using an IPv4 address and
other meta-data available in the packet. In the following we
present different approaches to achieve this goal.

v4/v6 Port Address Translation (v4/v6 PAT). This method
maps arbitrary pairs of IPv4 addresses and TCP/UDP ports
into IPv6 addresses and TCP/UDP ports. It resembles the clas-
sical Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) service
currently supported in many LANs to provide Internet access
to a number of hosts in a private network by sharing a common
public IPv4 address, which is used to address the packets
over the public Internet. When a packet is returned to the
IPv4 common address, the edge router that supports the NATP
service will intercept the packet and replace the common IPv4
destination address with the (private) address of the intended
receiver, which is determined by looking up in the NATP table
the address of the host associated to the speciﬁc destination
port carried by the packet. The same technique can be used
to map multiple IPv6 addresses into a single IPv4 public
address, which allows the forwarding of the datagrams in the
IPv4 network and its correct management at IPv4-only hosts.
The application of this technique requires low complexity
and, indeed, port mapping is an established technique for
v4/v6 transition. On the other hand, this approach raises a
scalability problem, since the number of IPv6 hosts that can
be multiplexed into a single IPv4 address is limited by the
number of available TCP/UDP ports (65535). Furthermore,
this approach requires that the connection be initiated by the
IPv6 nodes in order to create the correct entries in the NATP
look up table. Connections starting from the IPv4 cloud can
also be realized, but this requires a more complex architecture,
with the local DNS placed within the IPv6 network and

6

statically associated to a public IPv4 address in the NATP
translation table.

v4/v6 Domain Name Conversion. This method, originally
proposed in [30], is similar to the technique used to provide
virtual hosting service in HTTP 1.1, which makes it possible to
support multiple websites on the same web server, sharing the
same IPv4 address, by exploiting the information contained
in the HTTP Host header to identify the speciﬁc web site
requested by the user. Similarly, it is possible to program the
DNS servers in such a way that, upon a DNS request for
the domain name of an IoT web service, the DNS returns the
IPv4 address of an HTTP-CoAP cross proxy to be contacted to
access the IoT node. Once addressed by an HTTP request, the
proxy requires the resolution of the domain name contained in
the HTTP Host header to the IPv6 DNS server, which replies
with the IPv6 address that identiﬁes the ﬁnal IoT node involved
in the request. The proxy can then forward the HTTP message
to the intended IoT via CoAP.

URI mapping. The Universal Resource Identiﬁer (URI)
mapping technique is also described in [30]. This technique
involves a particular type of HTTP-CoAP cross proxy, the
reverse cross proxy. This proxy behaves as being the ﬁnal
web server to the HTTP/IPv4 client and as the original client
to the CoAP/IPv6 web server. Since this machine needs to
be placed in a part of the network where IPv6 connectivity is
present to allow direct access to the ﬁnal IoT nodes, IPv4/IPv6
conversion is internally resolved by the applied URI mapping
function.

B. Link Layer Technologies

An urban IoT system, due to its inherently large deployment
area, requires a set of link layer technologies that can easily
cover a wide geographical area and, at the same time, support a
possibly large amount of trafﬁc resulting from the aggregation
of an extremely high number of smaller data ﬂows. For these
reasons, link layer technologies enabling the realization of
an urban IoT system are classiﬁed into unconstrained and
constrained technologies. The ﬁrst group includes all the tra-
ditional LAN, MAN and WAN communication technologies,
such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ﬁber optic, broadband Power Line
Communication (PLC), and cellular technologies as such as
UMTS and LTE. They are generally characterized by high
reliability, low latency, and high transfer rates (order of Mbit/s
or higher), and due to their inherent complexity and energy
consumption are generally not suitable for peripheral IoT
nodes.

The constrained physical and link layer technologies are,
instead, generally characterized by low energy consump-
tion and relatively low transfer rates, typically smaller than
1 Mbit/s. The more prominent solutions in this category
are IEEE 802.15.4 [34], [35] Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low
Energy [36], IEEE 802.11 Low Power, Power Line Commu-
nication (PLC) [37], Near Field Communication (NFC) and
Radio Frequency Identiﬁer (RFID) [38]. These links usually
exhibit
long latencies, mainly due to two factors: (i) the
intrinsically low transmission rate at the physical layer, (ii)
the power saving policies implemented by the nodes to save

energy, which usually involve duty cycling with short active
periods.

C. Devices

We ﬁnally describe the devices that are essential to realize
an urban IoT, classiﬁed based on the position they occupy in
the communication ﬂow.

1) Backend servers: At the root of the system, we ﬁnd
the backend servers, located in the control center, where data
are collected, stored, and processed to produce added-value
services. In principle, backend servers are not mandatory
for an IoT system to properly operate, though they become
a fundamental component of an urban IoT where they can
facilitate the access to the smart city services and open data
through the legacy network infrastructure. Backend systems
commonly considered for interfacing with the IoT data feeders
include the following.

Database Management Systems. These systems are in charge
of storing the large amount of information produced by IoT
peripheral nodes, such as sensors. Depending on the particular
usage scenario, the load on these systems can be quite large,
so that proper dimensioning of the backend system is required.

Web Sites. The widespread acquaintance of people with web
interfaces makes them the ﬁrst option to enable interoperation
between the IoT system and the “data consumers,” e.g., public
authorities, service operators, utility providers, and common
citizens.

Enterprise Resource Planning systems (ERP). ERP compo-
nents support a variety of business functions and are precious
tools to manage the ﬂow of information across a complex
organization, such as a city administration. Interfacing ERP
components with database management systems that collect
the data generated by the IoT allows for a simpler management
of the potentially massive amount of data gathered by the IoT,
making it possible to separate the information ﬂows based
on their nature and relevance and easing the creation of new
services.

2) Gateways: Moving toward the “edge” of the IoT, we ﬁnd
the gateways, whose role is to interconnect the end devices to
the main communication infrastructure of the system. With
reference to the conceptual protocol architecture depicted in
Fig. 2, the gateway is hence required to provide protocol
translation and functional mapping between the unconstrained
protocols and their constrained counterparts, that is to say
XML-EXI, HTTP-CoAP, IPv4/v6-6LoWPAN.

Note that, while all these translations may be required in
order to enable interoperability with IoT peripheral devices
and control stations, it is not necessary to concentrate all of
them in a single gateway. Rather, it is possible, and sometimes
convenient, to distribute the translation tasks over different
devices in the network. For example, a single HTTP-CoAP
proxy can be deployed to support multiple 6LoWPAN border
routers.

Gateway devices shall also provide the interconnection
between unconstrained link layer technologies, mainly used
in the core of the IoT network, and constrained technologies

7

that, instead, provide connectivity among the IoT peripheral
nodes.

3) IoT peripheral nodes: Finally, at the periphery of the
IoT system we ﬁnd the devices in charge of producing the
data to be delivered to the control center, which are usually
called IoT peripheral nodes or, more simply, IoT nodes.
Generally speaking, the cost of these devices is very low,
starting from 10 USD or even less, depending on the kind and
number of sensors/actuators mounted on the board. IoT nodes
may be classiﬁed based on a wide number of characteristics,
such as powering mode, networking role (relay or leaf), sen-
sor/actuator equipment, supported link layer technologies. The
most constrained IoT nodes are likely the Radio Frequency
tags (RFtags) that, despite their very limited capabilities, can
still play an important role in IoT systems, mainly because
of the extremely low cost and the passive nature of their
communication hardware, which does not require any internal
energy source. The typical application of RFtags is object
identiﬁcation by proximity reading, which can be used for
logistics, maintenance, monitoring, and other services.

Mobile devices, such as smart phones,

tablet PCs, or
laptops, may also be an important part of an urban IoT,
providing other ways to interact with it. For instance, the Near-
Field-Communication (NFC) transceiver integrated in last-
generation smartphones may be used to identify tagged ob-
jects, while the geolocation service provided by most common
operating systems for mobile devices can enrich the context
information associated to that object. Furthermore, mobile
devices can provide access to the IoT in different ways, e.g.,
(i) through an IP connection provided by the cellular data-
link service, or (ii) setting up a direct connection with some
objects by using short-range wireless technologies, such as
Bluetooth Low Energy, low power WiFi, or IEEE 802.15.4.
Furthermore, it is possible to develop speciﬁc applications
for mobile devices that can ease the interaction with the IoT
objects, and with the system as a whole.

IV. AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY: PADOVA SMART CITY
The framework discussed in this paper has already been
successfully applied to a number of different use cases in the
context of IoT systems. For instance, the experimental wireless
sensor network testbed, with more than 300 nodes, deployed
at the University of Padova [39], [40] has been designed
according to these guidelines, and successfully used to realize
proof-of-concept demonstrations of smart grid [41], and health
care [42] services.

In this section we describe a practical implementation of
an urban IoT, named “Padova Smart City,” that has been
realized in the city of Padova thanks to the collaboration
between public and private parties, such as the municipality of
Padova, which has sponsored the project, the Department of
Information Engineering of the University of Padova, which
has provided the theoretical background and the feasibility
analysis of the project, and Patavina Technologies s.r.l.,1
a spin-off of the University of Padova specialized in the

development of innovative IoT solutions, which has developed
the IoT nodes and the control software.

The primary goal of Padova Smart City is to promote the
early adoption of open data and ICT solutions in the public
administration. The target application consists of a system for
collecting environmental data and monitoring the public street
lighting by means of wireless nodes, equipped with different
kinds of sensors, placed on street light poles and connected to
the Internet through a gateway unit. This system shall make it
possible to collect interesting environmental parameters, such
as CO level, air temperature and humidity, vibrations, noise,
and so on, while providing a simple but accurate mechanism
to check the correct operation of the public lighting system by
measuring the light intensity at each post. Even if this system
is a simple application of the IoT concept, it still involves a
number of different devices and link layer technologies, thus
being representative of most of the critical issues that need to
be taken care of when designing an urban IoT. A high-level
overview of the types and roles of the devices involved in the
system is given hereafter.

Padova Smart City components. A conceptual sketch of the
Padova Smart City system architecture is given in Fig. 3. In the
following, we describe in more details the different hardware
and software components of the system.

Street light. It is the leaf part of the system where IoT
nodes are placed. Each streetlight is geographically localized
on the city map and uniquely associated to the IoT node
attached to it, so that IoT data can be enhanced with context
information. The monitoring of the correct operation of the
bulbs is performed through photometer sensors that directly
measure the intensity of the light emitted by the lamps (or,
actually, by any source whose light reaches the sensor) at
regular time intervals or upon request. The wireless IoT nodes
are also equipped with temperature and humidity sensors,
which provide data concerning weather conditions, and one
node is also equipped with a benzene (C6H6) sensor, which
monitors air quality. IoT nodes are generally powered by small
batteries, though connection to a low power grid is required

by the benzene sensor. The packaging of the sensor nodes has
been designed by taking into account the speciﬁc requirements
of this use case. Indeed, sensor nodes have been hosted in a
transparent plastic shield that protects the electronic parts from
atmospheric phenomena (like rain or snow), while permitting
the circulation of air and light for the correct measurement of
humidity, temperature, and light intensity.

Constrained link layer technologies. The IoT nodes mounted
on the streetlight poles form a 6LoWPAN multi-hop cloud,
using IEEE 802.15.4 constrained link layer technology. Rout-
ing functionalities are provided by the IPv6 Routing Proto-
col for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) [43]. IoT
nodes are assigned unique IPv6 addresses, suitably compressed
according to the 6LoWPAN standard. Each node can be
individually accessible from anywhere in the Internet by means
of IPv6/6LoWPAN. Nodes collectively deliver their data to a
sink node, which represents the single point of contact for
the external nodes. Alternatively, each node might publish
its own features and data by running a CoAP server, though
this feature is not yet implemented in the testbed. In either
case, a gateway is required to bridge the 6LoWPAN cloud to
the Internet and perform all the transcoding described in the
previous section.

WSN Gateway. The gateway has the role of interfacing
the constrained link layer technology used in the sensors
cloud with traditional WAN technologies used to provide
connectivity to the central backend servers. The gateway hence
plays the role of 6LoWPAN border router and RPL root
node. Furthermore, since sensor nodes do not support CoAP
services, the gateway also operates as the sink node for the
sensor cloud, collecting all the data that need to be exported
to the backend services. The connection to the backend ser-
vices is provided by common unconstrained communication
technologies, optical ﬁber in this speciﬁc example.

HTTP-CoAP Proxy. The HTTP-CoAP proxy enables trans-
parent communication with CoAP devices. The proxy logic
can be extended to better support monitoring applications and
limit the amount of trafﬁc injected into the IoT peripheral
is possible to specify a list of
network. For instance,

it

resources that need to be monitored, so that the server can
autonomously update the entries in a cache related to those
devices. This mechanism can be supported by two different
approaches: (i) by polling the selected resource proactively,
thus enabling the implementation of trafﬁc shaping techniques
at the proxy or at the gateway, and (ii) by subscribing to the
selected resource using the “observe” functionality of CoAP,
thus enabling the server on the node to send the updates only
when the value measured by the sensor falls outside a certain
range. This service is co-located on the switchboard gateway in
the Padova Smart City system, though it could also be placed
in the backend servers, thus making it possible to control
multiple gateways by using a single proxy instance.

Database server. The database server collects the state of the
resources that need to be monitored in time by communicating
with the HTTP-CoAP proxy server, which in turn takes care
of retrieving the required data from the proper source. The
data stored in the database are accessible through traditional
web programming technologies. The information can either be
visualized in the form of a web site, or exported in any open
data format using dynamic web programming languages. In
the Padova Smart City network, the database server is realized
within the WSN Gateway, which hence represents a plug-
and-play module that provides a transparent interface with the
peripheral nodes.

Operator mobile device. Public lighting operators will be
equipped with mobile devices that can locate the streetlight
that requires intervention, issue actuation commands directly
to the IoT node connected to the lamp, and signal the result
of the intervention to the central system that can track every
single lamppost and, hence, optimize the maintenance plan.

Such a system can be successively extended to include other
types of IoT nodes or clouds of IoT nodes, provided that
each IoT peripheral system supports an HTTP-based interface,
which makes it possible to interact with it in an open, standard,
and technology independent manner.

A. Example of data collected by Padova Smart City

Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 report an example of the type of data
that can be collected with the Padova Smart City system.
The four plots show the temperature, humidity, light, and
benzene readings over a period of seven days. Thin lines
show the actual readings, while thick lines are obtained by
applying a moving average ﬁlter over a time window of one
hour (approximately 10 readings of temperature, humidity
and light, and 120 readings of the benzene sensor, whose
sampling rate is larger since the node is powered by the
grid). It is possible to observe the regular pattern of the light
measurements, corresponding to day and night periods. In
particular, at daytime the measure reaches the saturation value,
while during nighttime the values are more irregular, due to
the reﬂections produced by vehicle lights. A similar pattern
is exhibited by the humidity and temperature measurements
that, however, are much more noisy than those for light. The
benzene measurements also reveal a decrease of the benzene
levels at nighttime, as expected due to the lighter night trafﬁc,
but quite surprisingly there is no evident variations in the
daytime benzene levels during the week end (Oct. 26-27). It
is also interesting to note the peak of benzene measured in
the early afternoon of Oct. 29. Examining the readings of the
other sensors in the same time interval, we can note a sharp
decrease of light intensity and temperature, and an increase in
humidity. These readings suggest that a quick rainstorm has
temporarily obscured the sunlight, while producing congestion
in the road trafﬁc and, in turn, a peak of benzene in the air.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we analyzed the solutions currently avail-
able for the implementation of urban IoTs. The discussed
technologies are close to being standardized, and industry
players are already active in the production of devices that
take advantage of these technologies to enable the applications
of interest, such as those described in Sec. II. In fact, while
the range of design options for IoT systems is rather wide,
the set of open and standardized protocols is signiﬁcantly

smaller. The enabling technologies, furthermore, have reached
a level of maturity that allows for the practical realization
of IoT solutions and services, starting from ﬁeld trials that
will hopefully help clear the uncertainty that still prevents a
massive adoption of the IoT paradigm. A concrete proof of
concept implementation, deployed in collaboration with the
city of Padova, Italy, has also been described as a relevant
example of application of the IoT paradigm to smart cities.
