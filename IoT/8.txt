Abstract 

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new evolution in technological advancement taking place 
in  the  world  today.  This  paradigm  allows  physical  world  objects  in  our  surroundings  to  be 
connected  to  the  Internet.  This  idea  comes  to  life  by  utilizing  two  architecture;  the  Sensing 
Entity  in  the  environment  that  collects  data  and  connects  itself  to  the  cloud  and  the  Cloud 
Service  that  hosts  the  data  from  the  environment.  The  combination  of  wireless  sensor 
networks and cloud computing is becoming a popular strategy for the IoT era. The cold chain 
requires controlled environment for sensitive products in order for them to be fit for use. The 
monitoring process is the only assurance which tells if a certain process has been carried out 
successfully.  Taking  advantage  of  IoT  and  its  benefits  to  monitor  cold  chain  logistics  will 
result in better management and product handling. This paper looks at a system comprising

In [11], the authors describe a design and development of a Flexible Tag Datalogger (FTD) 
to improve food and goods logistics during transportation, storage and vending. The device is 
composed  of  three  sensors  (temperature,  humidity  and  light)  and  a  microcontroller.  The

a  temperature  monitoring  solution  at  the  box  level  in  the  fish  supply  chain  as  part  of  the 
traceability system implemented using RFID technology. The temperature is measured in two 
ways; RFID data loggers are placed inside the box to measure temperature of the product and

Work in [14] also looked at the performance of ZigBee motes through experiments under 
real  conditions. The  objective  of  the  experiment  was to test  wireless sensor  motes  based  on 
the  ZigBee/IEEE  802.15.4  protocol  during  shipment  of  refrigerated  vegetables.  The 
experiment  was  conducted  in  a  refrigerated  truck  travelling  through  Spain  and  France.  The 
paper  illustrated  great  potential  of  this  type  of  motes  that  could  provide  information  about 
several parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, opening of doors and truck stops. 
 
2.2. Technologies in this Work 
 
2.2.1. Internet of Things: In the beginning, the Internet was designed only for computers so 
that  they  could  access  websites,  download  contents  or  communicate  with  other  computers. 
The evolution of technology resulted in surfacing of powerful and faster devices with higher 
capabilities. With this evolution was the advancement of electronics technology that resulted 
in  development  of  smaller  devices  which  had  high  processing  capabilities  and  low  power 
consumption.  Due  to  these  devices,  large  networks  of  sensors  can  be  created,  having  the 
ability to obtain and process information and act accordingly. This idea of connecting objects 
or things to the Internet goes back a few decades. The early inventions of such devices were a 
toaster by John Romkey and Simon Hackett and a coffee pot by Quentin Stafford-Fraser and 
Paul Jardetzky in 1989 and 1992 respectively [15,16]. The term ‘Internet of Things’ was later 
coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999,  the director of MIT Auto-ID center, with the concept that 
computers  could  get  information  about  the  real  world  without  any  help  from  people  and 
giving information [17]. 
 
2.2.2. Arduino: Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform that is based on 
easy-to-use hardware and software. It is a board based platform with a single microcontroller 
input/output  pin  for  communication  and  control  of  physical  objects  and  a  development 
environment  for  writing  algorithms  for  the  board.  The  platform  grew  largely  out  of  “Do  It 
Yourself”  situation  created  by  the  proliferating  popularity  of  rapid  prototyping  boards  like 
PIC and Wiring, as well as the response to the growing needs of artists and designers to easily 
prototype  interactive  works  [18].  The  Arduino  devices  have  been  developed  to  connect  all 
sorts of objects and its functionality directly relates it to IoT. 
 
2.2.3. Web 2.0: Web 2.0 is the second generation World Wide Web that is focused on people 
to  have  the  ability  to  collaborate  and  share  information  online.  Formerly,  users  could  only 
view  or  download  data  contents  posted  on  websites  but  with  this  new  web,  the  users  have 
more  input into  the  nature and  scope  of  the  web contents and in  some  situations  exert real-
time control over it.  
 
2.2.4.  Mobile  Data  Network:  3G  mobile  data  network  is  the  result  of  a  decade  of 
development  and  evolution  of  GSM  standard  to  support  increased  data  needs.  It  allows 
network  operators  to  provide  its  users  a  bigger  range  of  services  due  to  bigger  network 
capacity  via  heightened  spectral  efficiency.  The  network  covers  a  wide  area  of  cellular 
telephone networks which incorporates high-speed Internet connection and video telephony. 
 
2.2.5.  Near  field  Communication:  Near  Field  Communication  (NFC)  is  a  wireless 
communication protocol which enables short-range communication between devices through 
high frequency to exchange data. Its root traces back to radio frequency identification (RFID). 
It is based on radio waves where data is exchanged between an identification card (NFC card) 
and a reader when brought together to a distance of about 4 centimeters.

producer  cellar  for  shop.  When  bottles  arrive  at  the  shop,  the  FTD  attached  to  them 
downloads the data and is analyzed by PDA.   

Performance of ZigBee-Based wireless sensor nodes has been studied in [12] for real-time 
monitoring  of  fruit  logistics.  WSNs  are  a  promising  solution  to  the  monitoring  applications 
and  this  work  explores  the  potential  of  this  technology  for  monitoring  fruit  in  storage  and 
transportation conditions. It focuses on two different commercial modules of ZigBee, Xbow 
and  Xbee.  The  experiments  were  carried  out  in  experimental  refrigerated  chambers  and  the 
remainders  in  a  commercial  store.  The  main  parameters  considered  were  the  ratio  of 
measurement losses (%), battery life (minimum) and the influence of node location and on/off 
operation of the cooling system.   

Radio  frequency  identification  (RFID)  is  an  innovative  and  renowned  technology  that 
supports all types of traceability systems in many different areas and the work in [13] presents 
a  temperature  monitoring  solution  at  the  box  level  in  the  fish  supply  chain  as  part  of  the 
traceability system implemented using RFID technology. The temperature is measured in two 
ways; RFID data loggers are placed inside the box to measure temperature of the product and 
on  the  box to  measure the ambient temperature.  Sensor  data  is available  immediately  at the

Work in [14] also looked at the performance of ZigBee motes through experiments under 
real  conditions. The  objective  of  the  experiment  was to test  wireless sensor  motes  based  on 
the  ZigBee/IEEE  802.15.4  protocol  during  shipment  of  refrigerated  vegetables.  The 
experiment  was  conducted  in  a  refrigerated  truck  travelling  through  Spain  and  France.  The 
paper  illustrated  great  potential  of  this  type  of  motes  that  could  provide  information  about 
several parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, opening of doors and truck stops.

2.2.1. Internet of Things: In the beginning, the Internet was designed only for computers so 
that  they  could  access  websites,  download  contents  or  communicate  with  other  computers. 
The evolution of technology resulted in surfacing of powerful and faster devices with higher 
capabilities. With this evolution was the advancement of electronics technology that resulted 
in  development  of  smaller  devices  which  had  high  processing  capabilities  and  low  power 
consumption.  Due  to  these  devices,  large  networks  of  sensors  can  be  created,  having  the 
ability to obtain and process information and act accordingly. This idea of connecting objects 
or things to the Internet goes back a few decades. The early inventions of such devices were a 
toaster by John Romkey and Simon Hackett and a coffee pot by Quentin Stafford-Fraser and 
Paul Jardetzky in 1989 and 1992 respectively [15,16]. The term ‘Internet of Things’ was later 
coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999,  the director of MIT Auto-ID center, with the concept that 
computers  could  get  information  about  the  real  world  without  any  help  from  people  and 
giving information [17]. 
 
2.2.2. Arduino: Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform that is based on 
easy-to-use hardware and software. It is a board based platform with a single microcontroller 
input/output  pin  for  communication  and  control  of  physical  objects  and  a  development 
environment  for  writing  algorithms  for  the  board.  The  platform  grew  largely  out  of  “Do  It 
Yourself”  situation  created  by  the  proliferating  popularity  of  rapid  prototyping  boards  like 
PIC and Wiring, as well as the response to the growing needs of artists and designers to easily 
prototype  interactive  works  [18].  The  Arduino  devices  have  been  developed  to  connect  all 
sorts of objects and its functionality directly relates it to IoT. 
 
2.2.3. Web 2.0: Web 2.0 is the second generation World Wide Web that is focused on people 
to  have  the  ability  to  collaborate  and  share  information  online.  Formerly,  users  could  only 
view  or  download  data  contents  posted  on  websites  but  with  this  new  web,  the  users  have 
more  input into  the  nature and  scope  of  the  web contents and in  some  situations  exert real-
time control over it.  
 
2.2.4.  Mobile  Data  Network:  3G  mobile  data  network  is  the  result  of  a  decade  of 
development  and  evolution  of  GSM  standard  to  support  increased  data  needs.  It  allows 
network  operators  to  provide  its  users  a  bigger  range  of  services  due  to  bigger  network

Abstract 

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new evolution in technological advancement taking place 
in  the  world  today.  This  paradigm  allows  physical  world  objects  in  our  surroundings  to  be 
connected  to  the  Internet.  This  idea  comes  to  life  by  utilizing  two  architecture;  the  Sensing 
Entity  in  the  environment  that  collects  data  and  connects  itself  to  the  cloud  and  the  Cloud 
Service  that  hosts  the  data  from  the  environment.  The  combination  of  wireless  sensor 
networks and cloud computing is becoming a popular strategy for the IoT era. The cold chain 
requires controlled environment for sensitive products in order for them to be fit for use. The 
monitoring process is the only assurance which tells if a certain process has been carried out 
successfully.  Taking  advantage  of  IoT  and  its  benefits  to  monitor  cold  chain  logistics  will 
result in better management and product handling. This paper looks at a system comprising 
of Arduino wireless sensor network and Xively sensor cloud which can be an ideal system to 
monitor temperature and humidity of cold chain logistics.

1. Introduction 

Cold Chain logistics refers to the transportation of pharmaceutical products, biologics and 
active  ingredients  in  controlled  temperature  environment.  These  temperature  sensitive  items 
require such environment to the very last stage of the cold chain so that they do not lose their 
potency and is fit for use or consumption. This applies to both high-risk and low-risk products 
such as insulins, vaccines and blood products [1]. The counterfeit products are a real threat to 
public health and safety [2]. 

In  the  early  1990’s,  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  and  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture  (USDA)  began  to  convey  the  Hazard  Analysis  Critical  Control  Point  (HACCP) 
rules as a systematic approach to food safety [3]. The same principle has now been applied to 
other  industries  dealing  with  temperature  sensitive  products  such  as  the  pharmaceutical 
industry.  The  HACCP  management  system  addresses  various  circumstances  for  product 
safety and among them is the handling and distribution of the finished product. HACCP has 
become universally recognized and accepted standard for product safety and has been adopted 
by  the  WHO  Standards  Programme  [4].  At  every  point  in  the  cold  chain,  precautions  are 
taken to ensure that the external conditions do not have any effect on the quality and stability 
of  the  products.  Records  of  essential  parameters  such  as  temperature  and  humidity  are 
maintained to provide evidence of compliance with recommended storage conditions. 

The IoT technology ties the physical world objects to the Internet and gives the flexibility 
to easily monitor and manage them [5]. This body brings new perception to the way in which 
we  interact  with  our  environment  on  multiple  levels  including  cultural,  business,  social, 
environmental,  etc.  [6].  The  sensor  entity  which  is  emerging  into  IoT  is  wireless  sensor

network. Wireless sensor networks are spatially distributed autonomous sensors that monitor 
physical  or  environmental  conditions.  Applications  of  WSNs  are  in  the  areas  such  as 
structural  health  monitoring,  health  monitoring,  environmental  observation,  habitat 
monitoring, and tracking among others [7]. These networks can be composed of thousands of 
small  smart  devices  with  computational  capability  and  memory,  one  or  more  sensors  and  a 
limited  power  supply.  The  continuous  progress  in  emerging  sensor  technologies  such  as 
WSNs has inspired IoT as this technology allows wide and cheap deployment of sensors on a 
large scale. 

The  integration  of  WSNs  to  the  Internet  needs  high  performance  computing  and  storage 
infrastructure  to  perform  real-time  data  processing  and  storage  of  data  from  WSNs  and 
analyzing  processed  information  to  extract  events  of  interest  [8].  For  this  reason,  cloud 
computing is proving to be a promising technology to provide flexible computing, storage and 
software services in a scalable and virtualized manner [9]. Sensor cloud infrastructure [10] is 
a secondary form of cloud computing that has been proposed by several IT people in present 
times. Sensor cloud allows managing of physical sensors on IT infrastructure. By utilizing the 
sensor cloud platform, several matters such as storing of collected data and processing them 
have  become  simple.  Many  real  life  applications  are  being  assimilated  to  the  sensor  cloud 
including  environmental  monitoring,  structural  monitoring,  disaster  monitoring,  agriculture, 
health care, telemetry, etc. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
2.1. Related Work  

In [11], the authors describe a design and development of a Flexible Tag Datalogger (FTD) 
to improve food and goods logistics during transportation, storage and vending. The device is 
composed  of  three  sensors  (temperature,  humidity  and  light)  and  a  microcontroller.  The 
sensor  data  is  transmitted  on  an  infrared  communication  (as  an  alternative  to  the  RFID 
technology)  to  enable  the  communication  with  most  common  personal  devices  such  as 
smartphones or PDA with integrated infrared port. The device was tested on bottled wine by 
developing custom packaging to house the device to allow it to be easily wrapped around the 
bottleneck.  The  flexible  tag  collects  data  of  its  environment  once  the  bottles  leave  the 
producer  cellar  for  shop.  When  bottles  arrive  at  the  shop,  the  FTD  attached  to  them 
downloads the data and is analyzed by PDA.   

Performance of ZigBee-Based wireless sensor nodes has been studied in [12] for real-time 
monitoring  of  fruit  logistics.  WSNs  are  a  promising  solution  to  the  monitoring  applications 
and  this  work  explores  the  potential  of  this  technology  for  monitoring  fruit  in  storage  and 
transportation conditions. It focuses on two different commercial modules of ZigBee, Xbow 
and  Xbee.  The  experiments  were  carried  out  in  experimental  refrigerated  chambers  and  the 
remainders  in  a  commercial  store.  The  main  parameters  considered  were  the  ratio  of 
measurement losses (%), battery life (minimum) and the influence of node location and on/off 
operation of the cooling system.   

Radio  frequency  identification  (RFID)  is  an  innovative  and  renowned  technology  that 
supports all types of traceability systems in many different areas and the work in [13] presents 
a  temperature  monitoring  solution  at  the  box  level  in  the  fish  supply  chain  as  part  of  the 
traceability system implemented using RFID technology. The temperature is measured in two 
ways; RFID data loggers are placed inside the box to measure temperature of the product and 
on  the  box to  measure the ambient temperature.  Sensor  data  is available  immediately  at the

The Xbee radios have the capability to gather and transmit sensor data without the aid of 
an external microcontroller. Using Xbee for direct input or output reduces the overall size of 
the  network,  reduces  power  consumption,  lowers  the  overall  cost  and  presents  less 
complicated approach. Series2 hardware allows its first four pins to be configured as analog 
input. First two pins of the Xbee were configured to read the analog values of the temperature 
and  humidity  sensors.    The  nodes  send  their  measured  sensor  values  to  the  base  station  at 
fixed intervals. 

The  base  station,  after  receiving  data  from  a  node,  prepares  the  data  so  that  it  can  be 
uploaded to the Xively cloud service. Xively sensor cloud is an open platform that provides 
service to its users free of charge. When creating a new device on the service (Refrigeration 
Chamber),  Feed  ID  and  API  key  is  auto-generated  to  be  used  in  Arduino  program  for 
uploading data to that feed. The feed contains a collection of datastreams for each node in the 
monitoring  environment  of  the  transport.  Developer  bench  of Xively  is  used for  visualizing 
the incoming sensor data as well as the metadata that is the device location. Figure 3 shows 
the  developer  workbench  of  Xively.  The  additional  datastream  is  used  for  monitoring  the 
supply voltage of the nodes to be aware of the battery status.

1. Introduction 

Cold Chain logistics refers to the transportation of pharmaceutical products, biologics and 
active  ingredients  in  controlled  temperature  environment.  These  temperature  sensitive  items 
require such environment to the very last stage of the cold chain so that they do not lose their 
potency and is fit for use or consumption. This applies to both high-risk and low-risk products 
such as insulins, vaccines and blood products [1]. The counterfeit products are a real threat to 
public health and safety [2]. 

In  the  early  1990’s,  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  and  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture  (USDA)  began  to  convey  the  Hazard  Analysis  Critical  Control  Point  (HACCP) 
rules as a systematic approach to food safety [3]. The same principle has now been applied to 
other  industries  dealing  with  temperature  sensitive  products  such  as  the  pharmaceutical 
industry.  The  HACCP  management  system  addresses  various  circumstances  for  product 
safety and among them is the handling and distribution of the finished product. HACCP has 
become universally recognized and accepted standard for product safety and has been adopted 
by  the  WHO  Standards  Programme  [4].  At  every  point  in  the  cold  chain,  precautions  are 
taken to ensure that the external conditions do not have any effect on the quality and stability 
of  the  products.  Records  of  essential  parameters  such  as  temperature  and  humidity  are 
maintained to provide evidence of compliance with recommended storage conditions. 

The IoT technology ties the physical world objects to the Internet and gives the flexibility

we  interact  with  our  environment  on  multiple  levels  including  cultural,  business,  social, 
environmental,  etc.  [6].  The  sensor  entity  which  is  emerging  into  IoT  is  wireless  sensor

network. Wireless sensor networks are spatially distributed autonomous sensors that monitor 
physical  or  environmental  conditions.  Applications  of  WSNs  are  in  the  areas  such  as 
structural  health  monitoring,  health  monitoring,  environmental  observation,  habitat 
monitoring, and tracking among others [7]. These networks can be composed of thousands of 
small  smart  devices  with  computational  capability  and  memory,  one  or  more  sensors  and  a 
limited  power  supply.  The  continuous  progress  in  emerging  sensor  technologies  such  as 
WSNs has inspired IoT as this technology allows wide and cheap deployment of sensors on a 
large scale. 

The  integration  of  WSNs  to  the  Internet  needs  high  performance  computing  and  storage 
infrastructure  to  perform  real-time  data  processing  and  storage  of  data  from  WSNs  and 
analyzing  processed  information  to  extract  events  of  interest  [8].  For  this  reason,  cloud 
computing is proving to be a promising technology to provide flexible computing, storage and 
software services in a scalable and virtualized manner [9]. Sensor cloud infrastructure [10] is 
a secondary form of cloud computing that has been proposed by several IT people in present 
times. Sensor cloud allows managing of physical sensors on IT infrastructure. By utilizing the 
sensor cloud platform, several matters such as storing of collected data and processing them 
have  become  simple.  Many  real  life  applications  are  being  assimilated  to  the  sensor  cloud 
including  environmental  monitoring,  structural  monitoring,  disaster  monitoring,  agriculture, 
health care, telemetry, etc. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
2.1. Related Work  

In [11], the authors describe a design and development of a Flexible Tag Datalogger (FTD) 
to improve food and goods logistics during transportation, storage and vending. The device is 
composed  of  three  sensors  (temperature,  humidity  and  light)  and  a  microcontroller.  The 
sensor  data  is  transmitted  on  an  infrared  communication  (as  an  alternative  to  the  RFID 
technology)  to  enable  the  communication  with  most  common  personal  devices  such  as 
smartphones or PDA with integrated infrared port. The device was tested on bottled wine by 
developing custom packaging to house the device to allow it to be easily wrapped around the 
bottleneck.  The  flexible  tag  collects  data  of  its  environment  once  the  bottles  leave  the 
producer  cellar  for  shop.  When  bottles  arrive  at  the  shop,  the  FTD  attached  to  them 
downloads the data and is analyzed by PDA.   

Performance of ZigBee-Based wireless sensor nodes has been studied in [12] for real-time 
monitoring  of  fruit  logistics.  WSNs  are  a  promising  solution  to  the  monitoring  applications 
and  this  work  explores  the  potential  of  this  technology  for  monitoring  fruit  in  storage  and 
transportation conditions. It focuses on two different commercial modules of ZigBee, Xbow 
and  Xbee.  The  experiments  were  carried  out  in  experimental  refrigerated  chambers  and  the 
remainders  in  a  commercial  store.  The  main  parameters  considered  were  the  ratio  of 
measurement losses (%), battery life (minimum) and the influence of node location and on/off 
operation of the cooling system.   

Radio  frequency  identification  (RFID)  is  an  innovative  and  renowned  technology  that 
supports all types of traceability systems in many different areas and the work in [13] presents 
a  temperature  monitoring  solution  at  the  box  level  in  the  fish  supply  chain  as  part  of  the 
traceability system implemented using RFID technology. The temperature is measured in two 
ways; RFID data loggers are placed inside the box to measure temperature of the product and 
on  the  box to  measure the ambient temperature.  Sensor  data  is available  immediately  at the 
delivery by mobile RFID reader and afterwards stored in the database to be presented on web 
to stakeholders and private consumers.

Work in [14] also looked at the performance of ZigBee motes through experiments under 
real  conditions. The  objective  of  the  experiment  was to test  wireless sensor  motes  based  on 
the  ZigBee/IEEE  802.15.4  protocol  during  shipment  of  refrigerated  vegetables.  The 
experiment  was  conducted  in  a  refrigerated  truck  travelling  through  Spain  and  France.  The 
paper  illustrated  great  potential  of  this  type  of  motes  that  could  provide  information  about 
several parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, opening of doors and truck stops. 
 
2.2. Technologies in this Work 
 
2.2.1. Internet of Things: In the beginning, the Internet was designed only for computers so 
that  they  could  access  websites,  download  contents  or  communicate  with  other  computers. 
The evolution of technology resulted in surfacing of powerful and faster devices with higher 
capabilities. With this evolution was the advancement of electronics technology that resulted 
in  development  of  smaller  devices  which  had  high  processing  capabilities  and  low  power 
consumption.  Due  to  these  devices,  large  networks  of  sensors  can  be  created,  having  the 
ability to obtain and process information and act accordingly. This idea of connecting objects 
or things to the Internet goes back a few decades. The early inventions of such devices were a 
toaster by John Romkey and Simon Hackett and a coffee pot by Quentin Stafford-Fraser and 
Paul Jardetzky in 1989 and 1992 respectively [15,16]. The term ‘Internet of Things’ was later 
coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999,  the director of MIT Auto-ID center, with the concept that 
computers  could  get  information  about  the  real  world  without  any  help  from  people  and 
giving information [17]. 
 
2.2.2. Arduino: Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform that is based on 
easy-to-use hardware and software. It is a board based platform with a single microcontroller 
input/output  pin  for  communication  and  control  of  physical  objects  and  a  development 
environment  for  writing  algorithms  for  the  board.  The  platform  grew  largely  out  of  “Do  It 
Yourself”  situation  created  by  the  proliferating  popularity  of  rapid  prototyping  boards  like 
PIC and Wiring, as well as the response to the growing needs of artists and designers to easily 
prototype  interactive  works  [18].  The  Arduino  devices  have  been  developed  to  connect  all 
sorts of objects and its functionality directly relates it to IoT. 
 
2.2.3. Web 2.0: Web 2.0 is the second generation World Wide Web that is focused on people 
to  have  the  ability  to  collaborate  and  share  information  online.  Formerly,  users  could  only 
view  or  download  data  contents  posted  on  websites  but  with  this  new  web,  the  users  have 
more  input into  the  nature and  scope  of  the  web contents and in  some  situations  exert real-
time control over it.  
 
2.2.4.  Mobile  Data  Network:  3G  mobile  data  network  is  the  result  of  a  decade  of 
development  and  evolution  of  GSM  standard  to  support  increased  data  needs.  It  allows 
network  operators  to  provide  its  users  a  bigger  range  of  services  due  to  bigger  network 
capacity  via  heightened  spectral  efficiency.  The  network  covers  a  wide  area  of  cellular 
telephone networks which incorporates high-speed Internet connection and video telephony. 
 
2.2.5.  Near  field  Communication:  Near  Field  Communication  (NFC)  is  a  wireless 
communication protocol which enables short-range communication between devices through 
high frequency to exchange data. Its root traces back to radio frequency identification (RFID). 
It is based on radio waves where data is exchanged between an identification card (NFC card) 
and a reader when brought together to a distance of about 4 centimeters.

2.2.6. ZigBee: ZigBee is a communication protocol that uses small, low-power digital radios. 
It is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for wireless personal area networks (WPANs) and 
is managed by the ZigBee Alliance. ZigBee is intended to be simpler and cheaper than other 
WPANs  such  as  Wi-Fi  and  Bluetooth.  This  technology  is  targeted  at  radio-frequency  (RF) 
applications which require low data rate, secure networking and longer battery life hence it is 
the  most  widely  used  standard  in  WSNs.  Sensor  data  are  typically  a  few  tens  of  bytes 
therefore  a  high  bandwidth  is  not  necessary  and  ZigBee’s low  bandwidth  helps  in  fulfilling 
the goal of low power, low cost and robustness [19].     
 
3. System Architecture 

The  architecture  of  the  proposed  system  for  monitoring  cold  chain  logistics  is  shown  in 
Figure  1.  The  system  can  be  used  in  transport  facilities  that  carry  products  from  the 
manufacturing site to distribution center or from one distribution center to another or from a 
distribution  center  to  the  customer/consumer.  The  workflow  of  the  monitoring  system  is  as 
follows. Each package must have unique NFC tag to identify the products being transported.  
The  hub/Base  Station  of the  system  reads  the products  as they  enter the  truck.  Inside the 
truck,  Nodes  are  installed  at  multiple  places  containing  temperature  and  humidity  sensors. 
Multiple nodes  allow  for  a  more  robust  monitoring  as  it  will  cater  for  different temperature 
points in the vicinity. These nodes also include wireless communication function that allows 
it to consistently send temperature and humidity values to the base station. The base station 
gathers data from the nodes and prepares them for upload to Sensor cloud together with GPS 
location of itself. The inventory data which is prepared from the NFC tags are emailed to the 
respective personnel. The location data is used to locate and trace the transport facility.

4. Implementation of the System 

In  this  section,  we  describe  the  implementation  details  of  the  proposed  cold  chain 
monitoring  system  for  logistics  [20].  We  will  focus  on  both  the  software  and  hardware 
development of the system as well as the configurations on the sensor cloud.  

The hardware platform used for the system is Arduino. The overall components of the base 
station  include  Arduino  microcontroller  (Mega  2560),  3G+GPS  shield  for  Arduino  from 
Cooking  Hacks,  NFC  shield  from  Adafruit,  series2  Xbee  shield  and  a  battery.  The  sensor

node consists of series2 Xbee radio, one temperature and humidity sensor and a battery. Table 
1  shows  the  specifications  of  the base station  and sensor  node.  Figure  2 shows  base  station 
and sensor node deployed in the transport facility.

The Xbee radios have the capability to gather and transmit sensor data without the aid of 
an external microcontroller. Using Xbee for direct input or output reduces the overall size of 
the  network,  reduces  power  consumption,  lowers  the  overall  cost  and  presents  less 
complicated approach. Series2 hardware allows its first four pins to be configured as analog 
input. First two pins of the Xbee were configured to read the analog values of the temperature 
and  humidity  sensors.    The  nodes  send  their  measured  sensor  values  to  the  base  station  at 
fixed intervals. 

The  base  station,  after  receiving  data  from  a  node,  prepares  the  data  so  that  it  can  be 
uploaded to the Xively cloud service. Xively sensor cloud is an open platform that provides 
service to its users free of charge. When creating a new device on the service (Refrigeration 
Chamber),  Feed  ID  and  API  key  is  auto-generated  to  be  used  in  Arduino  program  for 
uploading data to that feed. The feed contains a collection of datastreams for each node in the 
monitoring  environment  of  the  transport.  Developer  bench  of Xively  is  used for  visualizing 
the incoming sensor data as well as the metadata that is the device location. Figure 3 shows 
the  developer  workbench  of  Xively.  The  additional  datastream  is  used  for  monitoring  the 
supply voltage of the nodes to be aware of the battery status.

On  Xively,  the  senor  data are  graphed for  easy  visualization. The  triggers  are  one  of  the 
important  components  as  it  allows  setup  of  notification  when  certain  events  occur.  These 
notifications  are  linked  to  email  address(s)  of  appropriate  personnel  to  take  evasive  actions 
during times these events occur.  Zapier is an important application for this task as it allows 
automating tasks between web applications and they are Xively and email service. We define 
the  events  as shown  in Table  2.  For  this  experimentation, temperature  range  of 2-8  degrees 
Celsius  is  considered  as  the  safe  zone  for  products  and  a  humidity  value  below  50  percent. 
Email  notification  is  sent  when  any  of  the  condition  is  met.  Figure  4  depicts  the  email 
notification sent by Xively as well as email generated at base station regarding the inventory 
in the transport facility.

Abstract 

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new evolution in technological advancement taking place 
in  the  world  today.  This  paradigm  allows  physical  world  objects  in  our  surroundings  to  be 
connected  to  the  Internet.  This  idea  comes  to  life  by  utilizing  two  architecture;  the  Sensing 
Entity  in  the  environment  that  collects  data  and  connects  itself  to  the  cloud  and  the  Cloud 
Service  that  hosts  the  data  from  the  environment.  The  combination  of  wireless  sensor 
networks and cloud computing is becoming a popular strategy for the IoT era. The cold chain 
requires controlled environment for sensitive products in order for them to be fit for use. The 
monitoring process is the only assurance which tells if a certain process has been carried out 
successfully.  Taking  advantage  of  IoT  and  its  benefits  to  monitor  cold  chain  logistics  will 
result in better management and product handling. This paper looks at a system comprising 
of Arduino wireless sensor network and Xively sensor cloud which can be an ideal system to 
monitor temperature and humidity of cold chain logistics.

1. Introduction 

Cold Chain logistics refers to the transportation of pharmaceutical products, biologics and 
active  ingredients  in  controlled  temperature  environment.  These  temperature  sensitive  items 
require such environment to the very last stage of the cold chain so that they do not lose their 
potency and is fit for use or consumption. This applies to both high-risk and low-risk products 
such as insulins, vaccines and blood products [1]. The counterfeit products are a real threat to 
public health and safety [2]. 

In  the  early  1990’s,  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  and  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture  (USDA)  began  to  convey  the  Hazard  Analysis  Critical  Control  Point  (HACCP) 
rules as a systematic approach to food safety [3]. The same principle has now been applied to 
other  industries  dealing  with  temperature  sensitive  products  such  as  the  pharmaceutical 
industry.  The  HACCP  management  system  addresses  various  circumstances  for  product 
safety and among them is the handling and distribution of the finished product. HACCP has 
become universally recognized and accepted standard for product safety and has been adopted 
by  the  WHO  Standards  Programme  [4].  At  every  point  in  the  cold  chain,  precautions  are 
taken to ensure that the external conditions do not have any effect on the quality and stability 
of  the  products.  Records  of  essential  parameters  such  as  temperature  and  humidity  are 
maintained to provide evidence of compliance with recommended storage conditions. 

The IoT technology ties the physical world objects to the Internet and gives the flexibility 
to easily monitor and manage them [5]. This body brings new perception to the way in which 
we  interact  with  our  environment  on  multiple  levels  including  cultural,  business,  social, 
environmental,  etc.  [6].  The  sensor  entity  which  is  emerging  into  IoT  is  wireless  sensor

In  this  section,  we  describe  the  implementation  details  of  the  proposed  cold  chain 
monitoring  system  for  logistics  [20].  We  will  focus  on  both  the  software  and  hardware 
development of the system as well as the configurations on the sensor cloud.  

The hardware platform used for the system is Arduino. The overall components of the base 
station  include  Arduino  microcontroller  (Mega  2560),  3G+GPS  shield  for  Arduino  from

The Xbee radios have the capability to gather and transmit sensor data without the aid of 
an external microcontroller. Using Xbee for direct input or output reduces the overall size of 
the  network,  reduces  power  consumption,  lowers  the  overall  cost  and  presents  less 
complicated approach. Series2 hardware allows its first four pins to be configured as analog 
input. First two pins of the Xbee were configured to read the analog values of the temperature 
and  humidity  sensors.    The  nodes  send  their  measured  sensor  values  to  the  base  station  at 
fixed intervals. 

The  base  station,  after  receiving  data  from  a  node,  prepares  the  data  so  that  it  can  be 
uploaded to the Xively cloud service. Xively sensor cloud is an open platform that provides 
service to its users free of charge. When creating a new device on the service (Refrigeration 
Chamber),  Feed  ID  and  API  key  is  auto-generated  to  be  used  in  Arduino  program  for 
uploading data to that feed. The feed contains a collection of datastreams for each node in the 
monitoring  environment  of  the  transport.  Developer  bench  of Xively  is  used for  visualizing 
the incoming sensor data as well as the metadata that is the device location. Figure 3 shows 
the  developer  workbench  of  Xively.  The  additional  datastream  is  used  for  monitoring  the 
supply voltage of the nodes to be aware of the battery status.

The  expansion  of  embedded  ICT  infrastructure  has  caused  the  deployment  of  wide 
range  of  embedded  systems  in  our  environment  which  points  out  the  need  for 
manageable and flexible wireless sensor network. IoT is a solution which proves to be  a

Abstract 

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new evolution in technological advancement taking place 
in  the  world  today.  This  paradigm  allows  physical  world  objects  in  our  surroundings  to  be 
connected  to  the  Internet.  This  idea  comes  to  life  by  utilizing  two  architecture;  the  Sensing 
Entity  in  the  environment  that  collects  data  and  connects  itself  to  the  cloud  and  the  Cloud 
Service  that  hosts  the  data  from  the  environment.  The  combination  of  wireless  sensor 
networks and cloud computing is becoming a popular strategy for the IoT era. The cold chain 
requires controlled environment for sensitive products in order for them to be fit for use. The 
monitoring process is the only assurance which tells if a certain process has been carried out 
successfully.  Taking  advantage  of  IoT  and  its  benefits  to  monitor  cold  chain  logistics  will 
result in better management and product handling. This paper looks at a system comprising 
of Arduino wireless sensor network and Xively sensor cloud which can be an ideal system to 
monitor temperature and humidity of cold chain logistics.

1. Introduction 

Cold Chain logistics refers to the transportation of pharmaceutical products, biologics and 
active  ingredients  in  controlled  temperature  environment.  These  temperature  sensitive  items 
require such environment to the very last stage of the cold chain so that they do not lose their 
potency and is fit for use or consumption. This applies to both high-risk and low-risk products 
such as insulins, vaccines and blood products [1]. The counterfeit products are a real threat to 
public health and safety [2]. 

In  the  early  1990’s,  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  and  U.S.  Department  of 
Agriculture  (USDA)  began  to  convey  the  Hazard  Analysis  Critical  Control  Point  (HACCP) 
rules as a systematic approach to food safety [3]. The same principle has now been applied to 
other  industries  dealing  with  temperature  sensitive  products  such  as  the  pharmaceutical 
industry.  The  HACCP  management  system  addresses  various  circumstances  for  product 
safety and among them is the handling and distribution of the finished product. HACCP has 
become universally recognized and accepted standard for product safety and has been adopted 
by  the  WHO  Standards  Programme  [4].  At  every  point  in  the  cold  chain,  precautions  are 
taken to ensure that the external conditions do not have any effect on the quality and stability 
of  the  products.  Records  of  essential  parameters  such  as  temperature  and  humidity  are 
maintained to provide evidence of compliance with recommended storage conditions. 

The IoT technology ties the physical world objects to the Internet and gives the flexibility 
to easily monitor and manage them [5]. This body brings new perception to the way in which 
we  interact  with  our  environment  on  multiple  levels  including  cultural,  business,  social, 
environmental,  etc.  [6].  The  sensor  entity  which  is  emerging  into  IoT  is  wireless  sensor

network. Wireless sensor networks are spatially distributed autonomous sensors that monitor 
physical  or  environmental  conditions.  Applications  of  WSNs  are  in  the  areas  such  as 
structural  health  monitoring,  health  monitoring,  environmental  observation,  habitat 
monitoring, and tracking among others [7]. These networks can be composed of thousands of 
small  smart  devices  with  computational  capability  and  memory,  one  or  more  sensors  and  a 
limited  power  supply.  The  continuous  progress  in  emerging  sensor  technologies  such  as 
WSNs has inspired IoT as this technology allows wide and cheap deployment of sensors on a 
large scale. 

The  integration  of  WSNs  to  the  Internet  needs  high  performance  computing  and  storage 
infrastructure  to  perform  real-time  data  processing  and  storage  of  data  from  WSNs  and 
analyzing  processed  information  to  extract  events  of  interest  [8].  For  this  reason,  cloud 
computing is proving to be a promising technology to provide flexible computing, storage and 
software services in a scalable and virtualized manner [9]. Sensor cloud infrastructure [10] is 
a secondary form of cloud computing that has been proposed by several IT people in present 
times. Sensor cloud allows managing of physical sensors on IT infrastructure. By utilizing the 
sensor cloud platform, several matters such as storing of collected data and processing them 
have  become  simple.  Many  real  life  applications  are  being  assimilated  to  the  sensor  cloud 
including  environmental  monitoring,  structural  monitoring,  disaster  monitoring,  agriculture, 
health care, telemetry, etc. 
 
2. Literature Review 
 
2.1. Related Work  

In [11], the authors describe a design and development of a Flexible Tag Datalogger (FTD) 
to improve food and goods logistics during transportation, storage and vending. The device is 
composed  of  three  sensors  (temperature,  humidity  and  light)  and  a  microcontroller.  The 
sensor  data  is  transmitted  on  an  infrared  communication  (as  an  alternative  to  the  RFID 
technology)  to  enable  the  communication  with  most  common  personal  devices  such  as 
smartphones or PDA with integrated infrared port. The device was tested on bottled wine by 
developing custom packaging to house the device to allow it to be easily wrapped around the 
bottleneck.  The  flexible  tag  collects  data  of  its  environment  once  the  bottles  leave  the 
producer  cellar  for  shop.  When  bottles  arrive  at  the  shop,  the  FTD  attached  to  them 
downloads the data and is analyzed by PDA.   

Performance of ZigBee-Based wireless sensor nodes has been studied in [12] for real-time 
monitoring  of  fruit  logistics.  WSNs  are  a  promising  solution  to  the  monitoring  applications 
and  this  work  explores  the  potential  of  this  technology  for  monitoring  fruit  in  storage  and 
transportation conditions. It focuses on two different commercial modules of ZigBee, Xbow 
and  Xbee.  The  experiments  were  carried  out  in  experimental  refrigerated  chambers  and  the 
remainders  in  a  commercial  store.  The  main  parameters  considered  were  the  ratio  of 
measurement losses (%), battery life (minimum) and the influence of node location and on/off 
operation of the cooling system.   

Radio  frequency  identification  (RFID)  is  an  innovative  and  renowned  technology  that 
supports all types of traceability systems in many different areas and the work in [13] presents 
a  temperature  monitoring  solution  at  the  box  level  in  the  fish  supply  chain  as  part  of  the 
traceability system implemented using RFID technology. The temperature is measured in two 
ways; RFID data loggers are placed inside the box to measure temperature of the product and 
on  the  box to  measure the ambient temperature.  Sensor  data  is available  immediately  at the 
delivery by mobile RFID reader and afterwards stored in the database to be presented on web 
to stakeholders and private consumers.

Work in [14] also looked at the performance of ZigBee motes through experiments under 
real  conditions. The  objective  of  the  experiment  was to test  wireless sensor  motes  based  on 
the  ZigBee/IEEE  802.15.4  protocol  during  shipment  of  refrigerated  vegetables.  The 
experiment  was  conducted  in  a  refrigerated  truck  travelling  through  Spain  and  France.  The 
paper  illustrated  great  potential  of  this  type  of  motes  that  could  provide  information  about 
several parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, opening of doors and truck stops. 
 
2.2. Technologies in this Work 
 
2.2.1. Internet of Things: In the beginning, the Internet was designed only for computers so 
that  they  could  access  websites,  download  contents  or  communicate  with  other  computers. 
The evolution of technology resulted in surfacing of powerful and faster devices with higher 
capabilities. With this evolution was the advancement of electronics technology that resulted 
in  development  of  smaller  devices  which  had  high  processing  capabilities  and  low  power 
consumption.  Due  to  these  devices,  large  networks  of  sensors  can  be  created,  having  the 
ability to obtain and process information and act accordingly. This idea of connecting objects 
or things to the Internet goes back a few decades. The early inventions of such devices were a 
toaster by John Romkey and Simon Hackett and a coffee pot by Quentin Stafford-Fraser and 
Paul Jardetzky in 1989 and 1992 respectively [15,16]. The term ‘Internet of Things’ was later 
coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999,  the director of MIT Auto-ID center, with the concept that 
computers  could  get  information  about  the  real  world  without  any  help  from  people  and 
giving information [17]. 
 
2.2.2. Arduino: Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform that is based on 
easy-to-use hardware and software. It is a board based platform with a single microcontroller 
input/output  pin  for  communication  and  control  of  physical  objects  and  a  development 
environment  for  writing  algorithms  for  the  board.  The  platform  grew  largely  out  of  “Do  It 
Yourself”  situation  created  by  the  proliferating  popularity  of  rapid  prototyping  boards  like 
PIC and Wiring, as well as the response to the growing needs of artists and designers to easily 
prototype  interactive  works  [18].  The  Arduino  devices  have  been  developed  to  connect  all 
sorts of objects and its functionality directly relates it to IoT. 
 
2.2.3. Web 2.0: Web 2.0 is the second generation World Wide Web that is focused on people 
to  have  the  ability  to  collaborate  and  share  information  online.  Formerly,  users  could  only 
view  or  download  data  contents  posted  on  websites  but  with  this  new  web,  the  users  have 
more  input into  the  nature and  scope  of  the  web contents and in  some  situations  exert real-
time control over it.  
 
2.2.4.  Mobile  Data  Network:  3G  mobile  data  network  is  the  result  of  a  decade  of 
development  and  evolution  of  GSM  standard  to  support  increased  data  needs.  It  allows 
network  operators  to  provide  its  users  a  bigger  range  of  services  due  to  bigger  network 
capacity  via  heightened  spectral  efficiency.  The  network  covers  a  wide  area  of  cellular 
telephone networks which incorporates high-speed Internet connection and video telephony. 
 
2.2.5.  Near  field  Communication:  Near  Field  Communication  (NFC)  is  a  wireless 
communication protocol which enables short-range communication between devices through 
high frequency to exchange data. Its root traces back to radio frequency identification (RFID). 
It is based on radio waves where data is exchanged between an identification card (NFC card) 
and a reader when brought together to a distance of about 4 centimeters.

2.2.6. ZigBee: ZigBee is a communication protocol that uses small, low-power digital radios. 
It is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for wireless personal area networks (WPANs) and 
is managed by the ZigBee Alliance. ZigBee is intended to be simpler and cheaper than other 
WPANs  such  as  Wi-Fi  and  Bluetooth.  This  technology  is  targeted  at  radio-frequency  (RF) 
applications which require low data rate, secure networking and longer battery life hence it is 
the  most  widely  used  standard  in  WSNs.  Sensor  data  are  typically  a  few  tens  of  bytes 
therefore  a  high  bandwidth  is  not  necessary  and  ZigBee’s low  bandwidth  helps  in  fulfilling 
the goal of low power, low cost and robustness [19].     
 
3. System Architecture 

The  architecture  of  the  proposed  system  for  monitoring  cold  chain  logistics  is  shown  in 
Figure  1.  The  system  can  be  used  in  transport  facilities  that  carry  products  from  the 
manufacturing site to distribution center or from one distribution center to another or from a 
distribution  center  to  the  customer/consumer.  The  workflow  of  the  monitoring  system  is  as 
follows. Each package must have unique NFC tag to identify the products being transported.  
The  hub/Base  Station  of the  system  reads  the products  as they  enter the  truck.  Inside the 
truck,  Nodes  are  installed  at  multiple  places  containing  temperature  and  humidity  sensors. 
Multiple nodes  allow  for  a  more  robust  monitoring  as  it  will  cater  for  different temperature 
points in the vicinity. These nodes also include wireless communication function that allows 
it to consistently send temperature and humidity values to the base station. The base station 
gathers data from the nodes and prepares them for upload to Sensor cloud together with GPS 
location of itself. The inventory data which is prepared from the NFC tags are emailed to the 
respective personnel. The location data is used to locate and trace the transport facility.
