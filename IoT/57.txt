to 

immediate  and  continuous  access 

surrounding  smart  spaces  for  improved  comfort,  health, 
efficiency,  and  safety.  In  fact,  smart  watches,  phones,  body 
nodes,  and  clothes  will  act  as  personalized  input  to  optimize 
city-wide  services  benefiting  both  the  individual  and  society. 
Consequently,  we  will  often  (perhaps  24/7)  be  implicitly 
linked  into  the  new  utility.  Some  examples  of  new  services 
include 
the  right 
information  for  the  task  at  hand,  be  it,  traveling  to  work  or  a 
meeting, exercising, shopping, socializing, or visiting a doctor. 
Sometimes  these  activities  will  be  virtual  activities,  or  even 
include  the  use  of  avatars  or  robots.  Many  outputs  and 
displays  for  users  may  be  holographic.  Credit  cards  should 
disappear and biometrics like voice or retinas will provide safe 
access to buildings, ATMs, and transportation systems.  
 
A  sensing  and  actuation  utility  will  not  only  exist  in  public 
spaces,  but  also  extend  into  the  home,  apartments,  and 
condominiums.    Here  people  will  be  able  to  run  health, 
energy, security, and entertainment apps on the infrastructure. 
Installing and running new apps will be as easy as plugging in 
a  new  toaster  into  the  electric  utility.  One  app  may  help 
monitor  and  control  heart  rate,  another  perform  financial  and 
investments services, another automatically ordering food and 
wine,  or  even  predicting  a  impending  medical  problem  that 
should  be  addressed  early  to  mitigate  or  even  avoid  the 
problem.  Humans  will  often  be  integral  parts  of  the  IoT 
system. The Industrial Internet is also a form of IoT where the 
devices  (things)  are  objects  in  manufacturing  plants,  dispatch 
centers,  process  control  industries,  etc.  Consequently,  in  the 
future  the  scope  of  IoT  is  enormous  and  will  affect  every 
aspect of all our lives. 

III.  RESEARCH 

The  spectrum  of  research  required  to  achieve  IoT  at  the 
scale  envisioned  above  requires  significant  research  along 
many  directions.  In  this  section  problems  and  required 
research  are  highlighted  in  8  topic  areas:  massive  scaling, 
architecture  and  dependencies,  creating  knowledge  and  big 
data,  robustness,  openness,  security,  privacy,  and  human-in-
the-loop.  Each  of  the  topic  discussions  primarily  focuses  on 
new  problems  that  arise  for  future  IoT  systems  of  the  type 
described in Section II. The research topics presented in each 
case are representative and not complete. 

Many

standards, the impact of privacy laws, and  the cultural impact 
on use of these technologies are outside the scope of the paper. 

topics  such  as 

A.  Massive Scaling 

 
The  current  trajectory  of  the  numbers  of  smart  devices  being 
deployed implies that eventually trillions of things  will be on 
the  Internet.  How  to  name,  authenticate  access,  maintain, 
protect, use, and support such a large scale of things are major 
problems. Will IPv6 suffice? Will protocols such a 6LowPAN 
play  a  role?  Will  entirely  new  standards  and  protocols 
emerge? Since many of the things on the Internet will require 
their  own  energy  source,  will  energy  scavenging  and 
enormously 
the  need  for 
batteries? How will the massive amounts of data be collected, 

low  power  circuits  eliminate 

used,  and  stored?  What 
longitudinal  studies  will  be 
performed?  How  will  the  real-time  and  reliability  aspects  be 
supported [5][13]? How will devices including mobile devices 
be  discovered?  Will  the  emergence  of  a  utility  model,  if  it 
occurs,  mean entirely new  standards? How  will  such a utility 
be  achieved?  It  is  unlikely  that  any  solution  immediately 
becomes  the  norm.    Many  protocols  and  variations  will  co-
exist. What will be the architectural model that can support the 
expected heterogeneity of devices and applications?  
 

B.  Architecture and Dependencies 

and 

control, 

communications, 

to  borrow  from 

 
As trillions of things (objects) are connected to the Internet it 
is necessary to have an adequate architecture that permits easy 
connectivity, 
useful 
applications.  How  will  these  objects  interact  in  and  across 
applications [37]? Many times, things or sets of things must be 
disjoint  and  protected  from  other  devices.    At  other  times  it 
makes  sense  to  share  devices  and  information.  One  possible 
architectural  approach  for  IoT  is 
the 
smartphone  world  [2][4].  Smartphones  employ  an  approach 
where applications are implemented and  made available from 
an  app  store.  This  has  many  advantages  including  an 
unbounded development of novel applications that can execute 
on  the  smartphones.  Various  standards  and  automatic  checks 
are  made  to  ensure  that  an  app  can  execute  on  a  given 
platform.  For  example,  the  correct  version  of  the  underlying 
OS  and  the  required  sensors  and  actuators  can  be  checked 
when  the  app  is  installed  [12].  A  similar  architectural 
approach  for  IoT  would  also  have  similar  advantages. 
However,  the  underlying  platform  for  IoT  is  much  more 
complicated  than  for  smartphones.  Nevertheless,  if  IoT  is 
based  on  an  underlying  sensor  and  actuator  network  that  acts 
as a utility similar to electricity and water, then, different IoT 
applications  can  be  installed  on  this  utility.  While  each 
application  must  solve  its  own  problems,  the  sharing  of  a 
sensing  and  actuation  utility  across  multiple  simultaneously 
running  applications  can  result  in  many  systems-of-systems 
interference  problems,  especially  with 
the  actuators. 
Interferences  arise  from  many  issues,  but  primarily  when  the 
cyber  depends  on  assumptions  about  the  environment,  the 
hardware platform, requirements, naming, control and various 
device  semantics.  Previous  work,  in  general,  has  considered 
relatively simple dependencies related to numbers and types of 
parameters,  versions  of  underlying  operating  systems,  and 
availability  of  correct  underlying  hardware.  Research  is 
needed  to  develop  a  comprehensive  approach  to  specifying, 
detecting,  and  resolving  dependencies  across  applications. 
This  is  especially  important  for  safety  critical  applications  or 
when actuators can cause harm. 
 
Let’s  consider  a  few  examples  of  dependencies  [21][31][32]. 
Assume  that  we  integrate  several  systems  responsible  for 
energy  management  (controlling  thermostats  [17],  windows, 
doors,  and  shades)  and  home  health  care  (controlling  lights, 
TVs,  body  nodes  measuring  heart  rate  and  temperature,  and 
sleep apnea machines [33]). If information can be shared, this 
would  allow  the  energy  management  system  to  adjust  room 
temperature  depending  on  the  physiological  status  of  the

immediate  and  continuous  access 

surrounding  smart  spaces  for  improved  comfort,  health, 
efficiency,  and  safety.  In  fact,  smart  watches,  phones,  body 
nodes,  and  clothes  will  act  as  personalized  input  to  optimize 
city-wide  services  benefiting  both  the  individual  and  society. 
Consequently,  we  will  often  (perhaps  24/7)  be  implicitly 
linked  into  the  new  utility.  Some  examples  of  new  services 
include 
the  right 
information  for  the  task  at  hand,  be  it,  traveling  to  work  or  a 
meeting, exercising, shopping, socializing, or visiting a doctor. 
Sometimes  these  activities  will  be  virtual  activities,  or  even 
include  the  use  of  avatars  or  robots.  Many  outputs  and 
displays  for  users  may  be  holographic.  Credit  cards  should 
disappear and biometrics like voice or retinas will provide safe 
access to buildings, ATMs, and transportation systems.  
 
A  sensing  and  actuation  utility  will  not  only  exist  in  public 
spaces,  but  also  extend  into  the  home,  apartments,  and 
condominiums.    Here  people  will  be  able  to  run  health, 
energy, security, and entertainment apps on the infrastructure. 
Installing and running new apps will be as easy as plugging in 
a  new  toaster  into  the  electric  utility.  One  app  may  help 
monitor  and  control  heart  rate,  another  perform  financial  and 
investments services, another automatically ordering food and 
wine,  or  even  predicting  a  impending  medical  problem  that 
should  be  addressed  early  to  mitigate  or  even  avoid  the 
problem.  Humans  will  often  be  integral  parts  of  the  IoT 
system. The Industrial Internet is also a form of IoT where the 
devices  (things)  are  objects  in  manufacturing  plants,  dispatch 
centers,  process  control  industries,  etc.  Consequently,  in  the 
future  the  scope  of  IoT  is  enormous  and  will  affect  every 
aspect of all our lives. 

III.  RESEARCH 

The  spectrum  of  research  required  to  achieve  IoT  at  the 
scale  envisioned  above  requires  significant  research  along 
many  directions.  In  this  section  problems  and  required 
research  are  highlighted  in  8  topic  areas:  massive  scaling, 
architecture  and  dependencies,  creating  knowledge  and  big 
data,  robustness,  openness,  security,  privacy,  and  human-in-
the-loop.  Each  of  the  topic  discussions  primarily  focuses  on 
new  problems  that  arise  for  future  IoT  systems  of  the  type 
described in Section II. The research topics presented in each 
case are representative and not complete.

topics  such  as 

A.  Massive Scaling 

 
The  current  trajectory  of  the  numbers  of  smart  devices  being 
deployed implies that eventually trillions of things  will be on 
the  Internet.  How  to  name,  authenticate  access,  maintain, 
protect, use, and support such a large scale of things are major 
problems. Will IPv6 suffice? Will protocols such a 6LowPAN 
play  a  role?  Will  entirely  new  standards  and  protocols 
emerge? Since many of the things on the Internet will require 
their  own  energy  source,  will  energy  scavenging  and 
enormously 
the  need  for 
batteries? How will the massive amounts of data be collected, 

low  power  circuits  eliminate 

used,  and  stored?  What 
longitudinal  studies  will  be 
performed?  How  will  the  real-time  and  reliability  aspects  be 
supported [5][13]? How will devices including mobile devices 
be  discovered?  Will  the  emergence  of  a  utility  model,  if  it 
occurs,  mean entirely new  standards? How  will  such a utility 
be  achieved?  It  is  unlikely  that  any  solution  immediately 
becomes  the  norm.    Many  protocols  and  variations  will  co-
exist. What will be the architectural model that can support the 
expected heterogeneity of devices and applications?  
 

B.  Architecture and Dependencies 

and 

control, 

communications, 

to  borrow  from 

 
As trillions of things (objects) are connected to the Internet it 
is necessary to have an adequate architecture that permits easy 
connectivity, 
useful 
applications.  How  will  these  objects  interact  in  and  across 
applications [37]? Many times, things or sets of things must be 
disjoint  and  protected  from  other  devices.    At  other  times  it 
makes  sense  to  share  devices  and  information.  One  possible 
architectural  approach  for  IoT  is 
the 
smartphone  world  [2][4].  Smartphones  employ  an  approach 
where applications are implemented and  made available from 
an  app  store.  This  has  many  advantages  including  an 
unbounded development of novel applications that can execute 
on  the  smartphones.  Various  standards  and  automatic  checks 
are  made  to  ensure  that  an  app  can  execute  on  a  given 
platform.  For  example,  the  correct  version  of  the  underlying 
OS  and  the  required  sensors  and  actuators  can  be  checked 
when  the  app  is  installed  [12].  A  similar  architectural 
approach  for  IoT  would  also  have  similar  advantages. 
However,  the  underlying  platform  for  IoT  is  much  more 
complicated  than  for  smartphones.  Nevertheless,  if  IoT  is 
based  on  an  underlying  sensor  and  actuator  network  that  acts 
as a utility similar to electricity and water, then, different IoT 
applications  can  be  installed  on  this  utility.  While  each 
application  must  solve  its  own  problems,  the  sharing  of  a 
sensing  and  actuation  utility  across  multiple  simultaneously 
running  applications  can  result  in  many  systems-of-systems 
interference  problems,  especially  with 
the  actuators. 
Interferences  arise  from  many  issues,  but  primarily  when  the 
cyber  depends  on  assumptions  about  the  environment,  the 
hardware platform, requirements, naming, control and various 
device  semantics.  Previous  work,  in  general,  has  considered 
relatively simple dependencies related to numbers and types of 
parameters,  versions  of  underlying  operating  systems,  and 
availability  of  correct  underlying  hardware.  Research  is 
needed  to  develop  a  comprehensive  approach  to  specifying, 
detecting,  and  resolving  dependencies  across  applications. 
This  is  especially  important  for  safety  critical  applications  or 
when actuators can cause harm. 
 
Let’s  consider  a  few  examples  of  dependencies  [21][31][32]. 
Assume  that  we  integrate  several  systems  responsible  for 
energy  management  (controlling  thermostats  [17],  windows, 
doors,  and  shades)  and  home  health  care  (controlling  lights, 
TVs,  body  nodes  measuring  heart  rate  and  temperature,  and 
sleep apnea machines [33]). If information can be shared, this 
would  allow  the  energy  management  system  to  adjust  room 
temperature  depending  on  the  physiological  status  of  the

rooms,  and 

residents  as  detected  by  the  home  health  care  system.  Also, 
integration  will  allow  avoiding  negative  consequences.  For 
example,  the  integrated  system  will  not  turn  off  medical 
appliances  to  save  energy  while  they  are  being  used  as 
suggested by the home health care system. In addition to these 
advantages,  all  the  systems  can  share  sensors  and  actuators, 
which  will  reduce  cost  of  deployment,  improve  aesthetics  of 
the 
reduce  channel  contention.  However, 
integrating  multiple  systems  is  very  challenging  as  each 
individual  system  has  its  own  assumptions  and  strategy  to 
control the physical world variables without much knowledge 
of  the  other  systems,  which  leads  to  conflicts  when  these 
systems  are  integrated  without  careful  consideration.  For 
example,  a  home  health  care  application  may  detect 
depression  and  decide  to  turn  on  all  the  lights.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  energy  management  application  may  decide  to  turn 
off lights when no motion is detected. Detecting and resolving 
such  dependency  problems  is  important  for  correctness  of 
operation of interacting IoT systems. 
 

C.  Creating Knowledge and Big Data 

 
In  an  IoT  world  there  will  exist  a  vast  amount  of  raw  data 
being  continuously  collected.  It  will  be  necessary  to  develop 
techniques  that  convert  this  raw  data  into  usable  knowledge. 
For example, in the medical area, raw streams of sensor values 
must  be  converted  into  semantically  meaningful  activities 
performed  by  or  about  a  person  such  as  eating,  poor 
respiration, or exhibiting signs of depression. Main challenges 
for data interpretation and the formation of knowledge include 
addressing  noisy,  physical  world  data  and  developing  new 
inference  techniques  that  do  not  suffer  the  limitations  of 
Bayesian  or  Dempster-Shafer  schemes.  These  limitations 
include the need to know a priori probabilities and the cost of 
computations. Rule based systems may be used, but may also 
be too ad hoc for some applications.  
 
The  amount  of  collected  data  will  be  enormous.  It  can  be 
expected  that  a  very  large  number  of  real-time  sensor  data 
streams will exist, that it will be common for a given stream of 
data  to  be  used  in  many  different  ways  for  many  different 
inference  purposes,  that  the  data  provenance  and  how  it  was 
processed must be known, and that privacy and security must 
be  applied.  Data  mining  techniques  are  expected  to  provide 
the  creation  of  important  knowledge  from  all  this  data. 
Enabling  streams  to  act  as  primitives  for  unexpected  future 
inferences  is  an  interesting  research  problem.  In  addition,  the 
overall  system  solution  must  deal  with  the  fact  that  no 
inference  method  is  100%  correct.  Consequently,  uncertainty 
in  interpreted  data  can  easily  cause  users  not  to  trust  the 
system.   
 
Trust  is  one  important  aspect  of  the  usefulness  of  big  data.  
Security  and  privacy  are  essential  elements  of  trust  and  these 
are  discussed  in  their  own  sections.  However,  as  a  basis  for 
trust  it  is  also  necessary  to  develop  new  in-field  sensor 
calibration 
transport  protocols. 
Without  these  basic  underlying  system-level  capabilities 
further inference  might be operating  with  wrong or too  much 

techniques  and

If our vision is correct, many IoT applications will be based on 
a  deployed  sensing,  actuation,  and  communication  platform 
(connecting  a  network  of  things).  In  these  deployments  it  is 
common  for  the  devices  to  know  their  locations,  have 
synchronized  clocks,  know  their  neighbor  devices  when 
cooperating,  and  have  a  coherent  set  of  parameter  settings 
such as consistent sleep/wake-up schedules, appropriate power 
levels  for  communication,  and  pair-wise  security  keys. 
However, over time these conditions can deteriorate. The most 
common (and simple) example of this deterioration problem is 
with clock synchronization [18]. Over time, clock drift causes 
nodes  to  have  different  enough  times  to  result  in  application 
failures.  While 
that  clock 
synchronization  must  re-occur,  this  principle  is  much  more 
general.  For  example,  some  nodes  may  be  physically  moved 
unexpectedly. More and more nodes may become out of place 
over  time.  To  make  system-wide  node  locations  coherent 
again,  node  re-localization  needs  to  occur  (albeit  at  a  much 
slower rate than for clock sync). This issue can be considered 
a  form  of  entropy  where  a  system  will  deteriorate  (tend 
towards  disorder)  unless  energy  in  the  form  of  re-running 
protocols  and  other  self-healing  mechanisms  is  applied  [35]. 
Note that control of actuators can also deteriorate due to their 
controlling  software  and  protocols,  but  also  due  to  physical 
wear and tear. In other words, how can a long-lived, dynamic, 
and mobile IoT be maintained? 
 
The required coherence (entropy) services must combine with 
many  other  approaches  to  produce  robust  system  operation. 
This includes formal methods to develop reliable code, in-situ 
debugging 
in-field-

techniques,  on-line

missing  data,  resulting  in  wrong  conclusions.  If  these  wrong 
conclusions  drive  actuators  then  serious  safety  problems  can 
occur. One approach is to ensure that all inferred information 
is  accompanied  by  a  confidence  level  in  the  form  of  a 
probability that the information is correct or incorrect and use 
that information to guarantee safe actuator operation. In many 
applications,  informing  users  how  information  was  derived  is 
necessary.  Another  main  challenge  is  making  good  (control) 
decisions  using  the  created  knowledge.  However,  in  making 
decisions  it  is  necessary  to  minimize  the  number  of  false 
negatives  and  false  positives  and  guarantee  safety,  otherwise 
the system will be dismissed as unreliable.  
Many  IoT  applications  will  be  designed  to  work  for  a 
particular  person.  It  is  necessary  to  perform  correct  data 
association  ensuring  that  the  collected  data  and  subsequent 
inferences  are  associated  with  the  correct  individual  or 
individuals.  This  is  a  very  challenging  problem  for  many 
situations.  When  users  are  wearing  RFIDs  or  when  cameras 
with  pattern  recognition  are  used  then  the  problem  is  solved 
(except  for  the  privacy  issues).  However,  in  many  other 
situations  it  will  be  necessary  to  combine  a  set  of  current 
sensor  readings  with  a  trace  of  the  recent  past  readings  and 
utilize  a  history  of  a  given  user’s  activities  and  personal 
characteristics  to  arrive  at  an  accurate  data  assignment.  More 
research is necessary on this problem.

Abstract—Many 

communities  are  vigorously 
pursuing research topics that contribute to the Internet of Things 
(IoT).  Today,  as  sensing,  actuation,  communication,  and  control 
become  ever  more  sophisticated  and  ubiquitous,  there 
is 
significant overlap in these communities, sometimes from slightly 
different perspectives.  More cooperation between communities is 
encouraged.  To  provide  a  basis  for  discussing  open  research 
problems in IoT, a vision for how IoT could change the world in 
the  distant  future  is  first  presented.  Then,  eight  key  research 
topics are enumerated and research problems within those topics 
are discussed.

such  prominent 

mart  devices.  Smartphones.  Smart  cars.  Smart  homes. 
Smart  cities.  A  smart  world.  These  notions  have  been 
espoused for  many  years.  Achieving these  goals has been 
investigated,  to  date,  by  many  diverse  and  often  disjoint 
research  communities.  Five 
research 
communities are: Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile Computing 
(MC),  Pervasive  Computing  (PC),  Wireless  Sensor  Networks 
(WSN),  and  most  recently,  Cyber  Physical  Systems  (CPS). 
However,  as  technology  and  solutions  progress  in  each  of 
these  fields  there  is  an  increasing  overlap  and  merger  of 
principles  and  research  questions.  Narrow  definitions  of  each 
of  these  fields  are  no  longer  appropriate.  Further,  research  in 
IoT,  PC,  MC,  WSN  and  CPS  often  relies  on  underlying 
technologies  such  as  real-time  computing,  machine  learning, 
security,  privacy,  signal  processing,  big  data,  and  others. 
Consequently, the smart vision of the world involves much of 
computer  science,  computer  engineering,  and  electrical 
engineering.  Greater  interactions  among  these  communities 
will speed progress. 
 
In this paper, as a backdrop to identifying research questions, I 
briefly highlight a vision for a smart world (Section II). I then 
discuss  open  research  questions  categorized  into  8  topics

number  of  significant  research  needs  for  future  IoT  systems, 
and  (ii)  to  raise  awareness  of  work  being  performed  across 
various research communities. 

II.  VISION AND IOT SCOPE 

Many  people  [8],  including  myself    [28][29],  hold  the  view 
that  cities  and  the  world  itself  will  be  overlaid  with  sensing 
and  actuation,  many  embedded  in  “things”  creating  what  is 
referred  to  as  a  smart  world.  But  it  is  important  to  note  that 
one  key  issue  is  the  degree  of  the  density  of  sensing  and 
actuation  coverage.  I  believe  that  there  will  be  a  transition 
point  when  the degree of coverage triples or quadruples from 
what  we  have  today.  At  that  time  there  will  be  a  qualitative 
change.  For  example,  today  many  buildings  already  have 
sensors  for  attempting 
to  save  energy  [7][38];  home 
automation is occurring [3]; cars, taxis, and traffic lights have 
devices  to  try  and  improve  safety  and  transportation  [9]; 
people  have  smartphones  with  sensors  for  running  many 
useful apps [2]; industrial plants are connecting to the Internet 
[1];  and  healthcare  services  are  relying  on  increased  home 
sensing  to  support  remote  medicine  and  wellness  [11]. 
However, all of these are just the tip of the iceberg. They are 
all still at early stages of development. The  steady increasing 
density  of  sensing  and  the  sophistication  of  the  associated 
processing  will  make  for  a  significant  qualitative  change  in 
how we work and live. We will truly have systems-of-systems 
that  synergistically 
totally  new  and 
unpredictable services.  
 
What  will  be  the  platform  or  platforms  that  support  such  a 
vision? One possibility is a global sensing and actuation utility 
connected  to  the  Internet.  Electricity  and  water  are  two 
utilities that can be used for a myriad of purposes. Sensing and 
actuation in the form of an IoT platform will become a utility. 
IoT  will  not  be  seen  as  individual  systems,  but  as  a  critical, 
integrated  infrastructure  upon  which  many  applications  and 
services can run. Some applications will be personalized such 
as digitizing daily life activities, others will be city-wide such 
as  efficient,  delay-free  transportation,  and  others  will  be 
worldwide  such  as  global  delivery  systems.  In  cities  perhaps 
there  will  be  no  traffic  lights  and  even  3D  transportation 
vehicles.  Smart  buildings  will  not  only  control  energy  or 
security,  but  integrate  personal  comfort,  energy  savings, 
security  and  health  and  wellness  aspects  into  convenient  and 
effective  spaces.  Individuals  may  have  patches  of  bionic  skin 
with sensing of physiological parameters being transmitted to 
the  cloud  which  houses  his  digital  health,  and  to  the

nodes,  and  clothes  will  act  as  personalized  input  to  optimize 
city-wide  services  benefiting  both  the  individual  and  society. 
Consequently,  we  will  often  (perhaps  24/7)  be  implicitly 
linked  into  the  new  utility.  Some  examples  of  new  services 
include 
the  right

meeting, exercising, shopping, socializing, or visiting a doctor. 
Sometimes  these  activities  will  be  virtual  activities,  or  even 
include  the  use  of  avatars  or  robots.  Many  outputs  and 
displays  for  users  may  be  holographic.  Credit  cards  should 
disappear and biometrics like voice or retinas will provide safe 
access to buildings, ATMs, and transportation systems.  
 
A  sensing  and  actuation  utility  will  not  only  exist  in  public 
spaces,  but  also  extend  into  the  home,  apartments,  and 
condominiums.    Here  people  will  be  able  to  run  health, 
energy, security, and entertainment apps on the infrastructure. 
Installing and running new apps will be as easy as plugging in 
a  new  toaster  into  the  electric  utility.  One  app  may  help 
monitor  and  control  heart  rate,  another  perform  financial  and 
investments services, another automatically ordering food and 
wine,  or  even  predicting  a  impending  medical  problem  that 
should  be  addressed  early  to  mitigate  or  even  avoid  the 
problem.  Humans  will  often  be  integral  parts  of  the  IoT 
system. The Industrial Internet is also a form of IoT where the 
devices  (things)  are  objects  in  manufacturing  plants,  dispatch 
centers,  process  control  industries,  etc.  Consequently,  in  the 
future  the  scope  of  IoT  is  enormous  and  will  affect  every 
aspect of all our lives. 

III.  RESEARCH 

The  spectrum  of  research  required  to  achieve  IoT  at  the 
scale  envisioned  above  requires  significant  research  along 
many  directions.  In  this  section  problems  and  required 
research  are  highlighted  in  8  topic  areas:  massive  scaling, 
architecture  and  dependencies,  creating  knowledge  and  big 
data,  robustness,  openness,  security,  privacy,  and  human-in-
the-loop.  Each  of  the  topic  discussions  primarily  focuses  on 
new  problems  that  arise  for  future  IoT  systems  of  the  type 
described in Section II. The research topics presented in each 
case are representative and not complete.

As trillions of things (objects) are connected to the Internet it 
is necessary to have an adequate architecture that permits easy

useful 
applications.  How  will  these  objects  interact  in  and  across 
applications [37]? Many times, things or sets of things must be 
disjoint  and  protected  from  other  devices.    At  other  times  it 
makes  sense  to  share  devices  and  information.  One  possible 
architectural  approach  for  IoT  is 
the 
smartphone  world  [2][4].  Smartphones  employ  an  approach 
where applications are implemented and  made available from 
an  app  store.  This  has  many  advantages  including  an 
unbounded development of novel applications that can execute 
on  the  smartphones.  Various  standards  and  automatic  checks 
are  made  to  ensure  that  an  app  can  execute  on  a  given 
platform.  For  example,  the  correct  version  of  the  underlying 
OS  and  the  required  sensors  and  actuators  can  be  checked 
when  the  app  is  installed  [12].  A  similar  architectural 
approach  for  IoT  would  also  have  similar  advantages. 
However,  the  underlying  platform  for  IoT  is  much  more 
complicated  than  for  smartphones.  Nevertheless,  if  IoT  is 
based  on  an  underlying  sensor  and  actuator  network  that  acts 
as a utility similar to electricity and water, then, different IoT 
applications  can  be  installed  on  this  utility.  While  each 
application  must  solve  its  own  problems,  the  sharing  of  a 
sensing  and  actuation  utility  across  multiple  simultaneously 
running  applications  can  result  in  many  systems-of-systems 
interference  problems,  especially  with 
the  actuators. 
Interferences  arise  from  many  issues,  but  primarily  when  the 
cyber  depends  on  assumptions  about  the  environment,  the 
hardware platform, requirements, naming, control and various 
device  semantics.  Previous  work,  in  general,  has  considered 
relatively simple dependencies related to numbers and types of 
parameters,  versions  of  underlying  operating  systems,  and 
availability  of  correct  underlying  hardware.  Research  is 
needed  to  develop  a  comprehensive  approach  to  specifying, 
detecting,  and  resolving  dependencies  across  applications. 
This  is  especially  important  for  safety  critical  applications  or 
when actuators can cause harm. 
 
Let’s  consider  a  few  examples  of  dependencies  [21][31][32]. 
Assume  that  we  integrate  several  systems  responsible  for 
energy  management  (controlling  thermostats  [17],  windows, 
doors,  and  shades)  and  home  health  care  (controlling  lights, 
TVs,  body  nodes  measuring  heart  rate  and  temperature,  and 
sleep apnea machines [33]). If information can be shared, this 
would  allow  the  energy  management  system  to  adjust  room 
temperature  depending  on  the  physiological  status  of  the

rooms,  and 

residents  as  detected  by  the  home  health  care  system.  Also, 
integration  will  allow  avoiding  negative  consequences.  For 
example,  the  integrated  system  will  not  turn  off  medical 
appliances  to  save  energy  while  they  are  being  used  as 
suggested by the home health care system. In addition to these 
advantages,  all  the  systems  can  share  sensors  and  actuators, 
which  will  reduce  cost  of  deployment,  improve  aesthetics  of 
the 
reduce  channel  contention.  However, 
integrating  multiple  systems  is  very  challenging  as  each 
individual  system  has  its  own  assumptions  and  strategy  to 
control the physical world variables without much knowledge 
of  the  other  systems,  which  leads  to  conflicts  when  these 
systems  are  integrated  without  careful  consideration.  For 
example,  a  home  health  care  application  may  detect 
depression  and  decide  to  turn  on  all  the  lights.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  energy  management  application  may  decide  to  turn 
off lights when no motion is detected. Detecting and resolving 
such  dependency  problems  is  important  for  correctness  of 
operation of interacting IoT systems. 
 

C.  Creating Knowledge and Big Data 

 
In  an  IoT  world  there  will  exist  a  vast  amount  of  raw  data 
being  continuously  collected.  It  will  be  necessary  to  develop 
techniques  that  convert  this  raw  data  into  usable  knowledge. 
For example, in the medical area, raw streams of sensor values 
must  be  converted  into  semantically  meaningful  activities 
performed  by  or  about  a  person  such  as  eating,  poor 
respiration, or exhibiting signs of depression. Main challenges 
for data interpretation and the formation of knowledge include 
addressing  noisy,  physical  world  data  and  developing  new 
inference  techniques  that  do  not  suffer  the  limitations  of 
Bayesian  or  Dempster-Shafer  schemes.  These  limitations 
include the need to know a priori probabilities and the cost of 
computations. Rule based systems may be used, but may also 
be too ad hoc for some applications.  
 
The  amount  of  collected  data  will  be  enormous.  It  can  be 
expected  that  a  very  large  number  of  real-time  sensor  data 
streams will exist, that it will be common for a given stream of 
data  to  be  used  in  many  different  ways  for  many  different 
inference  purposes,  that  the  data  provenance  and  how  it  was 
processed must be known, and that privacy and security must 
be  applied.  Data  mining  techniques  are  expected  to  provide 
the  creation  of  important  knowledge  from  all  this  data. 
Enabling  streams  to  act  as  primitives  for  unexpected  future 
inferences  is  an  interesting  research  problem.  In  addition,  the 
overall  system  solution  must  deal  with  the  fact  that  no 
inference  method  is  100%  correct.  Consequently,  uncertainty 
in  interpreted  data  can  easily  cause  users  not  to  trust  the 
system.   
 
Trust  is  one  important  aspect  of  the  usefulness  of  big  data.  
Security  and  privacy  are  essential  elements  of  trust  and  these 
are  discussed  in  their  own  sections.  However,  as  a  basis  for 
trust  it  is  also  necessary  to  develop  new  in-field  sensor 
calibration 
transport  protocols. 
Without  these  basic  underlying  system-level  capabilities 
further inference  might be operating  with  wrong or too  much

If our vision is correct, many IoT applications will be based on 
a  deployed  sensing,  actuation,  and  communication  platform 
(connecting  a  network  of  things).  In  these  deployments  it  is 
common  for  the  devices  to  know  their  locations,  have 
synchronized  clocks,  know  their  neighbor  devices  when 
cooperating,  and  have  a  coherent  set  of  parameter  settings 
such as consistent sleep/wake-up schedules, appropriate power 
levels  for  communication,  and  pair-wise  security  keys. 
However, over time these conditions can deteriorate. The most 
common (and simple) example of this deterioration problem is 
with clock synchronization [18]. Over time, clock drift causes 
nodes  to  have  different  enough  times  to  result  in  application 
failures.  While 
that  clock 
synchronization  must  re-occur,  this  principle  is  much  more 
general.  For  example,  some  nodes  may  be  physically  moved 
unexpectedly. More and more nodes may become out of place 
over  time.  To  make  system-wide  node  locations  coherent 
again,  node  re-localization  needs  to  occur  (albeit  at  a  much 
slower rate than for clock sync). This issue can be considered 
a  form  of  entropy  where  a  system  will  deteriorate  (tend 
towards  disorder)  unless  energy  in  the  form  of  re-running 
protocols  and  other  self-healing  mechanisms  is  applied  [35]. 
Note that control of actuators can also deteriorate due to their 
controlling  software  and  protocols,  but  also  due  to  physical 
wear and tear. In other words, how can a long-lived, dynamic, 
and mobile IoT be maintained? 
 
The required coherence (entropy) services must combine with 
many  other  approaches  to  produce  robust  system  operation. 
This includes formal methods to develop reliable code, in-situ

techniques,  on-line

missing  data,  resulting  in  wrong  conclusions.  If  these  wrong 
conclusions  drive  actuators  then  serious  safety  problems  can 
occur. One approach is to ensure that all inferred information 
is  accompanied  by  a  confidence  level  in  the  form  of  a 
probability that the information is correct or incorrect and use 
that information to guarantee safe actuator operation. In many 
applications,  informing  users  how  information  was  derived  is 
necessary.  Another  main  challenge  is  making  good  (control) 
decisions  using  the  created  knowledge.  However,  in  making 
decisions  it  is  necessary  to  minimize  the  number  of  false 
negatives  and  false  positives  and  guarantee  safety,  otherwise 
the system will be dismissed as unreliable.  
Many  IoT  applications  will  be  designed  to  work  for  a 
particular  person.  It  is  necessary  to  perform  correct  data 
association  ensuring  that  the  collected  data  and  subsequent 
inferences  are  associated  with  the  correct  individual  or 
individuals.  This  is  a  very  challenging  problem  for  many 
situations.  When  users  are  wearing  RFIDs  or  when  cameras 
with  pattern  recognition  are  used  then  the  problem  is  solved 
(except  for  the  privacy  issues).  However,  in  many  other 
situations  it  will  be  necessary  to  combine  a  set  of  current 
sensor  readings  with  a  trace  of  the  recent  past  readings  and 
utilize  a  history  of  a  given  user’s  activities  and  personal 
characteristics  to  arrive  at  an  accurate  data  assignment.  More 
research is necessary on this problem.

maintenance,  and  general  health  monitoring 
services 
[23][24][25].  These  problems  are  exacerbated  due  to  the 
unattended  operation  of  the  system,  the  need  for  a  long 
lifetime,  the  openness  of  the  systems,  and  the  realities  of  the 
physical  world.  The  goal  is  for  this  collection  of  solutions  to 
create  a  robust  system  in  spite  of  noisy,  faulty  and  non-
deterministic underlying physical world realities.  
 
Another problem barely addressed to date is that in some IoT 
applications,  especially  safety  critical  ones, 
time 
assurances must be given to authorities, e.g., to (re)certify that 
the  system  is  operating  as  expected.  Consider  a  fire  fighting 
system  deployed  in  a  sky  scraper  office  building  to  detect 
fires, alert fire stations and aid in evacuation. Periodically, it is 
necessary  to  demonstrate  to  certification  authorities  that  this 
system  meets  these  requirements.  Such  IoT  applications  will 
need services that can support run time certification. 
 

run 

E.  Openness 

 
Traditionally, the majority of sensor based systems have been 
closed  systems.  For  example,  cars,  airplanes  and  ships  have 
had networked sensor systems that operate largely within that 
vehicle.  However,  these  systems’  capabilities  are  expanding 
rapidly.  Cars  are  automatically  transmitting  maintenance 
information  and  airplanes  are  sending  real-time  jet  engine 
information to manufacturers. There is or will be even greater 
cooperation  and  2-way  control  on  a  wide  scale:  cars  (and 
aircraft)  talking  to  each  other  and  controlling  each  other  to 
avoid collisions, humans exchanging data automatically when 
they  meet  and  this  possibly  affecting  their  next  actions,  and 
physiological  data  uploaded  to  doctors  in  real-time  with  real-
time  feedback  from  the  doctor.  These  systems  require 
openness  to  achieve  these  benefits.  However,  supporting 
openness  creates  many  new  research  problems.  All  of  our 
current composition techniques, analysis techniques and tools 
need  to  be  re-thought  and  developed  to  account  for  this 
openness.  New  unified  communications  interfaces  will  be 
required  to  enable  efficient  information  exchange  across 
diverse  systems.  Of  course,  openness  also  causes  difficulty 
with  security  and  privacy,  the  topics  for  the  next  two 
subsections.  Consequently,  openness  must  provide  a  correct 
balance  between  access  to  functionality  and  security  and 
privacy. 
 
To  better  illustrate  some  of  the  complexities  involved  with 
openness,  consider  feedback  control.  Many  sensor  and 
actuator  systems  heavily  utilize  feedback  control  theory  to 
provide  robust  performance.  The  classical  methodology 
includes  creating  a  model  of  the  system  and  then  deriving  a 
controller  using  well  known  techniques  to  meet  stability, 
overshoot,  settling 
time  and  accuracy  requirements.  A 
sensitivity  analysis  is  also  possible  and  strongly  encouraged. 
However, openness and scale create many difficulties for this 
methodology.  The  openness  means  that  the  model  of  the 
system  is  constantly  changing.  The  human  interaction  is  an 
integral aspect of openness (see Section III H.)  and this makes 
modeling extremely difficult,  and the scaling and interactions 
across  systems  also  dynamically  change  the  models  and 

creates a need for decentralized control. While some work has 
been  performed  in  topics  such  as  stochastic  control,  robust 
control,  distributed  control  and  adaptive  control,  these  areas 
are  not  developed  well  enough  to  support  the  degree  of 
openness and dynamics expected in some IoT sytems. A new 
and  richer  set  of  techniques  and  theory  is  required.  It  is 
especially  important  to  understand  how  large  numbers  of 
control  loops  might  interact  with  each  other.  To  date  there 
have  already  been  examples  where  control  loops  have 
competed  with  each  other,  one  indicating  an  increase  in  a 
control  variable  while  the  other  loop  indicating  a  decrease  in 
the  same  variable  at  the  same  time.  Such  dependencies  (see 
Section  III  B.)  must  be  addressed  in  real-time  and  in  an 
adaptive manner to support the expected openness of IoT. 
 
Openness  is  also  playing  a  major  role  in  industrial  things  on 
the  Internet.  Remote  access  across  factories  or  to  individual 
products  is  often  very  beneficial  to  Industry.  However, 
security  concerns  arise,  especially  if  there  is  any  safety  issue 
involved. 
 

F.  Security 

 
A fundamental problem that is pervasive in the Internet today 
that must be solved is dealing with security attacks  [22] [36]. 
Security  attacks  are  problematic  for  the  IoT  because  of  the 
minimal  capacity  “things”  (devices)  being  used,  the  physical 
accessibility  to  sensors,  actuators  and  objects,  and  the 
openness  of  the  systems,  including  the  fact  that  most  devices 
will  communicate  wirelessly.  The  security  problem  is  further 
exacerbated  because  transient  and  permanent  random  failures 
are  commonplace  and  failures  are  vulnerabilities  that  can  be 
exploited by attackers. However, the considerable redundancy 
that is available creates potential for designing applications to 
continue to provide their specified services even in the face of 
failures.  To  meet  realistic  system  requirements  that  derive 
from  long  lived  and  unattended  operation,  IoT  applications 
must  be  able  to  continue  to  operate  satisfactorily  in  the 
presence  of,  and  to  recover  effectively  from  security  attacks. 
Solutions  may  require  downloading  new  code  [10]  and  this 
itself is open to security attacks. The system must also be able 
to  adapt  to  new  attacks  unanticipated  when  the  system  was 
first deployed. These problems  are beginning to be addressed 
by  work  such  as  that  found  in  [34].  In  [34],  the  system 
operates  with  a  base  level  of  support  including  strong  attack 
detection capabilities. Once an attack is detected then reaction 
to it occurs, by self-healing.   
 
To  heal  from  security  attacks,  a  system  needs  to  detect  the 
attack,  diagnose  the  attack,  and  deploy  countermeasures  and 
repairs, but perform all of this in a lightweight manner due to 
the  types  of  low  capacity  devices  involved.  Most  of  today’s 
mainframe 
heavyweight 
computations and large memory requirements, so solutions for 
IoT  are  major  research  challenges.  Ideally,  for  a  quick 
response,  given  the  real-time  nature  of  many  IoTs,  the 
detection,  countermeasures  and  repairs  must  run  in  real-time 
as  part  of  a  runtime  self-healing  architecture.  Sometimes, 
healing requires re-programming, e.g.,  when an  unanticipated

Abstract—Many 

communities  are  vigorously 
pursuing research topics that contribute to the Internet of Things 
(IoT).  Today,  as  sensing,  actuation,  communication,  and  control 
become  ever  more  sophisticated  and  ubiquitous,  there 
is 
significant overlap in these communities, sometimes from slightly 
different perspectives.  More cooperation between communities is 
encouraged.  To  provide  a  basis  for  discussing  open  research 
problems in IoT, a vision for how IoT could change the world in 
the  distant  future  is  first  presented.  Then,  eight  key  research 
topics are enumerated and research problems within those topics 
are discussed.

such  prominent 

mart  devices.  Smartphones.  Smart  cars.  Smart  homes. 
Smart  cities.  A  smart  world.  These  notions  have  been 
espoused for  many  years.  Achieving these  goals has been 
investigated,  to  date,  by  many  diverse  and  often  disjoint 
research  communities.  Five 
research 
communities are: Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile Computing 
(MC),  Pervasive  Computing  (PC),  Wireless  Sensor  Networks 
(WSN),  and  most  recently,  Cyber  Physical  Systems  (CPS). 
However,  as  technology  and  solutions  progress  in  each  of 
these  fields  there  is  an  increasing  overlap  and  merger  of 
principles  and  research  questions.  Narrow  definitions  of  each 
of  these  fields  are  no  longer  appropriate.  Further,  research  in 
IoT,  PC,  MC,  WSN  and  CPS  often  relies  on  underlying 
technologies  such  as  real-time  computing,  machine  learning, 
security,  privacy,  signal  processing,  big  data,  and  others. 
Consequently, the smart vision of the world involves much of 
computer  science,  computer  engineering,  and  electrical 
engineering.  Greater  interactions  among  these  communities 
will speed progress. 
 
In this paper, as a backdrop to identifying research questions, I 
briefly highlight a vision for a smart world (Section II). I then 
discuss  open  research  questions  categorized  into  8  topics

(Section  III).  The  research  discussed  is  representative  rather 
than  complete.  Two  goals  of  the  paper  are:  (i)  to  highlight  a 
number  of  significant  research  needs  for  future  IoT  systems, 
and  (ii)  to  raise  awareness  of  work  being  performed  across 
various research communities. 

II.  VISION AND IOT SCOPE 

Many  people  [8],  including  myself    [28][29],  hold  the  view 
that  cities  and  the  world  itself  will  be  overlaid  with  sensing 
and  actuation,  many  embedded  in  “things”  creating  what  is 
referred  to  as  a  smart  world.  But  it  is  important  to  note  that 
one  key  issue  is  the  degree  of  the  density  of  sensing  and 
actuation  coverage.  I  believe  that  there  will  be  a  transition 
point  when  the degree of coverage triples or quadruples from 
what  we  have  today.  At  that  time  there  will  be  a  qualitative 
change.  For  example,  today  many  buildings  already  have 
sensors  for  attempting 
to  save  energy  [7][38];  home 
automation is occurring [3]; cars, taxis, and traffic lights have 
devices  to  try  and  improve  safety  and  transportation  [9]; 
people  have  smartphones  with  sensors  for  running  many 
useful apps [2]; industrial plants are connecting to the Internet 
[1];  and  healthcare  services  are  relying  on  increased  home 
sensing  to  support  remote  medicine  and  wellness  [11]. 
However, all of these are just the tip of the iceberg. They are 
all still at early stages of development. The  steady increasing 
density  of  sensing  and  the  sophistication  of  the  associated 
processing  will  make  for  a  significant  qualitative  change  in 
how we work and live. We will truly have systems-of-systems 
that  synergistically 
totally  new  and 
unpredictable services.  
 
What  will  be  the  platform  or  platforms  that  support  such  a 
vision? One possibility is a global sensing and actuation utility 
connected  to  the  Internet.  Electricity  and  water  are  two 
utilities that can be used for a myriad of purposes. Sensing and 
actuation in the form of an IoT platform will become a utility. 
IoT  will  not  be  seen  as  individual  systems,  but  as  a  critical, 
integrated  infrastructure  upon  which  many  applications  and 
services can run. Some applications will be personalized such 
as digitizing daily life activities, others will be city-wide such 
as  efficient,  delay-free  transportation,  and  others  will  be 
worldwide  such  as  global  delivery  systems.  In  cities  perhaps 
there  will  be  no  traffic  lights  and  even  3D  transportation 
vehicles.  Smart  buildings  will  not  only  control  energy  or 
security,  but  integrate  personal  comfort,  energy  savings, 
security  and  health  and  wellness  aspects  into  convenient  and 
effective  spaces.  Individuals  may  have  patches  of  bionic  skin 
with sensing of physiological parameters being transmitted to 
the  cloud  which  houses  his  digital  health,  and  to  the

immediate  and  continuous  access 

surrounding  smart  spaces  for  improved  comfort,  health, 
efficiency,  and  safety.  In  fact,  smart  watches,  phones,  body 
nodes,  and  clothes  will  act  as  personalized  input  to  optimize 
city-wide  services  benefiting  both  the  individual  and  society. 
Consequently,  we  will  often  (perhaps  24/7)  be  implicitly 
linked  into  the  new  utility.  Some  examples  of  new  services 
include 
the  right 
information  for  the  task  at  hand,  be  it,  traveling  to  work  or  a 
meeting, exercising, shopping, socializing, or visiting a doctor. 
Sometimes  these  activities  will  be  virtual  activities,  or  even 
include  the  use  of  avatars  or  robots.  Many  outputs  and 
displays  for  users  may  be  holographic.  Credit  cards  should 
disappear and biometrics like voice or retinas will provide safe 
access to buildings, ATMs, and transportation systems.  
 
A  sensing  and  actuation  utility  will  not  only  exist  in  public 
spaces,  but  also  extend  into  the  home,  apartments,  and 
condominiums.    Here  people  will  be  able  to  run  health, 
energy, security, and entertainment apps on the infrastructure. 
Installing and running new apps will be as easy as plugging in 
a  new  toaster  into  the  electric  utility.  One  app  may  help 
monitor  and  control  heart  rate,  another  perform  financial  and 
investments services, another automatically ordering food and 
wine,  or  even  predicting  a  impending  medical  problem  that 
should  be  addressed  early  to  mitigate  or  even  avoid  the 
problem.  Humans  will  often  be  integral  parts  of  the  IoT 
system. The Industrial Internet is also a form of IoT where the 
devices  (things)  are  objects  in  manufacturing  plants,  dispatch 
centers,  process  control  industries,  etc.  Consequently,  in  the 
future  the  scope  of  IoT  is  enormous  and  will  affect  every 
aspect of all our lives. 

III.  RESEARCH 

The  spectrum  of  research  required  to  achieve  IoT  at  the 
scale  envisioned  above  requires  significant  research  along 
many  directions.  In  this  section  problems  and  required 
research  are  highlighted  in  8  topic  areas:  massive  scaling, 
architecture  and  dependencies,  creating  knowledge  and  big 
data,  robustness,  openness,  security,  privacy,  and  human-in-
the-loop.  Each  of  the  topic  discussions  primarily  focuses  on 
new  problems  that  arise  for  future  IoT  systems  of  the  type 
described in Section II. The research topics presented in each 
case are representative and not complete.

deployed implies that eventually trillions of things  will be on 
the  Internet.  How  to  name,  authenticate  access,  maintain, 
protect, use, and support such a large scale of things are major 
problems. Will IPv6 suffice? Will protocols such a 6LowPAN 
play  a  role?  Will  entirely  new  standards  and  protocols 
emerge? Since many of the things on the Internet will require 
their  own  energy  source,  will  energy  scavenging  and 
enormously 
the  need  for 
batteries? How will the massive amounts of data be collected, 

low  power  circuits  eliminate 

used,  and  stored?  What 
longitudinal  studies  will  be 
performed?  How  will  the  real-time  and  reliability  aspects  be 
supported [5][13]? How will devices including mobile devices 
be  discovered?  Will  the  emergence  of  a  utility  model,  if  it 
occurs,  mean entirely new  standards? How  will  such a utility 
be  achieved?  It  is  unlikely  that  any  solution  immediately 
becomes  the  norm.    Many  protocols  and  variations  will  co-
exist. What will be the architectural model that can support the 
expected heterogeneity of devices and applications?  
 

B.  Architecture and Dependencies 

and 

control, 

communications, 

to  borrow  from 

 
As trillions of things (objects) are connected to the Internet it 
is necessary to have an adequate architecture that permits easy 
connectivity, 
useful 
applications.  How  will  these  objects  interact  in  and  across 
applications [37]? Many times, things or sets of things must be 
disjoint  and  protected  from  other  devices.    At  other  times  it 
makes  sense  to  share  devices  and  information.  One  possible 
architectural  approach  for  IoT  is 
the 
smartphone  world  [2][4].  Smartphones  employ  an  approach 
where applications are implemented and  made available from 
an  app  store.  This  has  many  advantages  including  an 
unbounded development of novel applications that can execute 
on  the  smartphones.  Various  standards  and  automatic  checks 
are  made  to  ensure  that  an  app  can  execute  on  a  given 
platform.  For  example,  the  correct  version  of  the  underlying 
OS  and  the  required  sensors  and  actuators  can  be  checked 
when  the  app  is  installed  [12].  A  similar  architectural 
approach  for  IoT  would  also  have  similar  advantages. 
However,  the  underlying  platform  for  IoT  is  much  more 
complicated  than  for  smartphones.  Nevertheless,  if  IoT  is 
based  on  an  underlying  sensor  and  actuator  network  that  acts 
as a utility similar to electricity and water, then, different IoT 
applications  can  be  installed  on  this  utility.  While  each 
application  must  solve  its  own  problems,  the  sharing  of  a 
sensing  and  actuation  utility  across  multiple  simultaneously 
running  applications  can  result  in  many  systems-of-systems 
interference  problems,  especially  with 
the  actuators. 
Interferences  arise  from  many  issues,  but  primarily  when  the 
cyber  depends  on  assumptions  about  the  environment,  the 
hardware platform, requirements, naming, control and various 
device  semantics.  Previous  work,  in  general,  has  considered 
relatively simple dependencies related to numbers and types of 
parameters,  versions  of  underlying  operating  systems,  and 
availability  of  correct  underlying  hardware.  Research  is 
needed  to  develop  a  comprehensive  approach  to  specifying, 
detecting,  and  resolving  dependencies  across  applications. 
This  is  especially  important  for  safety  critical  applications  or 
when actuators can cause harm. 
 
Let’s  consider  a  few  examples  of  dependencies  [21][31][32]. 
Assume  that  we  integrate  several  systems  responsible  for 
energy  management  (controlling  thermostats  [17],  windows, 
doors,  and  shades)  and  home  health  care  (controlling  lights, 
TVs,  body  nodes  measuring  heart  rate  and  temperature,  and 
sleep apnea machines [33]). If information can be shared, this 
would  allow  the  energy  management  system  to  adjust  room 
temperature  depending  on  the  physiological  status  of  the

rooms,  and 

residents  as  detected  by  the  home  health  care  system.  Also, 
integration  will  allow  avoiding  negative  consequences.  For 
example,  the  integrated  system  will  not  turn  off  medical 
appliances  to  save  energy  while  they  are  being  used  as 
suggested by the home health care system. In addition to these 
advantages,  all  the  systems  can  share  sensors  and  actuators, 
which  will  reduce  cost  of  deployment,  improve  aesthetics  of 
the 
reduce  channel  contention.  However, 
integrating  multiple  systems  is  very  challenging  as  each 
individual  system  has  its  own  assumptions  and  strategy  to 
control the physical world variables without much knowledge 
of  the  other  systems,  which  leads  to  conflicts  when  these 
systems  are  integrated  without  careful  consideration.  For 
example,  a  home  health  care  application  may  detect 
depression  and  decide  to  turn  on  all  the  lights.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  energy  management  application  may  decide  to  turn 
off lights when no motion is detected. Detecting and resolving 
such  dependency  problems  is  important  for  correctness  of 
operation of interacting IoT systems. 
 

C.  Creating Knowledge and Big Data 

 
In  an  IoT  world  there  will  exist  a  vast  amount  of  raw  data 
being  continuously  collected.  It  will  be  necessary  to  develop 
techniques  that  convert  this  raw  data  into  usable  knowledge. 
For example, in the medical area, raw streams of sensor values 
must  be  converted  into  semantically  meaningful  activities 
performed  by  or  about  a  person  such  as  eating,  poor 
respiration, or exhibiting signs of depression. Main challenges 
for data interpretation and the formation of knowledge include 
addressing  noisy,  physical  world  data  and  developing  new 
inference  techniques  that  do  not  suffer  the  limitations  of 
Bayesian  or  Dempster-Shafer  schemes.  These  limitations 
include the need to know a priori probabilities and the cost of 
computations. Rule based systems may be used, but may also 
be too ad hoc for some applications.  
 
The  amount  of  collected  data  will  be  enormous.  It  can  be 
expected  that  a  very  large  number  of  real-time  sensor  data 
streams will exist, that it will be common for a given stream of 
data  to  be  used  in  many  different  ways  for  many  different 
inference  purposes,  that  the  data  provenance  and  how  it  was 
processed must be known, and that privacy and security must 
be  applied.  Data  mining  techniques  are  expected  to  provide 
the  creation  of  important  knowledge  from  all  this  data. 
Enabling  streams  to  act  as  primitives  for  unexpected  future 
inferences  is  an  interesting  research  problem.  In  addition,  the 
overall  system  solution  must  deal  with  the  fact  that  no 
inference  method  is  100%  correct.  Consequently,  uncertainty 
in  interpreted  data  can  easily  cause  users  not  to  trust  the 
system.   
 
Trust  is  one  important  aspect  of  the  usefulness  of  big  data.  
Security  and  privacy  are  essential  elements  of  trust  and  these 
are  discussed  in  their  own  sections.  However,  as  a  basis  for 
trust  it  is  also  necessary  to  develop  new  in-field  sensor 
calibration 
transport  protocols. 
Without  these  basic  underlying  system-level  capabilities 
further inference  might be operating  with  wrong or too  much 

techniques  and

is  widely 

 
If our vision is correct, many IoT applications will be based on 
a  deployed  sensing,  actuation,  and  communication  platform 
(connecting  a  network  of  things).  In  these  deployments  it  is 
common  for  the  devices  to  know  their  locations,  have 
synchronized  clocks,  know  their  neighbor  devices  when 
cooperating,  and  have  a  coherent  set  of  parameter  settings 
such as consistent sleep/wake-up schedules, appropriate power 
levels  for  communication,  and  pair-wise  security  keys. 
However, over time these conditions can deteriorate. The most 
common (and simple) example of this deterioration problem is 
with clock synchronization [18]. Over time, clock drift causes 
nodes  to  have  different  enough  times  to  result  in  application 
failures.  While 
that  clock 
synchronization  must  re-occur,  this  principle  is  much  more 
general.  For  example,  some  nodes  may  be  physically  moved 
unexpectedly. More and more nodes may become out of place 
over  time.  To  make  system-wide  node  locations  coherent 
again,  node  re-localization  needs  to  occur  (albeit  at  a  much 
slower rate than for clock sync). This issue can be considered 
a  form  of  entropy  where  a  system  will  deteriorate  (tend 
towards  disorder)  unless  energy  in  the  form  of  re-running 
protocols  and  other  self-healing  mechanisms  is  applied  [35]. 
Note that control of actuators can also deteriorate due to their 
controlling  software  and  protocols,  but  also  due  to  physical 
wear and tear. In other words, how can a long-lived, dynamic, 
and mobile IoT be maintained? 
 
The required coherence (entropy) services must combine with 
many  other  approaches  to  produce  robust  system  operation. 
This includes formal methods to develop reliable code, in-situ 
debugging 
in-field-

techniques,  on-line

missing  data,  resulting  in  wrong  conclusions.  If  these  wrong 
conclusions  drive  actuators  then  serious  safety  problems  can 
occur. One approach is to ensure that all inferred information 
is  accompanied  by  a  confidence  level  in  the  form  of  a 
probability that the information is correct or incorrect and use 
that information to guarantee safe actuator operation. In many 
applications,  informing  users  how  information  was  derived  is 
necessary.  Another  main  challenge  is  making  good  (control) 
decisions  using  the  created  knowledge.  However,  in  making 
decisions  it  is  necessary  to  minimize  the  number  of  false 
negatives  and  false  positives  and  guarantee  safety,  otherwise 
the system will be dismissed as unreliable.  
Many  IoT  applications  will  be  designed  to  work  for  a 
particular  person.  It  is  necessary  to  perform  correct  data 
association  ensuring  that  the  collected  data  and  subsequent 
inferences  are  associated  with  the  correct  individual  or 
individuals.  This  is  a  very  challenging  problem  for  many 
situations.  When  users  are  wearing  RFIDs  or  when  cameras 
with  pattern  recognition  are  used  then  the  problem  is  solved 
(except  for  the  privacy  issues).  However,  in  many  other 
situations  it  will  be  necessary  to  combine  a  set  of  current 
sensor  readings  with  a  trace  of  the  recent  past  readings  and 
utilize  a  history  of  a  given  user’s  activities  and  personal 
characteristics  to  arrive  at  an  accurate  data  assignment.  More 
research is necessary on this problem.

maintenance,  and  general  health  monitoring 
services 
[23][24][25].  These  problems  are  exacerbated  due  to  the 
unattended  operation  of  the  system,  the  need  for  a  long 
lifetime,  the  openness  of  the  systems,  and  the  realities  of  the 
physical  world.  The  goal  is  for  this  collection  of  solutions  to 
create  a  robust  system  in  spite  of  noisy,  faulty  and  non-
deterministic underlying physical world realities.  
 
Another problem barely addressed to date is that in some IoT 
applications,  especially  safety  critical  ones, 
time 
assurances must be given to authorities, e.g., to (re)certify that 
the  system  is  operating  as  expected.  Consider  a  fire  fighting 
system  deployed  in  a  sky  scraper  office  building  to  detect 
fires, alert fire stations and aid in evacuation. Periodically, it is 
necessary  to  demonstrate  to  certification  authorities  that  this 
system  meets  these  requirements.  Such  IoT  applications  will 
need services that can support run time certification. 
 

run 

E.  Openness 

 
Traditionally, the majority of sensor based systems have been 
closed  systems.  For  example,  cars,  airplanes  and  ships  have 
had networked sensor systems that operate largely within that 
vehicle.  However,  these  systems’  capabilities  are  expanding 
rapidly.  Cars  are  automatically  transmitting  maintenance 
information  and  airplanes  are  sending  real-time  jet  engine 
information to manufacturers. There is or will be even greater 
cooperation  and  2-way  control  on  a  wide  scale:  cars  (and 
aircraft)  talking  to  each  other  and  controlling  each  other  to 
avoid collisions, humans exchanging data automatically when 
they  meet  and  this  possibly  affecting  their  next  actions,  and 
physiological  data  uploaded  to  doctors  in  real-time  with  real-
time  feedback  from  the  doctor.  These  systems  require 
openness  to  achieve  these  benefits.  However,  supporting 
openness  creates  many  new  research  problems.  All  of  our 
current composition techniques, analysis techniques and tools 
need  to  be  re-thought  and  developed  to  account  for  this 
openness.  New  unified  communications  interfaces  will  be 
required  to  enable  efficient  information  exchange  across 
diverse  systems.  Of  course,  openness  also  causes  difficulty 
with  security  and  privacy,  the  topics  for  the  next  two 
subsections.  Consequently,  openness  must  provide  a  correct 
balance  between  access  to  functionality  and  security  and 
privacy. 
 
To  better  illustrate  some  of  the  complexities  involved  with 
openness,  consider  feedback  control.  Many  sensor  and 
actuator  systems  heavily  utilize  feedback  control  theory  to 
provide  robust  performance.  The  classical  methodology 
includes  creating  a  model  of  the  system  and  then  deriving  a 
controller  using  well  known  techniques  to  meet  stability, 
overshoot,  settling 
time  and  accuracy  requirements.  A 
sensitivity  analysis  is  also  possible  and  strongly  encouraged. 
However, openness and scale create many difficulties for this 
methodology.  The  openness  means  that  the  model  of  the 
system  is  constantly  changing.  The  human  interaction  is  an 
integral aspect of openness (see Section III H.)  and this makes 
modeling extremely difficult,  and the scaling and interactions 
across  systems  also  dynamically  change  the  models  and 

creates a need for decentralized control. While some work has 
been  performed  in  topics  such  as  stochastic  control,  robust 
control,  distributed  control  and  adaptive  control,  these  areas 
are  not  developed  well  enough  to  support  the  degree  of 
openness and dynamics expected in some IoT sytems. A new 
and  richer  set  of  techniques  and  theory  is  required.  It  is 
especially  important  to  understand  how  large  numbers  of 
control  loops  might  interact  with  each  other.  To  date  there 
have  already  been  examples  where  control  loops  have 
competed  with  each  other,  one  indicating  an  increase  in  a 
control  variable  while  the  other  loop  indicating  a  decrease  in 
the  same  variable  at  the  same  time.  Such  dependencies  (see 
Section  III  B.)  must  be  addressed  in  real-time  and  in  an 
adaptive manner to support the expected openness of IoT. 
 
Openness  is  also  playing  a  major  role  in  industrial  things  on 
the  Internet.  Remote  access  across  factories  or  to  individual 
products  is  often  very  beneficial  to  Industry.  However, 
security  concerns  arise,  especially  if  there  is  any  safety  issue 
involved. 
 

F.  Security 

 
A fundamental problem that is pervasive in the Internet today 
that must be solved is dealing with security attacks  [22] [36]. 
Security  attacks  are  problematic  for  the  IoT  because  of  the 
minimal  capacity  “things”  (devices)  being  used,  the  physical 
accessibility  to  sensors,  actuators  and  objects,  and  the 
openness  of  the  systems,  including  the  fact  that  most  devices 
will  communicate  wirelessly.  The  security  problem  is  further 
exacerbated  because  transient  and  permanent  random  failures 
are  commonplace  and  failures  are  vulnerabilities  that  can  be 
exploited by attackers. However, the considerable redundancy 
that is available creates potential for designing applications to 
continue to provide their specified services even in the face of 
failures.  To  meet  realistic  system  requirements  that  derive 
from  long  lived  and  unattended  operation,  IoT  applications 
must  be  able  to  continue  to  operate  satisfactorily  in  the 
presence  of,  and  to  recover  effectively  from  security  attacks. 
Solutions  may  require  downloading  new  code  [10]  and  this 
itself is open to security attacks. The system must also be able 
to  adapt  to  new  attacks  unanticipated  when  the  system  was 
first deployed. These problems  are beginning to be addressed 
by  work  such  as  that  found  in  [34].  In  [34],  the  system 
operates  with  a  base  level  of  support  including  strong  attack 
detection capabilities. Once an attack is detected then reaction 
to it occurs, by self-healing.   
 
To  heal  from  security  attacks,  a  system  needs  to  detect  the 
attack,  diagnose  the  attack,  and  deploy  countermeasures  and 
repairs, but perform all of this in a lightweight manner due to 
the  types  of  low  capacity  devices  involved.  Most  of  today’s 
mainframe 
heavyweight 
computations and large memory requirements, so solutions for 
IoT  are  major  research  challenges.  Ideally,  for  a  quick 
response,  given  the  real-time  nature  of  many  IoTs,  the 
detection,  countermeasures  and  repairs  must  run  in  real-time 
as  part  of  a  runtime  self-healing  architecture.  Sometimes, 
healing requires re-programming, e.g.,  when an  unanticipated

attack  occurs.  In  these  cases,  healing  instructions  need  to  be 
securely  (with  authentication  and  attestation)  delivered  to  the 
appropriate nodes and then the node’s running programs need 
to  be  amended  by  the  runtime  architecture.  It  is  likely  that 
significant  hardware  support  [22]  will  be  necessary  for 
providing  encryption,  authentication,  attestation,  and  tamper 
proof  keys.  Even  if  new  devices  are  security-aware,  dealing 
with legacy devices will prove difficult. 
 

G.  Privacy 

 
The  ubiquity  and  interactions  involved  in  IoT  will  provide 
many  conveniences  and  useful  services  for  individuals,  but 
also create many opportunities to violate privacy. To solve the 
privacy problem created by IoT applications of the future, the 
privacy  policies  for  each  (system)  domain  must  be  specified. 
Once specified either the individual IoT application or the IoT 
infrastructure  (e.g., 
the  utility  capability)  must  enforce 
privacy.  Consequently,  the  IoT  paradigm  must  be  able  to 
express  users’  requests  for  data  access  and  the  policies  such 
that the requests can be evaluated against the policies in order 
to decide if they should be granted or denied. A new language 
is  required  to  express  privacy  policies  because  the  following 
requirements  not  easily  expressed 
in  current  privacy 
languages:  

  The need to express the different types of context in 
the  environment  such  as  time,  space,  physiological 
sensing,  environmental  sensing,  and  stream  based 
noisy data. Most of the context needs to be collected 
and  evaluated  in  real-time.  But  what  will  collect 
policies and data and support privacy? Is it the utility 
infrastructure,  an  individual  application,  both,  or 
some new approach?  

  The  need  to  represent  different  types  of  data  owners 
and request subjects in the system as well as external 
users  and  their  rights  when  domains  interact.  Unlike 
other  privacy  enforcing  systems  where  the  subjects 
and data owners are human individuals or groups,  an 
IoT  privacy  language  might  also  support  physical 
entities  such  as  “refrigerator”,  “room”,  “floor”,  and 
other  system  entities  (things)  as  request  issuers  and 
data owners.  

  The need to represent high-level aggregating requests 
such as querying the average, maximum, or minimum 
reading  of  specified  sensing  data.  This  capability 
must  be  supported  by  anonymizing  aggregation 
functions. This capability needs to exist for real-time 
streams and across the big data repositories. Note that 
inference is  very powerful and having access to  vast 
amounts  of  data  and  inference  techniques  it  is  often 
easy to violate privacy in spite of anonymization. 

  The need to support not only adherence to privacy for 
queries of data (pulling data  value  from the  system), 
but  also  privacy  on  requests  to  set  a  system’s 
parameters  (pushing  new  values  to  the  system),  e.g., 
a private use of an actuator. 

  The  need  to  allow  dynamic  changes  to  the  policies, 
and perform a myriad of analyses some of which are 
context dependent.  

 
One  of  the  more  difficult  privacy  problems  is  that  systems 
interact  with  other  systems,  each  having  their  own  privacy 
policies.  Consequently,  inconsistencies  may  arise  across 
systems  in  the  IoT  world.  On-line  consistency  checking  and 
notification and resolution schemes are required.  
 

H.  Humans in the Loop 

i.e.,  humans  and 

its  advantage,  modeling  human  behaviors 

 
As  IoT  applications  proliferate  they  will  become  more 
sophisticated.  Many  of  these  new  applications  will  intimately 
involve  humans, 
things  will  operate 
synergistically.  Human  in-the-loop  systems  offer  exciting 
opportunities to a broad range of applications including energy 
management  [17],  health  care  [15],  and  automobile  systems 
[9][16].  For  example,  it  is  hypothesized  that  explicitly 
incorporating  human-in-the-loop  models  for  driving  can 
improve  safety,  and  using  models  of  activities  of  daily  living 
in  home  health  care  can  improve  medical  conditions  of  the 
elderly  and  keep  them  safe.  Although  having  humans  in  the 
loop  has 
is 
extremely  challenging  due  to  the  complex  physiological, 
psychological  and  behavioral  aspect  of  human  beings.  New 
research  is  necessary  to  raise  human-in-the-loop  control  to  a 
central  principle  in  system  design  and  to  solve  three  main 
challenges [20]. 
 
Challenge 1: The need for a comprehensive understanding of 
the complete spectrum of types of human-in-the-loop controls. 
 
There are many variations for human-in-the-loop controls. We 
need  to  understand  the  complete  spectrum  to  determine  the 
underlying  principles  and  subtleties  that  separate  them. 
Human-in-the-loop  applications  can  be  classified  into  four 
categories:  (i)  applications  where  humans  directly  control  the 
system,  (ii)  applications  where  the  system  passively  monitors 
humans and takes appropriate actions, (iii) applications where 
physiological  parameters  of  the  human  are  modeled,  and  (iv)  
hybrids  of  (i),  (ii),  and  (iii).    Applications  where  humans 
directly  control  the  system  primarily  use  supervisory  control. 
In supervisory control, involvement of  humans takes place  in 
two  ways.  In  one  case,  the  process  runs  autonomously. 
Humans  intervene  with  the  control  algorithm  when  it  is 
necessary  typically  by  adjusting  set  points.  These  control 
problems  are  well  understood.  In  the  second  case,  the 
behaviors of a human are observed, e.g., eating behaviors, and 
interventions  are  controlled  to  improve  their  life.  In  the  third 
case, the process accepts a command, carries out the command 
autonomously,  reports  the  results  and  waits  for  further 
commands  to  be  received  from  the  human.  As  a  concrete 
example,  in  [30],  human-in-the-loop  control  is  used  in  a 
wheelchair-mounted  robotic  arm  to  retrieve  an  object  from  a 
shelf.  In  this  feedback  control  system,  human  provides  input 
via  a  touch  screen  or  joystick  which  is  analyzed  by  a  vision 
processing  system  to  position  the  robotic  arm  to  retrieve  the 
object.  In  this  application,  a  human  directly  controls  the 
controller of the feedback control system and guides it to take 
appropriate action. Applications such as [19] are similar.

Abstract—Many 

communities  are  vigorously 
pursuing research topics that contribute to the Internet of Things 
(IoT).  Today,  as  sensing,  actuation,  communication,  and  control 
become  ever  more  sophisticated  and  ubiquitous,  there 
is 
significant overlap in these communities, sometimes from slightly 
different perspectives.  More cooperation between communities is 
encouraged.  To  provide  a  basis  for  discussing  open  research 
problems in IoT, a vision for how IoT could change the world in 
the  distant  future  is  first  presented.  Then,  eight  key  research 
topics are enumerated and research problems within those topics 
are discussed.

such  prominent 

mart  devices.  Smartphones.  Smart  cars.  Smart  homes. 
Smart  cities.  A  smart  world.  These  notions  have  been 
espoused for  many  years.  Achieving these  goals has been 
investigated,  to  date,  by  many  diverse  and  often  disjoint 
research  communities.  Five 
research 
communities are: Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile Computing 
(MC),  Pervasive  Computing  (PC),  Wireless  Sensor  Networks 
(WSN),  and  most  recently,  Cyber  Physical  Systems  (CPS). 
However,  as  technology  and  solutions  progress  in  each  of 
these  fields  there  is  an  increasing  overlap  and  merger  of 
principles  and  research  questions.  Narrow  definitions  of  each 
of  these  fields  are  no  longer  appropriate.  Further,  research  in 
IoT,  PC,  MC,  WSN  and  CPS  often  relies  on  underlying 
technologies  such  as  real-time  computing,  machine  learning, 
security,  privacy,  signal  processing,  big  data,  and  others. 
Consequently, the smart vision of the world involves much of 
computer  science,  computer  engineering,  and  electrical 
engineering.  Greater  interactions  among  these  communities 
will speed progress. 
 
In this paper, as a backdrop to identifying research questions, I 
briefly highlight a vision for a smart world (Section II). I then 
discuss  open  research  questions  categorized  into  8  topics

(Section  III).  The  research  discussed  is  representative  rather 
than  complete.  Two  goals  of  the  paper  are:  (i)  to  highlight  a 
number  of  significant  research  needs  for  future  IoT  systems, 
and  (ii)  to  raise  awareness  of  work  being  performed  across 
various research communities. 

II.  VISION AND IOT SCOPE 

Many  people  [8],  including  myself    [28][29],  hold  the  view 
that  cities  and  the  world  itself  will  be  overlaid  with  sensing 
and  actuation,  many  embedded  in  “things”  creating  what  is 
referred  to  as  a  smart  world.  But  it  is  important  to  note  that 
one  key  issue  is  the  degree  of  the  density  of  sensing  and 
actuation  coverage.  I  believe  that  there  will  be  a  transition 
point  when  the degree of coverage triples or quadruples from 
what  we  have  today.  At  that  time  there  will  be  a  qualitative 
change.  For  example,  today  many  buildings  already  have 
sensors  for  attempting 
to  save  energy  [7][38];  home 
automation is occurring [3]; cars, taxis, and traffic lights have 
devices  to  try  and  improve  safety  and  transportation  [9]; 
people  have  smartphones  with  sensors  for  running  many 
useful apps [2]; industrial plants are connecting to the Internet 
[1];  and  healthcare  services  are  relying  on  increased  home 
sensing  to  support  remote  medicine  and  wellness  [11]. 
However, all of these are just the tip of the iceberg. They are 
all still at early stages of development. The  steady increasing 
density  of  sensing  and  the  sophistication  of  the  associated 
processing  will  make  for  a  significant  qualitative  change  in 
how we work and live. We will truly have systems-of-systems 
that  synergistically 
totally  new  and 
unpredictable services.  
 
What  will  be  the  platform  or  platforms  that  support  such  a 
vision? One possibility is a global sensing and actuation utility 
connected  to  the  Internet.  Electricity  and  water  are  two 
utilities that can be used for a myriad of purposes. Sensing and 
actuation in the form of an IoT platform will become a utility. 
IoT  will  not  be  seen  as  individual  systems,  but  as  a  critical, 
integrated  infrastructure  upon  which  many  applications  and 
services can run. Some applications will be personalized such 
as digitizing daily life activities, others will be city-wide such 
as  efficient,  delay-free  transportation,  and  others  will  be 
worldwide  such  as  global  delivery  systems.  In  cities  perhaps 
there  will  be  no  traffic  lights  and  even  3D  transportation 
vehicles.  Smart  buildings  will  not  only  control  energy  or 
security,  but  integrate  personal  comfort,  energy  savings, 
security  and  health  and  wellness  aspects  into  convenient  and 
effective  spaces.  Individuals  may  have  patches  of  bionic  skin 
with sensing of physiological parameters being transmitted to 
the  cloud  which  houses  his  digital  health,  and  to  the

to 

immediate  and  continuous  access 

surrounding  smart  spaces  for  improved  comfort,  health, 
efficiency,  and  safety.  In  fact,  smart  watches,  phones,  body 
nodes,  and  clothes  will  act  as  personalized  input  to  optimize 
city-wide  services  benefiting  both  the  individual  and  society. 
Consequently,  we  will  often  (perhaps  24/7)  be  implicitly 
linked  into  the  new  utility.  Some  examples  of  new  services 
include 
the  right 
information  for  the  task  at  hand,  be  it,  traveling  to  work  or  a 
meeting, exercising, shopping, socializing, or visiting a doctor. 
Sometimes  these  activities  will  be  virtual  activities,  or  even 
include  the  use  of  avatars  or  robots.  Many  outputs  and 
displays  for  users  may  be  holographic.  Credit  cards  should 
disappear and biometrics like voice or retinas will provide safe 
access to buildings, ATMs, and transportation systems.  
 
A  sensing  and  actuation  utility  will  not  only  exist  in  public 
spaces,  but  also  extend  into  the  home,  apartments,  and 
condominiums.    Here  people  will  be  able  to  run  health, 
energy, security, and entertainment apps on the infrastructure. 
Installing and running new apps will be as easy as plugging in 
a  new  toaster  into  the  electric  utility.  One  app  may  help 
monitor  and  control  heart  rate,  another  perform  financial  and 
investments services, another automatically ordering food and 
wine,  or  even  predicting  a  impending  medical  problem  that 
should  be  addressed  early  to  mitigate  or  even  avoid  the 
problem.  Humans  will  often  be  integral  parts  of  the  IoT 
system. The Industrial Internet is also a form of IoT where the 
devices  (things)  are  objects  in  manufacturing  plants,  dispatch 
centers,  process  control  industries,  etc.  Consequently,  in  the 
future  the  scope  of  IoT  is  enormous  and  will  affect  every 
aspect of all our lives. 

III.  RESEARCH 

The  spectrum  of  research  required  to  achieve  IoT  at  the 
scale  envisioned  above  requires  significant  research  along 
many  directions.  In  this  section  problems  and  required 
research  are  highlighted  in  8  topic  areas:  massive  scaling, 
architecture  and  dependencies,  creating  knowledge  and  big 
data,  robustness,  openness,  security,  privacy,  and  human-in-
the-loop.  Each  of  the  topic  discussions  primarily  focuses  on 
new  problems  that  arise  for  future  IoT  systems  of  the  type 
described in Section II. The research topics presented in each 
case are representative and not complete.

topics  such  as 

A.  Massive Scaling 

 
The  current  trajectory  of  the  numbers  of  smart  devices  being 
deployed implies that eventually trillions of things  will be on 
the  Internet.  How  to  name,  authenticate  access,  maintain, 
protect, use, and support such a large scale of things are major 
problems. Will IPv6 suffice? Will protocols such a 6LowPAN 
play  a  role?  Will  entirely  new  standards  and  protocols 
emerge? Since many of the things on the Internet will require 
their  own  energy  source,  will  energy  scavenging  and 
enormously 
the  need  for 
batteries? How will the massive amounts of data be collected, 

low  power  circuits  eliminate 

used,  and  stored?  What 
longitudinal  studies  will  be 
performed?  How  will  the  real-time  and  reliability  aspects  be 
supported [5][13]? How will devices including mobile devices 
be  discovered?  Will  the  emergence  of  a  utility  model,  if  it 
occurs,  mean entirely new  standards? How  will  such a utility 
be  achieved?  It  is  unlikely  that  any  solution  immediately 
becomes  the  norm.    Many  protocols  and  variations  will  co-
exist. What will be the architectural model that can support the 
expected heterogeneity of devices and applications?  
 

B.  Architecture and Dependencies 

and 

control, 

communications, 

to  borrow  from 

 
As trillions of things (objects) are connected to the Internet it 
is necessary to have an adequate architecture that permits easy 
connectivity, 
useful 
applications.  How  will  these  objects  interact  in  and  across 
applications [37]? Many times, things or sets of things must be 
disjoint  and  protected  from  other  devices.    At  other  times  it 
makes  sense  to  share  devices  and  information.  One  possible 
architectural  approach  for  IoT  is 
the 
smartphone  world  [2][4].  Smartphones  employ  an  approach 
where applications are implemented and  made available from 
an  app  store.  This  has  many  advantages  including  an 
unbounded development of novel applications that can execute 
on  the  smartphones.  Various  standards  and  automatic  checks 
are  made  to  ensure  that  an  app  can  execute  on  a  given 
platform.  For  example,  the  correct  version  of  the  underlying 
OS  and  the  required  sensors  and  actuators  can  be  checked 
when  the  app  is  installed  [12].  A  similar  architectural 
approach  for  IoT  would  also  have  similar  advantages. 
However,  the  underlying  platform  for  IoT  is  much  more 
complicated  than  for  smartphones.  Nevertheless,  if  IoT  is 
based  on  an  underlying  sensor  and  actuator  network  that  acts 
as a utility similar to electricity and water, then, different IoT 
applications  can  be  installed  on  this  utility.  While  each 
application  must  solve  its  own  problems,  the  sharing  of  a 
sensing  and  actuation  utility  across  multiple  simultaneously 
running  applications  can  result  in  many  systems-of-systems 
interference  problems,  especially  with 
the  actuators. 
Interferences  arise  from  many  issues,  but  primarily  when  the 
cyber  depends  on  assumptions  about  the  environment,  the 
hardware platform, requirements, naming, control and various 
device  semantics.  Previous  work,  in  general,  has  considered 
relatively simple dependencies related to numbers and types of 
parameters,  versions  of  underlying  operating  systems,  and 
availability  of  correct  underlying  hardware.  Research  is 
needed  to  develop  a  comprehensive  approach  to  specifying, 
detecting,  and  resolving  dependencies  across  applications. 
This  is  especially  important  for  safety  critical  applications  or 
when actuators can cause harm. 
 
Let’s  consider  a  few  examples  of  dependencies  [21][31][32]. 
Assume  that  we  integrate  several  systems  responsible  for 
energy  management  (controlling  thermostats  [17],  windows, 
doors,  and  shades)  and  home  health  care  (controlling  lights, 
TVs,  body  nodes  measuring  heart  rate  and  temperature,  and 
sleep apnea machines [33]). If information can be shared, this 
would  allow  the  energy  management  system  to  adjust  room 
temperature  depending  on  the  physiological  status  of  the

rooms,  and 

residents  as  detected  by  the  home  health  care  system.  Also, 
integration  will  allow  avoiding  negative  consequences.  For 
example,  the  integrated  system  will  not  turn  off  medical 
appliances  to  save  energy  while  they  are  being  used  as 
suggested by the home health care system. In addition to these 
advantages,  all  the  systems  can  share  sensors  and  actuators, 
which  will  reduce  cost  of  deployment,  improve  aesthetics  of 
the 
reduce  channel  contention.  However, 
integrating  multiple  systems  is  very  challenging  as  each 
individual  system  has  its  own  assumptions  and  strategy  to 
control the physical world variables without much knowledge 
of  the  other  systems,  which  leads  to  conflicts  when  these 
systems  are  integrated  without  careful  consideration.  For 
example,  a  home  health  care  application  may  detect 
depression  and  decide  to  turn  on  all  the  lights.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  energy  management  application  may  decide  to  turn 
off lights when no motion is detected. Detecting and resolving 
such  dependency  problems  is  important  for  correctness  of 
operation of interacting IoT systems. 
 

C.  Creating Knowledge and Big Data 

 
In  an  IoT  world  there  will  exist  a  vast  amount  of  raw  data 
being  continuously  collected.  It  will  be  necessary  to  develop 
techniques  that  convert  this  raw  data  into  usable  knowledge. 
For example, in the medical area, raw streams of sensor values 
must  be  converted  into  semantically  meaningful  activities 
performed  by  or  about  a  person  such  as  eating,  poor 
respiration, or exhibiting signs of depression. Main challenges 
for data interpretation and the formation of knowledge include 
addressing  noisy,  physical  world  data  and  developing  new 
inference  techniques  that  do  not  suffer  the  limitations  of 
Bayesian  or  Dempster-Shafer  schemes.  These  limitations 
include the need to know a priori probabilities and the cost of 
computations. Rule based systems may be used, but may also 
be too ad hoc for some applications.  
 
The  amount  of  collected  data  will  be  enormous.  It  can  be 
expected  that  a  very  large  number  of  real-time  sensor  data 
streams will exist, that it will be common for a given stream of 
data  to  be  used  in  many  different  ways  for  many  different 
inference  purposes,  that  the  data  provenance  and  how  it  was 
processed must be known, and that privacy and security must 
be  applied.  Data  mining  techniques  are  expected  to  provide 
the  creation  of  important  knowledge  from  all  this  data. 
Enabling  streams  to  act  as  primitives  for  unexpected  future 
inferences  is  an  interesting  research  problem.  In  addition,  the 
overall  system  solution  must  deal  with  the  fact  that  no 
inference  method  is  100%  correct.  Consequently,  uncertainty 
in  interpreted  data  can  easily  cause  users  not  to  trust  the 
system.   
 
Trust  is  one  important  aspect  of  the  usefulness  of  big  data.  
Security  and  privacy  are  essential  elements  of  trust  and  these 
are  discussed  in  their  own  sections.  However,  as  a  basis  for 
trust  it  is  also  necessary  to  develop  new  in-field  sensor 
calibration 
transport  protocols. 
Without  these  basic  underlying  system-level  capabilities 
further inference  might be operating  with  wrong or too  much

If our vision is correct, many IoT applications will be based on 
a  deployed  sensing,  actuation,  and  communication  platform 
(connecting  a  network  of  things).  In  these  deployments  it  is 
common  for  the  devices  to  know  their  locations,  have 
synchronized  clocks,  know  their  neighbor  devices  when 
cooperating,  and  have  a  coherent  set  of  parameter  settings 
such as consistent sleep/wake-up schedules, appropriate power 
levels  for  communication,  and  pair-wise  security  keys. 
However, over time these conditions can deteriorate. The most 
common (and simple) example of this deterioration problem is 
with clock synchronization [18]. Over time, clock drift causes 
nodes  to  have  different  enough  times  to  result  in  application 
failures.  While 
that  clock 
synchronization  must  re-occur,  this  principle  is  much  more 
general.  For  example,  some  nodes  may  be  physically  moved 
unexpectedly. More and more nodes may become out of place 
over  time.  To  make  system-wide  node  locations  coherent 
again,  node  re-localization  needs  to  occur  (albeit  at  a  much 
slower rate than for clock sync). This issue can be considered 
a  form  of  entropy  where  a  system  will  deteriorate  (tend 
towards  disorder)  unless  energy  in  the  form  of  re-running 
protocols  and  other  self-healing  mechanisms  is  applied  [35]. 
Note that control of actuators can also deteriorate due to their 
controlling  software  and  protocols,  but  also  due  to  physical 
wear and tear. In other words, how can a long-lived, dynamic, 
and mobile IoT be maintained? 
 
The required coherence (entropy) services must combine with 
many  other  approaches  to  produce  robust  system  operation. 
This includes formal methods to develop reliable code, in-situ

techniques,  on-line

missing  data,  resulting  in  wrong  conclusions.  If  these  wrong 
conclusions  drive  actuators  then  serious  safety  problems  can 
occur. One approach is to ensure that all inferred information 
is  accompanied  by  a  confidence  level  in  the  form  of  a 
probability that the information is correct or incorrect and use 
that information to guarantee safe actuator operation. In many 
applications,  informing  users  how  information  was  derived  is 
necessary.  Another  main  challenge  is  making  good  (control) 
decisions  using  the  created  knowledge.  However,  in  making 
decisions  it  is  necessary  to  minimize  the  number  of  false 
negatives  and  false  positives  and  guarantee  safety,  otherwise 
the system will be dismissed as unreliable.  
Many  IoT  applications  will  be  designed  to  work  for  a 
particular  person.  It  is  necessary  to  perform  correct  data 
association  ensuring  that  the  collected  data  and  subsequent 
inferences  are  associated  with  the  correct  individual  or 
individuals.  This  is  a  very  challenging  problem  for  many 
situations.  When  users  are  wearing  RFIDs  or  when  cameras 
with  pattern  recognition  are  used  then  the  problem  is  solved 
(except  for  the  privacy  issues).  However,  in  many  other 
situations  it  will  be  necessary  to  combine  a  set  of  current 
sensor  readings  with  a  trace  of  the  recent  past  readings  and 
utilize  a  history  of  a  given  user’s  activities  and  personal 
characteristics  to  arrive  at  an  accurate  data  assignment.  More 
research is necessary on this problem.

maintenance,  and  general  health  monitoring 
services 
[23][24][25].  These  problems  are  exacerbated  due  to  the 
unattended  operation  of  the  system,  the  need  for  a  long 
lifetime,  the  openness  of  the  systems,  and  the  realities  of  the 
physical  world.  The  goal  is  for  this  collection  of  solutions  to 
create  a  robust  system  in  spite  of  noisy,  faulty  and  non-
deterministic underlying physical world realities.  
 
Another problem barely addressed to date is that in some IoT 
applications,  especially  safety  critical  ones, 
time 
assurances must be given to authorities, e.g., to (re)certify that 
the  system  is  operating  as  expected.  Consider  a  fire  fighting 
system  deployed  in  a  sky  scraper  office  building  to  detect 
fires, alert fire stations and aid in evacuation. Periodically, it is 
necessary  to  demonstrate  to  certification  authorities  that  this 
system  meets  these  requirements.  Such  IoT  applications  will 
need services that can support run time certification.

E.  Openness 

 
Traditionally, the majority of sensor based systems have been 
closed  systems.  For  example,  cars,  airplanes  and  ships  have 
had networked sensor systems that operate largely within that 
vehicle.  However,  these  systems’  capabilities  are  expanding 
rapidly.  Cars  are  automatically  transmitting  maintenance 
information  and  airplanes  are  sending  real-time  jet  engine 
information to manufacturers. There is or will be even greater 
cooperation  and  2-way  control  on  a  wide  scale:  cars  (and 
aircraft)  talking  to  each  other  and  controlling  each  other  to 
avoid collisions, humans exchanging data automatically when 
they  meet  and  this  possibly  affecting  their  next  actions,  and 
physiological  data  uploaded  to  doctors  in  real-time  with  real-
time  feedback  from  the  doctor.  These  systems  require 
openness  to  achieve  these  benefits.  However,  supporting 
openness  creates  many  new  research  problems.  All  of  our 
current composition techniques, analysis techniques and tools 
need  to  be  re-thought  and  developed  to  account  for  this 
openness.  New  unified  communications  interfaces  will  be 
required  to  enable  efficient  information  exchange  across 
diverse  systems.  Of  course,  openness  also  causes  difficulty 
with  security  and  privacy,  the  topics  for  the  next  two 
subsections.  Consequently,  openness  must  provide  a  correct 
balance  between  access  to  functionality  and  security  and 
privacy. 
 
To  better  illustrate  some  of  the  complexities  involved  with 
openness,  consider  feedback  control.  Many  sensor  and 
actuator  systems  heavily  utilize  feedback  control  theory  to 
provide  robust  performance.  The  classical  methodology 
includes  creating  a  model  of  the  system  and  then  deriving  a 
controller  using  well  known  techniques  to  meet  stability, 
overshoot,  settling 
time  and  accuracy  requirements.  A 
sensitivity  analysis  is  also  possible  and  strongly  encouraged. 
However, openness and scale create many difficulties for this 
methodology.  The  openness  means  that  the  model  of  the 
system  is  constantly  changing.  The  human  interaction  is  an 
integral aspect of openness (see Section III H.)  and this makes 
modeling extremely difficult,  and the scaling and interactions 
across  systems  also  dynamically  change  the  models  and 

creates a need for decentralized control. While some work has 
been  performed  in  topics  such  as  stochastic  control,  robust 
control,  distributed  control  and  adaptive  control,  these  areas 
are  not  developed  well  enough  to  support  the  degree  of 
openness and dynamics expected in some IoT sytems. A new 
and  richer  set  of  techniques  and  theory  is  required.  It  is 
especially  important  to  understand  how  large  numbers  of 
control  loops  might  interact  with  each  other.  To  date  there 
have  already  been  examples  where  control  loops  have 
competed  with  each  other,  one  indicating  an  increase  in  a 
control  variable  while  the  other  loop  indicating  a  decrease  in 
the  same  variable  at  the  same  time.  Such  dependencies  (see 
Section  III  B.)  must  be  addressed  in  real-time  and  in  an 
adaptive manner to support the expected openness of IoT. 
 
Openness  is  also  playing  a  major  role  in  industrial  things  on 
the  Internet.  Remote  access  across  factories  or  to  individual 
products  is  often  very  beneficial  to  Industry.  However, 
security  concerns  arise,  especially  if  there  is  any  safety  issue 
involved. 
 

F.  Security 

 
A fundamental problem that is pervasive in the Internet today 
that must be solved is dealing with security attacks  [22] [36]. 
Security  attacks  are  problematic  for  the  IoT  because  of  the 
minimal  capacity  “things”  (devices)  being  used,  the  physical 
accessibility  to  sensors,  actuators  and  objects,  and  the 
openness  of  the  systems,  including  the  fact  that  most  devices 
will  communicate  wirelessly.  The  security  problem  is  further 
exacerbated  because  transient  and  permanent  random  failures 
are  commonplace  and  failures  are  vulnerabilities  that  can  be 
exploited by attackers. However, the considerable redundancy 
that is available creates potential for designing applications to 
continue to provide their specified services even in the face of 
failures.  To  meet  realistic  system  requirements  that  derive 
from  long  lived  and  unattended  operation,  IoT  applications 
must  be  able  to  continue  to  operate  satisfactorily  in  the 
presence  of,  and  to  recover  effectively  from  security  attacks. 
Solutions  may  require  downloading  new  code  [10]  and  this 
itself is open to security attacks. The system must also be able 
to  adapt  to  new  attacks  unanticipated  when  the  system  was 
first deployed. These problems  are beginning to be addressed 
by  work  such  as  that  found  in  [34].  In  [34],  the  system 
operates  with  a  base  level  of  support  including  strong  attack 
detection capabilities. Once an attack is detected then reaction 
to it occurs, by self-healing.   
 
To  heal  from  security  attacks,  a  system  needs  to  detect  the 
attack,  diagnose  the  attack,  and  deploy  countermeasures  and 
repairs, but perform all of this in a lightweight manner due to 
the  types  of  low  capacity  devices  involved.  Most  of  today’s 
mainframe 
heavyweight 
computations and large memory requirements, so solutions for 
IoT  are  major  research  challenges.  Ideally,  for  a  quick 
response,  given  the  real-time  nature  of  many  IoTs,  the 
detection,  countermeasures  and  repairs  must  run  in  real-time 
as  part  of  a  runtime  self-healing  architecture.  Sometimes, 
healing requires re-programming, e.g.,  when an  unanticipated

attack  occurs.  In  these  cases,  healing  instructions  need  to  be 
securely  (with  authentication  and  attestation)  delivered  to  the 
appropriate nodes and then the node’s running programs need 
to  be  amended  by  the  runtime  architecture.  It  is  likely  that 
significant  hardware  support  [22]  will  be  necessary  for 
providing  encryption,  authentication,  attestation,  and  tamper 
proof  keys.  Even  if  new  devices  are  security-aware,  dealing 
with legacy devices will prove difficult. 
 

G.  Privacy 

 
The  ubiquity  and  interactions  involved  in  IoT  will  provide 
many  conveniences  and  useful  services  for  individuals,  but 
also create many opportunities to violate privacy. To solve the 
privacy problem created by IoT applications of the future, the 
privacy  policies  for  each  (system)  domain  must  be  specified. 
Once specified either the individual IoT application or the IoT 
infrastructure  (e.g., 
the  utility  capability)  must  enforce 
privacy.  Consequently,  the  IoT  paradigm  must  be  able  to 
express  users’  requests  for  data  access  and  the  policies  such 
that the requests can be evaluated against the policies in order 
to decide if they should be granted or denied. A new language 
is  required  to  express  privacy  policies  because  the  following 
requirements  not  easily  expressed 
in  current  privacy 
languages:  

  The need to express the different types of context in 
the  environment  such  as  time,  space,  physiological 
sensing,  environmental  sensing,  and  stream  based 
noisy data. Most of the context needs to be collected 
and  evaluated  in  real-time.  But  what  will  collect 
policies and data and support privacy? Is it the utility 
infrastructure,  an  individual  application,  both,  or 
some new approach?  

  The  need  to  represent  different  types  of  data  owners 
and request subjects in the system as well as external 
users  and  their  rights  when  domains  interact.  Unlike 
other  privacy  enforcing  systems  where  the  subjects 
and data owners are human individuals or groups,  an 
IoT  privacy  language  might  also  support  physical 
entities  such  as  “refrigerator”,  “room”,  “floor”,  and 
other  system  entities  (things)  as  request  issuers  and 
data owners.  

  The need to represent high-level aggregating requests 
such as querying the average, maximum, or minimum 
reading  of  specified  sensing  data.  This  capability 
must  be  supported  by  anonymizing  aggregation 
functions. This capability needs to exist for real-time 
streams and across the big data repositories. Note that 
inference is  very powerful and having access to  vast 
amounts  of  data  and  inference  techniques  it  is  often 
easy to violate privacy in spite of anonymization. 

  The need to support not only adherence to privacy for 
queries of data (pulling data  value  from the  system), 
but  also  privacy  on  requests  to  set  a  system’s 
parameters  (pushing  new  values  to  the  system),  e.g., 
a private use of an actuator. 

  The  need  to  allow  dynamic  changes  to  the  policies, 
and perform a myriad of analyses some of which are 
context dependent.  

 
One  of  the  more  difficult  privacy  problems  is  that  systems 
interact  with  other  systems,  each  having  their  own  privacy 
policies.  Consequently,  inconsistencies  may  arise  across 
systems  in  the  IoT  world.  On-line  consistency  checking  and 
notification and resolution schemes are required.  
 

H.  Humans in the Loop 

i.e.,  humans  and 

its  advantage,  modeling  human  behaviors 

 
As  IoT  applications  proliferate  they  will  become  more 
sophisticated.  Many  of  these  new  applications  will  intimately 
involve  humans, 
things  will  operate 
synergistically.  Human  in-the-loop  systems  offer  exciting 
opportunities to a broad range of applications including energy 
management  [17],  health  care  [15],  and  automobile  systems 
[9][16].  For  example,  it  is  hypothesized  that  explicitly 
incorporating  human-in-the-loop  models  for  driving  can 
improve  safety,  and  using  models  of  activities  of  daily  living 
in  home  health  care  can  improve  medical  conditions  of  the 
elderly  and  keep  them  safe.  Although  having  humans  in  the 
loop  has 
is 
extremely  challenging  due  to  the  complex  physiological, 
psychological  and  behavioral  aspect  of  human  beings.  New 
research  is  necessary  to  raise  human-in-the-loop  control  to  a 
central  principle  in  system  design  and  to  solve  three  main 
challenges [20]. 
 
Challenge 1: The need for a comprehensive understanding of 
the complete spectrum of types of human-in-the-loop controls. 
 
There are many variations for human-in-the-loop controls. We 
need  to  understand  the  complete  spectrum  to  determine  the 
underlying  principles  and  subtleties  that  separate  them. 
Human-in-the-loop  applications  can  be  classified  into  four 
categories:  (i)  applications  where  humans  directly  control  the 
system,  (ii)  applications  where  the  system  passively  monitors 
humans and takes appropriate actions, (iii) applications where 
physiological  parameters  of  the  human  are  modeled,  and  (iv)  
hybrids  of  (i),  (ii),  and  (iii).    Applications  where  humans 
directly  control  the  system  primarily  use  supervisory  control. 
In supervisory control, involvement of  humans takes place  in 
two  ways.  In  one  case,  the  process  runs  autonomously. 
Humans  intervene  with  the  control  algorithm  when  it  is 
necessary  typically  by  adjusting  set  points.  These  control 
problems  are  well  understood.  In  the  second  case,  the 
behaviors of a human are observed, e.g., eating behaviors, and 
interventions  are  controlled  to  improve  their  life.  In  the  third 
case, the process accepts a command, carries out the command 
autonomously,  reports  the  results  and  waits  for  further 
commands  to  be  received  from  the  human.  As  a  concrete 
example,  in  [30],  human-in-the-loop  control  is  used  in  a 
wheelchair-mounted  robotic  arm  to  retrieve  an  object  from  a 
shelf.  In  this  feedback  control  system,  human  provides  input 
via  a  touch  screen  or  joystick  which  is  analyzed  by  a  vision 
processing  system  to  position  the  robotic  arm  to  retrieve  the 
object.  In  this  application,  a  human  directly  controls  the 
controller of the feedback control system and guides it to take 
appropriate action. Applications such as [19] are similar.

Challenge 2: The need for extensions to system identification 
or other techniques to derive models of human behaviors. 
 
System identification is a powerful technique to create system 
models. It is a new challenge to apply it to human behaviors. 
The  order  and  types  of  equations  to  use,  how  to  produce 
adequate  testing  inputs,  what  output  variables  are  required, 
and how such a model accounts for human traits are unknown. 
If  we  were  to  use  system  identification  technique  to  model  a 
human being who is suffering from depressive illness, it is not 
clear what are the inputs, what are the states and how the state 
transitions 
physiological, 
psychological and environmental factors. If there was a formal 
model of human behavior or even an estimated model, then by 
combining  all  the  factors  that  affect  depression,  we  could 
close the loop by changing the factors in a way that helps the 
patients  and  that  is  based  on  an  established  methodology 
rather  than  ad  hoc  rules.  Clustering,  data  mining,  inference, 
first  principle  models  based  on  human  physiology  [14]  and 
behaviors may all be necessary techniques to be enhanced and 
applied  for  different  applications.  Robust  systems  will  likely 
require predictive models to avoid problems before they occur. 
Advances  to  stochastic  model  predictive  control  are  also 
required. It is also unlikely that any models developed initially 
to  design  the  controllers  will  remain  accurate  as  the  system 
and  human  behaviors  evolve  over  time.  Hence,  adaptive 
control with humans-in-the-loop will be necessary. 
 
Challenge 3: Determining how to incorporate human behavior 
models into the formal methodology of feedback control. 
 
In  the  formal  methodology  of  feedback  control  there  are 
several areas where a human model can be placed: 
 

• Outside the loop, 
• Inside the controller, 
• Inside the system model, 
• Inside a transducer, and 
• At various levels in hierarchical control. 

 
The  newest  challenge  seems  to  be  how  to  incorporate  the 
human  behavior  as  part  of  the  system  itself.  Can  we 
define/guarantee/learn the stability, accuracy, settling time and 
overshoot  properties  of  such  systems,  initially  and  as  the 
system  and  human  behavior  evolves?  As  an  example,  [6] 
proposes a procedure to refine user behavior models based on 
reports  of  accidents  and  incidents  that  occur  during  the 
operation  of  electrical  power  system.  This  work  mainly 
focuses  on  using  Components  Model  of  Emotion  (CME)  for 
observing, recording and analyzing the emotional components 
of  the  operator  behavior,  which  can  be  eventually  useful  for 
simulating  dynamic  behavior  of  an  operator  performing  tasks 
in  a  context  that  leads  to  an  error.  If  we  can  model  such  an 
operator  behavior  using  formal  methodology  of  feedback 
control  and  if  we  can  incorporate  these  operator  models  into 
the  system,  we  will  be  able  to  analyze  various  safety 
properties  of  the  overall  system.  See  also  [26]  for  additional 
descriptions of human-in-the-loop systems. 

 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

In  summary,  one  vision  of  the  future  is  that  IoT  becomes  a 
utility  with  increased  sophistication  in  sensing,  actuation, 
communications, control, and in creating knowledge from vast 
amounts  of  data.  This  will  result  in  qualitatively  different 
lifestyles from today. What the lifestyles would be is anyone’s 
guess. It would be fair to say that we cannot predict how lives 
will  change.  We  did  not  predict  the  Internet,  the  Web,  social 
networking,  Facebook,  Twitter,  millions  of  apps 
for 
smartphones,  etc.,  and  these  have  all  qualitatively  changed 
societies’  lifestyle.  New  research  problems  arise  due  to  the 
large  scale  of  devices,  the  connection  of  the  physical  and 
cyber  worlds,  the  openness  of  the  systems  of  systems,  and 
continuing  problems  of  privacy  and  security.  It  is  hoped  that 
there  is  more  cooperation  between  the  research  communities 
in order to solve the  myriad of problems sooner as  well as to 
avoid  re-inventing  the  wheel  when  a  particular  community 
solves a problem.

Abstract—Many 

communities  are  vigorously 
pursuing research topics that contribute to the Internet of Things 
(IoT).  Today,  as  sensing,  actuation,  communication,  and  control 
become  ever  more  sophisticated  and  ubiquitous,  there 
is 
significant overlap in these communities, sometimes from slightly 
different perspectives.  More cooperation between communities is 
encouraged.  To  provide  a  basis  for  discussing  open  research 
problems in IoT, a vision for how IoT could change the world in 
the  distant  future  is  first  presented.  Then,  eight  key  research 
topics are enumerated and research problems within those topics 
are discussed.

such  prominent 

mart  devices.  Smartphones.  Smart  cars.  Smart  homes. 
Smart  cities.  A  smart  world.  These  notions  have  been 
espoused for  many  years.  Achieving these  goals has been 
investigated,  to  date,  by  many  diverse  and  often  disjoint 
research  communities.  Five 
research 
communities are: Internet of Things (IoT), Mobile Computing 
(MC),  Pervasive  Computing  (PC),  Wireless  Sensor  Networks 
(WSN),  and  most  recently,  Cyber  Physical  Systems  (CPS). 
However,  as  technology  and  solutions  progress  in  each  of 
these  fields  there  is  an  increasing  overlap  and  merger  of 
principles  and  research  questions.  Narrow  definitions  of  each 
of  these  fields  are  no  longer  appropriate.  Further,  research  in 
IoT,  PC,  MC,  WSN  and  CPS  often  relies  on  underlying 
technologies  such  as  real-time  computing,  machine  learning, 
security,  privacy,  signal  processing,  big  data,  and  others. 
Consequently, the smart vision of the world involves much of 
computer  science,  computer  engineering,  and  electrical 
engineering.  Greater  interactions  among  these  communities 
will speed progress. 
 
In this paper, as a backdrop to identifying research questions, I 
briefly highlight a vision for a smart world (Section II). I then 
discuss  open  research  questions  categorized  into  8  topics

(Section  III).  The  research  discussed  is  representative  rather 
than  complete.  Two  goals  of  the  paper  are:  (i)  to  highlight  a 
number  of  significant  research  needs  for  future  IoT  systems, 
and  (ii)  to  raise  awareness  of  work  being  performed  across 
various research communities. 

II.  VISION AND IOT SCOPE 

Many  people  [8],  including  myself    [28][29],  hold  the  view 
that  cities  and  the  world  itself  will  be  overlaid  with  sensing 
and  actuation,  many  embedded  in  “things”  creating  what  is 
referred  to  as  a  smart  world.  But  it  is  important  to  note  that 
one  key  issue  is  the  degree  of  the  density  of  sensing  and 
actuation  coverage.  I  believe  that  there  will  be  a  transition 
point  when  the degree of coverage triples or quadruples from 
what  we  have  today.  At  that  time  there  will  be  a  qualitative 
change.  For  example,  today  many  buildings  already  have 
sensors  for  attempting 
to  save  energy  [7][38];  home 
automation is occurring [3]; cars, taxis, and traffic lights have 
devices  to  try  and  improve  safety  and  transportation  [9]; 
people  have  smartphones  with  sensors  for  running  many 
useful apps [2]; industrial plants are connecting to the Internet 
[1];  and  healthcare  services  are  relying  on  increased  home 
sensing  to  support  remote  medicine  and  wellness  [11]. 
However, all of these are just the tip of the iceberg. They are 
all still at early stages of development. The  steady increasing 
density  of  sensing  and  the  sophistication  of  the  associated 
processing  will  make  for  a  significant  qualitative  change  in 
how we work and live. We will truly have systems-of-systems 
that  synergistically 
totally  new  and 
unpredictable services.  
 
What  will  be  the  platform  or  platforms  that  support  such  a 
vision? One possibility is a global sensing and actuation utility 
connected  to  the  Internet.  Electricity  and  water  are  two 
utilities that can be used for a myriad of purposes. Sensing and 
actuation in the form of an IoT platform will become a utility. 
IoT  will  not  be  seen  as  individual  systems,  but  as  a  critical, 
integrated  infrastructure  upon  which  many  applications  and 
services can run. Some applications will be personalized such 
as digitizing daily life activities, others will be city-wide such 
as  efficient,  delay-free  transportation,  and  others  will  be 
worldwide  such  as  global  delivery  systems.  In  cities  perhaps 
there  will  be  no  traffic  lights  and  even  3D  transportation 
vehicles.  Smart  buildings  will  not  only  control  energy  or 
security,  but  integrate  personal  comfort,  energy  savings, 
security  and  health  and  wellness  aspects  into  convenient  and 
effective  spaces.  Individuals  may  have  patches  of  bionic  skin 
with sensing of physiological parameters being transmitted to 
the  cloud  which  houses  his  digital  health,  and  to  the

to 

immediate  and  continuous  access 

surrounding  smart  spaces  for  improved  comfort,  health, 
efficiency,  and  safety.  In  fact,  smart  watches,  phones,  body 
nodes,  and  clothes  will  act  as  personalized  input  to  optimize 
city-wide  services  benefiting  both  the  individual  and  society. 
Consequently,  we  will  often  (perhaps  24/7)  be  implicitly 
linked  into  the  new  utility.  Some  examples  of  new  services 
include 
the  right 
information  for  the  task  at  hand,  be  it,  traveling  to  work  or  a 
meeting, exercising, shopping, socializing, or visiting a doctor. 
Sometimes  these  activities  will  be  virtual  activities,  or  even 
include  the  use  of  avatars  or  robots.  Many  outputs  and 
displays  for  users  may  be  holographic.  Credit  cards  should 
disappear and biometrics like voice or retinas will provide safe 
access to buildings, ATMs, and transportation systems.  
 
A  sensing  and  actuation  utility  will  not  only  exist  in  public 
spaces,  but  also  extend  into  the  home,  apartments,  and 
condominiums.    Here  people  will  be  able  to  run  health, 
energy, security, and entertainment apps on the infrastructure. 
Installing and running new apps will be as easy as plugging in 
a  new  toaster  into  the  electric  utility.  One  app  may  help 
monitor  and  control  heart  rate,  another  perform  financial  and 
investments services, another automatically ordering food and 
wine,  or  even  predicting  a  impending  medical  problem  that 
should  be  addressed  early  to  mitigate  or  even  avoid  the 
problem.  Humans  will  often  be  integral  parts  of  the  IoT 
system. The Industrial Internet is also a form of IoT where the 
devices  (things)  are  objects  in  manufacturing  plants,  dispatch 
centers,  process  control  industries,  etc.  Consequently,  in  the 
future  the  scope  of  IoT  is  enormous  and  will  affect  every 
aspect of all our lives. 

III.  RESEARCH 

The  spectrum  of  research  required  to  achieve  IoT  at  the 
scale  envisioned  above  requires  significant  research  along 
many  directions.  In  this  section  problems  and  required 
research  are  highlighted  in  8  topic  areas:  massive  scaling, 
architecture  and  dependencies,  creating  knowledge  and  big 
data,  robustness,  openness,  security,  privacy,  and  human-in-
the-loop.  Each  of  the  topic  discussions  primarily  focuses  on 
new  problems  that  arise  for  future  IoT  systems  of  the  type 
described in Section II. The research topics presented in each 
case are representative and not complete. 

Many

standards, the impact of privacy laws, and  the cultural impact 
on use of these technologies are outside the scope of the paper. 

topics  such  as 

A.  Massive Scaling 

 
The  current  trajectory  of  the  numbers  of  smart  devices  being 
deployed implies that eventually trillions of things  will be on 
the  Internet.  How  to  name,  authenticate  access,  maintain, 
protect, use, and support such a large scale of things are major 
problems. Will IPv6 suffice? Will protocols such a 6LowPAN 
play  a  role?  Will  entirely  new  standards  and  protocols 
emerge? Since many of the things on the Internet will require 
their  own  energy  source,  will  energy  scavenging  and 
enormously 
the  need  for 
batteries? How will the massive amounts of data be collected, 

low  power  circuits  eliminate 

used,  and  stored?  What 
longitudinal  studies  will  be 
performed?  How  will  the  real-time  and  reliability  aspects  be 
supported [5][13]? How will devices including mobile devices 
be  discovered?  Will  the  emergence  of  a  utility  model,  if  it 
occurs,  mean entirely new  standards? How  will  such a utility 
be  achieved?  It  is  unlikely  that  any  solution  immediately 
becomes  the  norm.    Many  protocols  and  variations  will  co-
exist. What will be the architectural model that can support the 
expected heterogeneity of devices and applications?  
 

B.  Architecture and Dependencies 

and 

control, 

communications, 

to  borrow  from 

 
As trillions of things (objects) are connected to the Internet it 
is necessary to have an adequate architecture that permits easy 
connectivity, 
useful 
applications.  How  will  these  objects  interact  in  and  across 
applications [37]? Many times, things or sets of things must be 
disjoint  and  protected  from  other  devices.    At  other  times  it 
makes  sense  to  share  devices  and  information.  One  possible 
architectural  approach  for  IoT  is 
the 
smartphone  world  [2][4].  Smartphones  employ  an  approach 
where applications are implemented and  made available from 
an  app  store.  This  has  many  advantages  including  an 
unbounded development of novel applications that can execute 
on  the  smartphones.  Various  standards  and  automatic  checks 
are  made  to  ensure  that  an  app  can  execute  on  a  given 
platform.  For  example,  the  correct  version  of  the  underlying 
OS  and  the  required  sensors  and  actuators  can  be  checked 
when  the  app  is  installed  [12].  A  similar  architectural 
approach  for  IoT  would  also  have  similar  advantages. 
However,  the  underlying  platform  for  IoT  is  much  more 
complicated  than  for  smartphones.  Nevertheless,  if  IoT  is 
based  on  an  underlying  sensor  and  actuator  network  that  acts 
as a utility similar to electricity and water, then, different IoT 
applications  can  be  installed  on  this  utility.  While  each 
application  must  solve  its  own  problems,  the  sharing  of  a 
sensing  and  actuation  utility  across  multiple  simultaneously 
running  applications  can  result  in  many  systems-of-systems 
interference  problems,  especially  with 
the  actuators. 
Interferences  arise  from  many  issues,  but  primarily  when  the 
cyber  depends  on  assumptions  about  the  environment,  the 
hardware platform, requirements, naming, control and various 
device  semantics.  Previous  work,  in  general,  has  considered 
relatively simple dependencies related to numbers and types of 
parameters,  versions  of  underlying  operating  systems,  and 
availability  of  correct  underlying  hardware.  Research  is 
needed  to  develop  a  comprehensive  approach  to  specifying, 
detecting,  and  resolving  dependencies  across  applications. 
This  is  especially  important  for  safety  critical  applications  or 
when actuators can cause harm. 
 
Let’s  consider  a  few  examples  of  dependencies  [21][31][32]. 
Assume  that  we  integrate  several  systems  responsible  for 
energy  management  (controlling  thermostats  [17],  windows, 
doors,  and  shades)  and  home  health  care  (controlling  lights, 
TVs,  body  nodes  measuring  heart  rate  and  temperature,  and 
sleep apnea machines [33]). If information can be shared, this 
would  allow  the  energy  management  system  to  adjust  room 
temperature  depending  on  the  physiological  status  of  the

rooms,  and 

residents  as  detected  by  the  home  health  care  system.  Also, 
integration  will  allow  avoiding  negative  consequences.  For 
example,  the  integrated  system  will  not  turn  off  medical 
appliances  to  save  energy  while  they  are  being  used  as 
suggested by the home health care system. In addition to these 
advantages,  all  the  systems  can  share  sensors  and  actuators, 
which  will  reduce  cost  of  deployment,  improve  aesthetics  of 
the 
reduce  channel  contention.  However, 
integrating  multiple  systems  is  very  challenging  as  each 
individual  system  has  its  own  assumptions  and  strategy  to 
control the physical world variables without much knowledge 
of  the  other  systems,  which  leads  to  conflicts  when  these 
systems  are  integrated  without  careful  consideration.  For 
example,  a  home  health  care  application  may  detect 
depression  and  decide  to  turn  on  all  the  lights.  On  the  other 
hand,  the  energy  management  application  may  decide  to  turn 
off lights when no motion is detected. Detecting and resolving 
such  dependency  problems  is  important  for  correctness  of 
operation of interacting IoT systems. 
 

C.  Creating Knowledge and Big Data 

 
In  an  IoT  world  there  will  exist  a  vast  amount  of  raw  data 
being  continuously  collected.  It  will  be  necessary  to  develop 
techniques  that  convert  this  raw  data  into  usable  knowledge. 
For example, in the medical area, raw streams of sensor values 
must  be  converted  into  semantically  meaningful  activities 
performed  by  or  about  a  person  such  as  eating,  poor 
respiration, or exhibiting signs of depression. Main challenges 
for data interpretation and the formation of knowledge include 
addressing  noisy,  physical  world  data  and  developing  new 
inference  techniques  that  do  not  suffer  the  limitations  of 
Bayesian  or  Dempster-Shafer  schemes.  These  limitations 
include the need to know a priori probabilities and the cost of 
computations. Rule based systems may be used, but may also 
be too ad hoc for some applications.  
 
The  amount  of  collected  data  will  be  enormous.  It  can  be 
expected  that  a  very  large  number  of  real-time  sensor  data 
streams will exist, that it will be common for a given stream of 
data  to  be  used  in  many  different  ways  for  many  different 
inference  purposes,  that  the  data  provenance  and  how  it  was 
processed must be known, and that privacy and security must 
be  applied.  Data  mining  techniques  are  expected  to  provide 
the  creation  of  important  knowledge  from  all  this  data. 
Enabling  streams  to  act  as  primitives  for  unexpected  future 
inferences  is  an  interesting  research  problem.  In  addition,  the 
overall  system  solution  must  deal  with  the  fact  that  no 
inference  method  is  100%  correct.  Consequently,  uncertainty 
in  interpreted  data  can  easily  cause  users  not  to  trust  the 
system.   
 
Trust  is  one  important  aspect  of  the  usefulness  of  big  data.  
Security  and  privacy  are  essential  elements  of  trust  and  these 
are  discussed  in  their  own  sections.  However,  as  a  basis  for 
trust  it  is  also  necessary  to  develop  new  in-field  sensor 
calibration 
transport  protocols. 
Without  these  basic  underlying  system-level  capabilities 
further inference  might be operating  with  wrong or too  much

If our vision is correct, many IoT applications will be based on 
a  deployed  sensing,  actuation,  and  communication  platform 
(connecting  a  network  of  things).  In  these  deployments  it  is 
common  for  the  devices  to  know  their  locations,  have 
synchronized  clocks,  know  their  neighbor  devices  when 
cooperating,  and  have  a  coherent  set  of  parameter  settings 
such as consistent sleep/wake-up schedules, appropriate power 
levels  for  communication,  and  pair-wise  security  keys. 
However, over time these conditions can deteriorate. The most 
common (and simple) example of this deterioration problem is 
with clock synchronization [18]. Over time, clock drift causes 
nodes  to  have  different  enough  times  to  result  in  application 
failures.  While 
that  clock 
synchronization  must  re-occur,  this  principle  is  much  more 
general.  For  example,  some  nodes  may  be  physically  moved 
unexpectedly. More and more nodes may become out of place 
over  time.  To  make  system-wide  node  locations  coherent 
again,  node  re-localization  needs  to  occur  (albeit  at  a  much 
slower rate than for clock sync). This issue can be considered 
a  form  of  entropy  where  a  system  will  deteriorate  (tend 
towards  disorder)  unless  energy  in  the  form  of  re-running 
protocols  and  other  self-healing  mechanisms  is  applied  [35]. 
Note that control of actuators can also deteriorate due to their 
controlling  software  and  protocols,  but  also  due  to  physical 
wear and tear. In other words, how can a long-lived, dynamic, 
and mobile IoT be maintained? 
 
The required coherence (entropy) services must combine with 
many  other  approaches  to  produce  robust  system  operation. 
This includes formal methods to develop reliable code, in-situ

techniques,  on-line

missing  data,  resulting  in  wrong  conclusions.  If  these  wrong 
conclusions  drive  actuators  then  serious  safety  problems  can 
occur. One approach is to ensure that all inferred information 
is  accompanied  by  a  confidence  level  in  the  form  of  a 
probability that the information is correct or incorrect and use 
that information to guarantee safe actuator operation. In many 
applications,  informing  users  how  information  was  derived  is 
necessary.  Another  main  challenge  is  making  good  (control) 
decisions  using  the  created  knowledge.  However,  in  making 
decisions  it  is  necessary  to  minimize  the  number  of  false 
negatives  and  false  positives  and  guarantee  safety,  otherwise 
the system will be dismissed as unreliable.  
Many  IoT  applications  will  be  designed  to  work  for  a 
particular  person.  It  is  necessary  to  perform  correct  data 
association  ensuring  that  the  collected  data  and  subsequent 
inferences  are  associated  with  the  correct  individual  or 
individuals.  This  is  a  very  challenging  problem  for  many 
situations.  When  users  are  wearing  RFIDs  or  when  cameras 
with  pattern  recognition  are  used  then  the  problem  is  solved 
(except  for  the  privacy  issues).  However,  in  many  other 
situations  it  will  be  necessary  to  combine  a  set  of  current 
sensor  readings  with  a  trace  of  the  recent  past  readings  and 
utilize  a  history  of  a  given  user’s  activities  and  personal 
characteristics  to  arrive  at  an  accurate  data  assignment.  More 
research is necessary on this problem.

maintenance,  and  general  health  monitoring 
services 
[23][24][25].  These  problems  are  exacerbated  due  to  the 
unattended  operation  of  the  system,  the  need  for  a  long 
lifetime,  the  openness  of  the  systems,  and  the  realities  of  the 
physical  world.  The  goal  is  for  this  collection  of  solutions  to 
create  a  robust  system  in  spite  of  noisy,  faulty  and  non-
deterministic underlying physical world realities.  
 
Another problem barely addressed to date is that in some IoT 
applications,  especially  safety  critical  ones, 
time 
assurances must be given to authorities, e.g., to (re)certify that 
the  system  is  operating  as  expected.  Consider  a  fire  fighting 
system  deployed  in  a  sky  scraper  office  building  to  detect 
fires, alert fire stations and aid in evacuation. Periodically, it is 
necessary  to  demonstrate  to  certification  authorities  that  this 
system  meets  these  requirements.  Such  IoT  applications  will 
need services that can support run time certification.

E.  Openness 

 
Traditionally, the majority of sensor based systems have been 
closed  systems.  For  example,  cars,  airplanes  and  ships  have 
had networked sensor systems that operate largely within that 
vehicle.  However,  these  systems’  capabilities  are  expanding 
rapidly.  Cars  are  automatically  transmitting  maintenance 
information  and  airplanes  are  sending  real-time  jet  engine 
information to manufacturers. There is or will be even greater 
cooperation  and  2-way  control  on  a  wide  scale:  cars  (and 
aircraft)  talking  to  each  other  and  controlling  each  other  to 
avoid collisions, humans exchanging data automatically when 
they  meet  and  this  possibly  affecting  their  next  actions,  and 
physiological  data  uploaded  to  doctors  in  real-time  with  real-
time  feedback  from  the  doctor.  These  systems  require 
openness  to  achieve  these  benefits.  However,  supporting 
openness  creates  many  new  research  problems.  All  of  our 
current composition techniques, analysis techniques and tools 
need  to  be  re-thought  and  developed  to  account  for  this 
openness.  New  unified  communications  interfaces  will  be 
required  to  enable  efficient  information  exchange  across 
diverse  systems.  Of  course,  openness  also  causes  difficulty 
with  security  and  privacy,  the  topics  for  the  next  two 
subsections.  Consequently,  openness  must  provide  a  correct 
balance  between  access  to  functionality  and  security  and 
privacy. 
 
To  better  illustrate  some  of  the  complexities  involved  with 
openness,  consider  feedback  control.  Many  sensor  and 
actuator  systems  heavily  utilize  feedback  control  theory  to 
provide  robust  performance.  The  classical  methodology 
includes  creating  a  model  of  the  system  and  then  deriving  a 
controller  using  well  known  techniques  to  meet  stability, 
overshoot,  settling 
time  and  accuracy  requirements.  A 
sensitivity  analysis  is  also  possible  and  strongly  encouraged. 
However, openness and scale create many difficulties for this 
methodology.  The  openness  means  that  the  model  of  the 
system  is  constantly  changing.  The  human  interaction  is  an 
integral aspect of openness (see Section III H.)  and this makes 
modeling extremely difficult,  and the scaling and interactions 
across  systems  also  dynamically  change  the  models  and 

creates a need for decentralized control. While some work has 
been  performed  in  topics  such  as  stochastic  control,  robust 
control,  distributed  control  and  adaptive  control,  these  areas 
are  not  developed  well  enough  to  support  the  degree  of 
openness and dynamics expected in some IoT sytems. A new 
and  richer  set  of  techniques  and  theory  is  required.  It  is 
especially  important  to  understand  how  large  numbers  of 
control  loops  might  interact  with  each  other.  To  date  there 
have  already  been  examples  where  control  loops  have 
competed  with  each  other,  one  indicating  an  increase  in  a 
control  variable  while  the  other  loop  indicating  a  decrease  in 
the  same  variable  at  the  same  time.  Such  dependencies  (see 
Section  III  B.)  must  be  addressed  in  real-time  and  in  an 
adaptive manner to support the expected openness of IoT. 
 
Openness  is  also  playing  a  major  role  in  industrial  things  on 
the  Internet.  Remote  access  across  factories  or  to  individual 
products  is  often  very  beneficial  to  Industry.  However, 
security  concerns  arise,  especially  if  there  is  any  safety  issue 
involved. 
 

F.  Security 

 
A fundamental problem that is pervasive in the Internet today 
that must be solved is dealing with security attacks  [22] [36]. 
Security  attacks  are  problematic  for  the  IoT  because  of  the 
minimal  capacity  “things”  (devices)  being  used,  the  physical 
accessibility  to  sensors,  actuators  and  objects,  and  the 
openness  of  the  systems,  including  the  fact  that  most  devices 
will  communicate  wirelessly.  The  security  problem  is  further 
exacerbated  because  transient  and  permanent  random  failures 
are  commonplace  and  failures  are  vulnerabilities  that  can  be 
exploited by attackers. However, the considerable redundancy 
that is available creates potential for designing applications to 
continue to provide their specified services even in the face of 
failures.  To  meet  realistic  system  requirements  that  derive 
from  long  lived  and  unattended  operation,  IoT  applications 
must  be  able  to  continue  to  operate  satisfactorily  in  the 
presence  of,  and  to  recover  effectively  from  security  attacks. 
Solutions  may  require  downloading  new  code  [10]  and  this 
itself is open to security attacks. The system must also be able 
to  adapt  to  new  attacks  unanticipated  when  the  system  was 
first deployed. These problems  are beginning to be addressed 
by  work  such  as  that  found  in  [34].  In  [34],  the  system 
operates  with  a  base  level  of  support  including  strong  attack 
detection capabilities. Once an attack is detected then reaction 
to it occurs, by self-healing.   
 
To  heal  from  security  attacks,  a  system  needs  to  detect  the 
attack,  diagnose  the  attack,  and  deploy  countermeasures  and 
repairs, but perform all of this in a lightweight manner due to 
the  types  of  low  capacity  devices  involved.  Most  of  today’s 
mainframe 
heavyweight 
computations and large memory requirements, so solutions for 
IoT  are  major  research  challenges.  Ideally,  for  a  quick 
response,  given  the  real-time  nature  of  many  IoTs,  the 
detection,  countermeasures  and  repairs  must  run  in  real-time 
as  part  of  a  runtime  self-healing  architecture.  Sometimes, 
healing requires re-programming, e.g.,  when an  unanticipated

attack  occurs.  In  these  cases,  healing  instructions  need  to  be 
securely  (with  authentication  and  attestation)  delivered  to  the 
appropriate nodes and then the node’s running programs need 
to  be  amended  by  the  runtime  architecture.  It  is  likely  that 
significant  hardware  support  [22]  will  be  necessary  for 
providing  encryption,  authentication,  attestation,  and  tamper 
proof  keys.  Even  if  new  devices  are  security-aware,  dealing 
with legacy devices will prove difficult. 
 

G.  Privacy 

 
The  ubiquity  and  interactions  involved  in  IoT  will  provide 
many  conveniences  and  useful  services  for  individuals,  but 
also create many opportunities to violate privacy. To solve the 
privacy problem created by IoT applications of the future, the 
privacy  policies  for  each  (system)  domain  must  be  specified. 
Once specified either the individual IoT application or the IoT 
infrastructure  (e.g., 
the  utility  capability)  must  enforce 
privacy.  Consequently,  the  IoT  paradigm  must  be  able  to 
express  users’  requests  for  data  access  and  the  policies  such 
that the requests can be evaluated against the policies in order 
to decide if they should be granted or denied. A new language 
is  required  to  express  privacy  policies  because  the  following 
requirements  not  easily  expressed 
in  current  privacy 
languages:  

  The need to express the different types of context in 
the  environment  such  as  time,  space,  physiological 
sensing,  environmental  sensing,  and  stream  based 
noisy data. Most of the context needs to be collected 
and  evaluated  in  real-time.  But  what  will  collect 
policies and data and support privacy? Is it the utility 
infrastructure,  an  individual  application,  both,  or 
some new approach?  

  The  need  to  represent  different  types  of  data  owners 
and request subjects in the system as well as external 
users  and  their  rights  when  domains  interact.  Unlike 
other  privacy  enforcing  systems  where  the  subjects 
and data owners are human individuals or groups,  an 
IoT  privacy  language  might  also  support  physical 
entities  such  as  “refrigerator”,  “room”,  “floor”,  and 
other  system  entities  (things)  as  request  issuers  and 
data owners.  

  The need to represent high-level aggregating requests 
such as querying the average, maximum, or minimum 
reading  of  specified  sensing  data.  This  capability 
must  be  supported  by  anonymizing  aggregation 
functions. This capability needs to exist for real-time 
streams and across the big data repositories. Note that 
inference is  very powerful and having access to  vast 
amounts  of  data  and  inference  techniques  it  is  often 
easy to violate privacy in spite of anonymization. 

  The need to support not only adherence to privacy for 
queries of data (pulling data  value  from the  system), 
but  also  privacy  on  requests  to  set  a  system’s 
parameters  (pushing  new  values  to  the  system),  e.g., 
a private use of an actuator. 

  The  need  to  allow  dynamic  changes  to  the  policies, 
and perform a myriad of analyses some of which are 
context dependent.  

 
One  of  the  more  difficult  privacy  problems  is  that  systems 
interact  with  other  systems,  each  having  their  own  privacy 
policies.  Consequently,  inconsistencies  may  arise  across 
systems  in  the  IoT  world.  On-line  consistency  checking  and 
notification and resolution schemes are required.  
 

H.  Humans in the Loop 

i.e.,  humans  and 

its  advantage,  modeling  human  behaviors 

 
As  IoT  applications  proliferate  they  will  become  more 
sophisticated.  Many  of  these  new  applications  will  intimately 
involve  humans, 
things  will  operate 
synergistically.  Human  in-the-loop  systems  offer  exciting 
opportunities to a broad range of applications including energy 
management  [17],  health  care  [15],  and  automobile  systems 
[9][16].  For  example,  it  is  hypothesized  that  explicitly 
incorporating  human-in-the-loop  models  for  driving  can 
improve  safety,  and  using  models  of  activities  of  daily  living 
in  home  health  care  can  improve  medical  conditions  of  the 
elderly  and  keep  them  safe.  Although  having  humans  in  the 
loop  has 
is 
extremely  challenging  due  to  the  complex  physiological, 
psychological  and  behavioral  aspect  of  human  beings.  New 
research  is  necessary  to  raise  human-in-the-loop  control  to  a 
central  principle  in  system  design  and  to  solve  three  main 
challenges [20]. 
 
Challenge 1: The need for a comprehensive understanding of 
the complete spectrum of types of human-in-the-loop controls. 
 
There are many variations for human-in-the-loop controls. We 
need  to  understand  the  complete  spectrum  to  determine  the 
underlying  principles  and  subtleties  that  separate  them. 
Human-in-the-loop  applications  can  be  classified  into  four 
categories:  (i)  applications  where  humans  directly  control  the 
system,  (ii)  applications  where  the  system  passively  monitors 
humans and takes appropriate actions, (iii) applications where 
physiological  parameters  of  the  human  are  modeled,  and  (iv)  
hybrids  of  (i),  (ii),  and  (iii).    Applications  where  humans 
directly  control  the  system  primarily  use  supervisory  control. 
In supervisory control, involvement of  humans takes place  in 
two  ways.  In  one  case,  the  process  runs  autonomously. 
Humans  intervene  with  the  control  algorithm  when  it  is 
necessary  typically  by  adjusting  set  points.  These  control 
problems  are  well  understood.  In  the  second  case,  the 
behaviors of a human are observed, e.g., eating behaviors, and 
interventions  are  controlled  to  improve  their  life.  In  the  third 
case, the process accepts a command, carries out the command 
autonomously,  reports  the  results  and  waits  for  further 
commands  to  be  received  from  the  human.  As  a  concrete 
example,  in  [30],  human-in-the-loop  control  is  used  in  a 
wheelchair-mounted  robotic  arm  to  retrieve  an  object  from  a 
shelf.  In  this  feedback  control  system,  human  provides  input 
via  a  touch  screen  or  joystick  which  is  analyzed  by  a  vision 
processing  system  to  position  the  robotic  arm  to  retrieve  the 
object.  In  this  application,  a  human  directly  controls  the 
controller of the feedback control system and guides it to take 
appropriate action. Applications such as [19] are similar.

Challenge 2: The need for extensions to system identification 
or other techniques to derive models of human behaviors. 
 
System identification is a powerful technique to create system 
models. It is a new challenge to apply it to human behaviors. 
The  order  and  types  of  equations  to  use,  how  to  produce 
adequate  testing  inputs,  what  output  variables  are  required, 
and how such a model accounts for human traits are unknown. 
If  we  were  to  use  system  identification  technique  to  model  a 
human being who is suffering from depressive illness, it is not 
clear what are the inputs, what are the states and how the state 
transitions 
physiological, 
psychological and environmental factors. If there was a formal 
model of human behavior or even an estimated model, then by 
combining  all  the  factors  that  affect  depression,  we  could 
close the loop by changing the factors in a way that helps the 
patients  and  that  is  based  on  an  established  methodology 
rather  than  ad  hoc  rules.  Clustering,  data  mining,  inference, 
first  principle  models  based  on  human  physiology  [14]  and 
behaviors may all be necessary techniques to be enhanced and 
applied  for  different  applications.  Robust  systems  will  likely 
require predictive models to avoid problems before they occur. 
Advances  to  stochastic  model  predictive  control  are  also 
required. It is also unlikely that any models developed initially 
to  design  the  controllers  will  remain  accurate  as  the  system 
and  human  behaviors  evolve  over  time.  Hence,  adaptive 
control with humans-in-the-loop will be necessary. 
 
Challenge 3: Determining how to incorporate human behavior 
models into the formal methodology of feedback control. 
 
In  the  formal  methodology  of  feedback  control  there  are 
several areas where a human model can be placed: 
 

• Outside the loop, 
• Inside the controller, 
• Inside the system model, 
• Inside a transducer, and 
• At various levels in hierarchical control. 

 
The  newest  challenge  seems  to  be  how  to  incorporate  the 
human  behavior  as  part  of  the  system  itself.  Can  we 
define/guarantee/learn the stability, accuracy, settling time and 
overshoot  properties  of  such  systems,  initially  and  as  the 
system  and  human  behavior  evolves?  As  an  example,  [6] 
proposes a procedure to refine user behavior models based on 
reports  of  accidents  and  incidents  that  occur  during  the 
operation  of  electrical  power  system.  This  work  mainly 
focuses  on  using  Components  Model  of  Emotion  (CME)  for 
observing, recording and analyzing the emotional components 
of  the  operator  behavior,  which  can  be  eventually  useful  for 
simulating  dynamic  behavior  of  an  operator  performing  tasks 
in  a  context  that  leads  to  an  error.  If  we  can  model  such  an 
operator  behavior  using  formal  methodology  of  feedback 
control  and  if  we  can  incorporate  these  operator  models  into 
the  system,  we  will  be  able  to  analyze  various  safety 
properties  of  the  overall  system.  See  also  [26]  for  additional 
descriptions of human-in-the-loop systems. 

 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

In  summary,  one  vision  of  the  future  is  that  IoT  becomes  a 
utility  with  increased  sophistication  in  sensing,  actuation, 
communications, control, and in creating knowledge from vast 
amounts  of  data.  This  will  result  in  qualitatively  different 
lifestyles from today. What the lifestyles would be is anyone’s 
guess. It would be fair to say that we cannot predict how lives 
will  change.  We  did  not  predict  the  Internet,  the  Web,  social 
networking,  Facebook,  Twitter,  millions  of  apps 
for 
smartphones,  etc.,  and  these  have  all  qualitatively  changed 
societies’  lifestyle.  New  research  problems  arise  due  to  the 
large  scale  of  devices,  the  connection  of  the  physical  and 
cyber  worlds,  the  openness  of  the  systems  of  systems,  and 
continuing  problems  of  privacy  and  security.  It  is  hoped  that 
there  is  more  cooperation  between  the  research  communities 
in order to solve the  myriad of problems sooner as  well as to 
avoid  re-inventing  the  wheel  when  a  particular  community 
solves a problem.
