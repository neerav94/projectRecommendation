Abstract: Modern agriculture features industrialization, marketized industrial structure, intensive production pattern 
and high digitization; farm produce logistics are characterized by wide range, large quantity, relative independence, 
consumable as well as value-added processing. In this study, in view of the features of modern agriculture and farm 
produce logistics, a SCOR model (Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model) of agricultural products based on the 
Internet of things has been put forward through the improvement of the logistics model of traditional agricultural 
products. The advantages of this model have also been analyzed.

bring unsafe factors, which mainly include: the inputs of 
poisonous  and  harmful  material  residues  during  the 
planting  and  breeding  processes; 
the  effects  of 
environmental  pollutants  to  food  hygiene,  as  pesticide,

Geared  by  the  market,  the  modern  agriculture  meet 
people's  basic  consuming  demands  by  adjusting  the 
agricultural  industry  structure.  The  marketization  of 
agriculture industry is to pick up the leading product and 
develop  market  agriculture  that  integrates  production 
and marketing, as well as a highly open export-oriented 
agriculture, in accordance with the supply and demand 
situation  of  farm  produce  market  and  combining  with 
different  economic  conditions  and  natural  resources  of 
agriculture. 
 
Intension of the agriculture production mode: As one 
of the essential features of modern agriculture, intensive 
production  transformed  the  extensive  production  form 
into mechanized, improved, specialized and large scaled 
production form. 
 
Industrialization  of  modern  agriculture:  Modern 
agriculture  is  a  kind  of  production  operation  system, 
which is integrated with planting, breeding, processing; 
production,  supply  and  sale;  export  and  import  trade; 
agriculture-industry-commerce;

fail to get involved in agricultural products logistics and 
are  forced  to  obey  the  middlemen  or  distributors, 
without  accurate  data  of  marketing  prospect  and 
demands, the initiative of farm is mainly based on the 
price once have, especially the previous year, such kind 
of  production  of  agricultural  products  often  cannot 
reflect  the  true  demands  of  market,  which  cause  the 
blindness of farmer production. 
 
Excessive  intermediate  link:  As  shown  in  above 
figure,  it  is  find  to  need  several  intermediate  link, 
before it reaches the consumers, overmuch intermediate 
link  and  laggard  trade  mode  have  lowered  the  trade 
efficiency and increase the wasting of intermediate link, 
the unit price of agricultural products and the cost. 
 
Low  informationization:  Most  enterprises  in  our 
country  now  did  not  realize  the  significance  of 
informationization  to  their  self  development  and  the 
units  on  agricultural  products  supply  chain  have  no 
information 
information 
communication,  which  lead  to  a  lack  of  necessary 
understanding between enterprises on the farm produce 
supply  chain  and  the  information  of  downriver  and 
upriver  cannot  reach  each  other  smoothly.  As  to  the 
farmers,  the  uncertainty  of  demand  information  and 
uncontrollable intendancy cause wide price fluctuation 
in  the  terminal  market,  which  is  detrimental  to  the 
equilibrium  of  supply  and  demand  in  agricultural 
products.  For  the  consumer,  the  opacity  of  supply 
information 
thorough 
understanding to the product quality. It is for the same 

reason,  that  the  government  suffers  from  inadequate 
supervisor and exorbitant cost. 
 
Miniature  logistics:  Although  the  subject  of  logistics 
are  pluralistic  and  large  scalar,  it  is  small  in  size  and 
week  in  competition.  Though  the  reform  and  open  of 
several  years,  there  are  emerged  a  lot  of  subjects  of 
agricultural  products  logistics,  in  addition  to  the 
traditional  logistics  such  as,  state  business  enterprise, 
suppliers and so on. There are also the great family of 
rural production and operation, the leading corporation 
of agriculture industrialization, professional association 
and professional logistic company, etc., from which we 
can  see  the  subject  of  logistics  are  develop  in  the 
direction  of  diversification. The  logistic  corporation  is 
in large quantities and develop in high speed, however; 
numerous participant individuals and organizations are 
small  scale,  discrete,  low-organizational,  lacking  of 
competition.  So  it  is  difficult  to  deal  with  the  impact 
from  the  market  and  large  logistic  corporation  and  let 
alone compete with large logistic MNC with advanced 
management and operation method. 
 
Product  quality  lacking  of  whole  process  control: 
The

Abstract: Modern agriculture features industrialization, marketized industrial structure, intensive production pattern 
and high digitization; farm produce logistics are characterized by wide range, large quantity, relative independence, 
consumable as well as value-added processing. In this study, in view of the features of modern agriculture and farm 
produce logistics, a SCOR model (Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model) of agricultural products based on the 
Internet of things has been put forward through the improvement of the logistics model of traditional agricultural 
products. The advantages of this model have also been analyzed.

INTRODUCTION 

 

For  food  and  agricultural  products,  the  whole 
procedure  from  production  to  consumption  involves 
production, processing, packing, transportation, storage, 
shelf  display  and  consumption.  Each  link  is  likely  to 
bring unsafe factors, which mainly include: the inputs of 
poisonous  and  harmful  material  residues  during  the 
planting  and  breeding  processes; 
the  effects  of 
environmental  pollutants  to  food  hygiene,  as  pesticide, 
fertilizer  and  other  environmental  pollutants  can  enter 
human  body  through  the  food  chain  and  then  bring 
damage  to  health;  pollution  during  the  processing, 
transportation, 
consumers’ 
requirements  for  the  quality  and  safety  of  food  and 
agricultural products have been improved continuously, 
it is urgent for us to do the whole monitoring for food 
and agricultural products supply chain. The tracking and

Because  the  supply  chain  of  food  and  agricultural

in  the  recent  years.  As  to  main  research  at  home  and 
abroad, such as Amador installs RFID with temperature 
sensor  in  pineapple  corrugated  carton  and  plastic 
turnover  box  (Some  with  sensor  probe  inserted  in  the 
pulp), through the experiment from Costa Rica to United 
States  in  the  long-distance  transportation  we  get  the 
pineapple surface temperature and the pulp temperature 
changes  and 
the  measurement 
accuracy  of  recording  method  compared  with  the 
technology  and  the  traditional  method  (Amador  et  al., 
2009).  Abad  with  others  use  RFID  sensor  with 
temperature,  humidity  and  light  sensor  to  study  the 
technique  of  Internet  of  things’  application  in  an 
intercontinental  transportation  of  the  fresh  fish  from 
South  Africa  to  Europe,  air-land  coordinated  transport 
over a period of 3 days (Abad et al., 2009). Hayes and 
other researchers set temperature sensors of WSN in two 
fishing  boats  and  use  SMS  (text  message)  through  the 
GSM  network  to  transmit  real-time  data  to  Internet 
server  and  record  it,  solving  the  problems  of  past 
method which can only realized single ship monitoring 
system. The technology can be extended to more fishing 
boats’ wide-area monitoring (Hayes et al., 2005). Wang 
xiaodong  and  other  experts  designed 
real-time 
monitoring system based on GPRS technology which is 
suitable  for  the  food  cold  chain  transporter.  The 
temperature monitoring data can be sent to the server of 
the control center (Wang et al., 2009). Shan and others 
studied  application  feasibility  of  Bluetooth,  Zigbee, 
artificial  intelligence,  neural  network  and  fuzzy  logic 
technology  in  the  cold  chain  transportation  and  put 
forward  the  future  application  of  the  Internet  of  things 
technology  in  cold  chain  transport  track  and  the 
technical  scheme  for  automatic  decision-making  ideas 
(Shan et al., 2004). Ruiz-Garcia and others studied the

proposed that we can quickly determine moisture loss in 
product  through  monitoring  the  change  of  moisture 
content  in  air  environment  (Ruiz-Garcia  et  al.,  2008). 
Gras  found  that  if  we  install  passive  RFID  with  a 
temperature sensor in the frozen food packaging, we can 
quickly acquire and record the actual temperature of the 
item,  to  speed  up  the  logistics  (Gras,  2006).  Many 
research results show that the Internet of things is more 
and more widely used in food circulation.

Since  traditional  agriculture  in  our  country  now 
makes  up 
the  development  of 
agricultural products logistics is still backward and fails 
to  form  standard  organization  and  management.  The 
transport  management,  which  lacks  of  wholeness  and 
coordination,  directly  leads  to  hindered  circulation  of 
agricultural products and the increase of cost (Yue and 
Huang,  2004).  The  agriculture  operations  is  mainly 
based  upon 
the  correlating 
agricultural products circulating system characterized as 
"small  scale  and  big  group"  finds  it  more  and  more 
difficult  to  meet  the  demands  of  modern  agricultural 
products  logistics  and  agricultural  industrialization. 
Therefore,  stepping  up  the  development  of  modern 
agriculture  has  become  the  important  strategy  towards 
the building of agricultural power.

ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF  
MODERN AGRICULTURE 

 
Marketization  of  agricultural  industrial  structure: 
Geared  by  the  market,  the  modern  agriculture  meet 
people's  basic  consuming  demands  by  adjusting  the 
agricultural  industry  structure.  The  marketization  of 
agriculture industry is to pick up the leading product and 
develop  market  agriculture  that  integrates  production 
and marketing, as well as a highly open export-oriented 
agriculture, in accordance with the supply and demand 
situation  of  farm  produce  market  and  combining  with 
different  economic  conditions  and  natural  resources  of 
agriculture. 
 
Intension of the agriculture production mode: As one 
of the essential features of modern agriculture, intensive 
production  transformed  the  extensive  production  form 
into mechanized, improved, specialized and large scaled 
production form. 
 
Industrialization  of  modern  agriculture:  Modern 
agriculture  is  a  kind  of  production  operation  system, 
which is integrated with planting, breeding, processing; 
production,  supply  and  sale;  export  and  import  trade; 
agriculture-industry-commerce; 
and 
education.  It 
is  market  oriented,  benefit  focused, 
centering on pillar industries, making rational allocation 
of  production  factors,  practicing  regional  distribution,

farm, 

production, 

integrated  management, 

specialized 
socialized services and entrepreneurial management. 
 
Modern  agriculture  should  be  high  digital:  Modern 
agriculture should be digitized. Digital agriculture refers 
to  a  intensive  agro-technique  supported  by  space  geo-
science  and  science  technology.  What  counts  is  to 
acquired the outputs of farm land crop and the different 
information of space-time environmental factors. Upon 
this  basis,  the  analysis  of  reasons  are  made  and  the 
relevant measures, which should be technically practical 
and  economically  effective,  are  adopted,  namely, 
"prescript farming".

The characteristics of agricultural products logistics: 
Agricultural products logistics is a physical economical 
activity,  which  aims  to  satisfy  consumers  and  realize 
profit,  by 
the  material  object  or 
information  from  producers  to  customers.  It  contains 
several

storage, load and unload, packing, distribution, circulate 
process, retail and information activities etc. During this 
process, the organized goal and increment are achieved. 
The  features  of  our  agricultural  products  is  mainly 
focused on the following aspects: 
 
•  Large scale and wide variety of product logistics 
•  Relative  independence  of  agricultural  products

Problems  of  agricultural  products  logistics:  The 
existing  problems  of  agricultural  products  logistics  in 
our country now are mainly as follows. 
 
Disconnection between production and demand: The 
production  of  agricultural  products,  for  the  most  part, 
fail to get involved in agricultural products logistics and 
are  forced  to  obey  the  middlemen  or  distributors, 
without  accurate  data  of  marketing  prospect  and

price once have, especially the previous year, such kind 
of  production  of  agricultural  products  often  cannot

blindness of farmer production. 
 
Excessive  intermediate  link:  As  shown  in  above 
figure,  it  is  find  to  need  several  intermediate  link, 
before it reaches the consumers, overmuch intermediate

in  the  terminal  market,  which  is  detrimental  to  the 
equilibrium  of  supply  and  demand  in  agricultural 
products.  For  the  consumer,  the  opacity  of  supply

Since  traditional  agriculture  in  our  country  now 
makes  up 
the  development  of 
agricultural products logistics is still backward and fails 
to  form  standard  organization  and  management.  The 
transport  management,  which  lacks  of  wholeness  and 
coordination,  directly  leads  to  hindered  circulation  of 
agricultural products and the increase of cost (Yue and 
Huang,  2004).  The  agriculture  operations  is  mainly 
based  upon 
the  correlating 
agricultural products circulating system characterized as 
"small  scale  and  big  group"  finds  it  more  and  more 
difficult  to  meet  the  demands  of  modern  agricultural

Therefore,  stepping  up  the  development  of  modern 
agriculture  has  become  the  important  strategy  towards 
the building of agricultural power.

ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF  
MODERN AGRICULTURE 

 
Marketization  of  agricultural  industrial  structure: 
Geared  by  the  market,  the  modern  agriculture  meet 
people's  basic  consuming  demands  by  adjusting  the 
agricultural  industry  structure.  The  marketization  of 
agriculture industry is to pick up the leading product and 
develop  market  agriculture  that  integrates  production 
and marketing, as well as a highly open export-oriented 
agriculture, in accordance with the supply and demand 
situation  of  farm  produce  market  and  combining  with 
different  economic  conditions  and  natural  resources  of 
agriculture. 
 
Intension of the agriculture production mode: As one 
of the essential features of modern agriculture, intensive 
production  transformed  the  extensive  production  form 
into mechanized, improved, specialized and large scaled 
production form. 
 
Industrialization  of  modern  agriculture:  Modern 
agriculture  is  a  kind  of  production  operation  system, 
which is integrated with planting, breeding, processing; 
production,  supply  and  sale;  export  and  import  trade; 
agriculture-industry-commerce; 
and 
education.  It 
is  market  oriented,  benefit  focused, 
centering on pillar industries, making rational allocation 
of  production  factors,  practicing  regional  distribution,

socialized services and entrepreneurial management. 
 
Modern  agriculture  should  be  high  digital:  Modern 
agriculture should be digitized. Digital agriculture refers 
to  a  intensive  agro-technique  supported  by  space  geo-
science  and  science  technology.  What  counts  is  to 
acquired the outputs of farm land crop and the different 
information of space-time environmental factors. Upon 
this  basis,  the  analysis  of  reasons  are  made  and  the 
relevant measures, which should be technically practical 
and  economically  effective,  are  adopted,  namely, 
"prescript farming".

The characteristics of agricultural products logistics: 
Agricultural products logistics is a physical economical 
activity,  which  aims  to  satisfy  consumers  and  realize 
profit,  by 
the  material  object  or 
information  from  producers  to  customers.  It  contains 
several 
transportation, 
storage, load and unload, packing, distribution, circulate 
process, retail and information activities etc. During this 
process, the organized goal and increment are achieved. 
The  features  of  our  agricultural  products  is  mainly 
focused on the following aspects: 
 
•  Large scale and wide variety of product logistics 
•  Relative  independence  of  agricultural  products 
logistics  operating.  The  production  of 
farm 
produce,  circulation  and  processing,  packing 
methods,  storage  condition,  as  well  as

•  The  perish-ability  of  the  agricultural  products

Operation  mode  of  agricultural  products  logistics: 
The  present  agricultural  products  logistics  in  our 
country  is  still  on  the  initial  stage,  the  circulation 
system  is  backward,  As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  The  broad

Fig. 1: The present operation mode for modern agricultural products logistics in China 
 
Problems  of  agricultural  products  logistics:  The 
existing  problems  of  agricultural  products  logistics  in 
our country now are mainly as follows. 
 
Disconnection between production and demand: The 
production  of  agricultural  products,  for  the  most  part, 
fail to get involved in agricultural products logistics and 
are  forced  to  obey  the  middlemen  or  distributors, 
without  accurate  data  of  marketing  prospect  and 
demands, the initiative of farm is mainly based on the 
price once have, especially the previous year, such kind 
of  production  of  agricultural  products  often  cannot 
reflect  the  true  demands  of  market,  which  cause  the 
blindness of farmer production. 
 
Excessive  intermediate  link:  As  shown  in  above 
figure,  it  is  find  to  need  several  intermediate  link, 
before it reaches the consumers, overmuch intermediate 
link  and  laggard  trade  mode  have  lowered  the  trade 
efficiency and increase the wasting of intermediate link, 
the unit price of agricultural products and the cost. 
 
Low  informationization:  Most  enterprises  in  our 
country  now  did  not  realize  the  significance  of 
informationization  to  their  self  development  and  the 
units  on  agricultural  products  supply  chain  have  no 
information 
information 
communication,  which  lead  to  a  lack  of  necessary 
understanding between enterprises on the farm produce 
supply  chain  and  the  information  of  downriver  and 
upriver  cannot  reach  each  other  smoothly.  As  to  the 
farmers,  the  uncertainty  of  demand  information  and 
uncontrollable intendancy cause wide price fluctuation 
in  the  terminal  market,  which  is  detrimental  to  the 
equilibrium  of  supply  and  demand  in  agricultural 
products.  For  the  consumer,  the  opacity  of  supply 
information 
thorough 
understanding to the product quality. It is for the same 

reason,  that  the  government  suffers  from  inadequate 
supervisor and exorbitant cost. 
 
Miniature  logistics:  Although  the  subject  of  logistics 
are  pluralistic  and  large  scalar,  it  is  small  in  size  and 
week  in  competition.  Though  the  reform  and  open  of 
several  years,  there  are  emerged  a  lot  of  subjects  of 
agricultural  products  logistics,  in  addition  to  the 
traditional  logistics  such  as,  state  business  enterprise, 
suppliers and so on. There are also the great family of 
rural production and operation, the leading corporation 
of agriculture industrialization, professional association 
and professional logistic company, etc., from which we 
can  see  the  subject  of  logistics  are  develop  in  the 
direction  of  diversification. The  logistic  corporation  is 
in large quantities and develop in high speed, however; 
numerous participant individuals and organizations are 
small  scale,  discrete,  low-organizational,  lacking  of 
competition.  So  it  is  difficult  to  deal  with  the  impact 
from  the  market  and  large  logistic  corporation  and  let 
alone compete with large logistic MNC with advanced 
management and operation method. 
 
Product  quality  lacking  of  whole  process  control: 
The 
fully 
management from farm land to table is to take scientific 
and  standardized  quality  management  measures  under 
the  process  of  choosing,  protecting  and  purifying  the 
farm produce, using the inputs such as, feed, veterinary 
drugs,  chemical  fertilizer,  agricultural  machinery  etc., 
application 
regulations, 
controlling  the  process  and  circulation,  what  's  more, 
the concept is also extended to the consuming process, 
holding  the  highest  object  of  satisfying  the  ultimate 
supervision  of 
product  consumer.  The  quality 
agricultural  products  which

processes, worked out badly due to the imperfection in

CONSTRUCTION OF THE MODERN 

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS LOGISTICS 
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT MODE  

BASED ON IOT 

is 

auto 

 
Basic  features  of  IOT:  Based  on  Computer  Internet, 
Internet  of  Things  making  use  of  Radio  Frequency 
Identification  and  wireless  data  communication 
technique,  constructs  a  network 
that  cover  with 
everything  on  the  earth.  In  which  things  can  hold 
each  other  without  manual 
communion  with 
intervention.  The 
essence 
recognizing 
merchandise  and  realizing  interlink  and  wide  share  of 
information by using RFID. In the conception of IOT, 
normative and interoperability information are placed in 
RFIT  tag  and  are  acquired  automatically  to  the  centre 
information  system  though  open  computer  Internet, 
thereby exchanging and sharing the information though 
the  use  of  open  computer  Internet  and  implementing 
transparent management. 
 
Mode  construction:  Centered  on  the  core  enterprise, 
the supply chain is a function nets chain structure that 
integrates 
distributors, 
retailers  and 
the  final  customers.  By  controlling 
information flow, logistics and capital flow, the supply 
chain starts from purchasing raw materials then makes 
intermediate products and final products and eventually 
sends product to target consumer via the sales Internet. 
Generally, the supply chain consists of four processes, 
materials 
circulation, 
information  circulation  and  cash  flow,  which  have 
different  functions  and  different  circulation  directions. 
To  realize  the  minimum  unit  cost  for  agricultural 
 

suppliers,  manufacturers, 

commercial 

circulation, 

products from production to consumption and guarantee 
the  products  quality,  it  is  required  that  all  the  nodal 
enterprises in the supply chain of agricultural products 
must  operate  synchronously and  coordinately.  Only  in 
this way can all the enterprises be benefited. Therefore, 
the  management  of  supply  chain  is  based  on  smooth 
information  flow,  Supported  by  IOT  and  information 
technology, the logistics of modern logistics technology 
are  important  components  of  modern  logistics  system, 
through the IOT platform and information technology, 
farmers, suppliers, wholesaler, retailers and consumers 
are  blinded  together.  The  real-time  tracking,  effective 
control and whole-process management of each link in 
agricultural  products' 
logistics  are  realized,  with 
resources and information shared. 

traditional 

logistics  management  mode 

There  is  no  doubt  that  "IOT"  represents  the 
direction  of  information  revolution  in  the  future,  To 
improve  the  competitive  ability  of  the  agricultural 
products in our country, build famous brands, monitor 
their  quality  as  well  as  security  and  increase  farmers' 
income, our country should carry forward a reform of 
the 
for 
agricultural  products  in  advance  and  build  a  modern 
logistics supply chain management mode based on IOT. 
A SCOR mode for modern agricultural products based 
on IOT is presented in Fig. 2. 
 
Advantages of the mode:  
The  transformation  from  passive  production  to 
active  production  of  agricultural  products:  The 
initiative is  mainly  manifested in two aspects. On one 
side,  the  raw  materials,  technologies  and  equipments 
that  are  needed  in  the  production  of  agricultural 
products can be timely and scientifically  settled  in  the

the  production  mode  of 

"supply chain management and service center". On the 
other  side,  the  output  of  agricultural  products  can  be 
reasonably controlled according to previous sales data. 
Thus, 
"manufacturing 
according  to  sale"  for  agricultural  products  can  be 
realized. 
 
Logistics  distribution  can  be  accomplished  by  the 
third  party 
logistics 
company:  With  the  step-by-step  socialization  and 
professionalization of modern logistics system, the third 
party  logistics  distribution  center  which  is  responsible 
for  the  logistics  distribution  of  agricultural  products 
supply  chain has  become  the  principal  method for  the 
logistics  distribution  for  modern  agricultural  products. 
Through  advanced  management  and  technology,  the 
logistics  distribution  center  makes  full  use  of  the 
information  provided  by  modern  agricultural  products 
supply  chain  management  and  services  center,  which 
makes  the  whole  process  of  modern  agricultural 
products  circulation  efficient,  coordinate  and  orderly. 
Thus,  the  damage  and  cost  are  cut  down  and  the 
optimum economic and social benefits are gained. 
 
Lowering  the  dealing  cost  that  occurs  in  the 
circulation  process  of  agricultural  products: 
Through  coordinating  the  information  flow  of  the 
supply chain for agricultural products, the dealing cost 
that  occurs  in  the  circulation  process  of  agricultural 
products  is  cut  down.  By  sharing  information,  each 
nodal  enterprise  in  the  supply  chain  for  agricultural 
products  collaboratively 
the  whole 
circulation  process  and  organizes  logistics  reasonably. 
Through  the  one-step  check,  damage  caused  by  long 
logistics  process  of  agricultural  products  is  lowered, 
Besides, the professional third party logistics with rapid 
speed can help to curtail the distance travelled, shorten 
the production period of agricultural products, improve 
dealing efficiency and cut down logistic cost.  
 
Realizing 
the  whole-process  management  of 
agricultural  products'  quality:  Modern  agricultural 
products  are  marked  by  RFID  labels  with  unique  ID 
number from the first process of production, during the 
production  process,  all  the  correlating  information  is 
gathered  and 
related 
frequency  chip  management  system  is  applied  to  deal 
with the information of producing agricultural products. 
Moreover,  by  making  records  in  the  whole  growth 
process of individual agricultural product or that in the 
same  lot,  we  can  obtain  the  seeds  needed  in  the 
production of agricultural products, information such as 
the raw materials demanded in growth process, state of 
illness and treating. Besides, the statistical analysis and 
management  can  be  conducted.  Meanwhile,  in  the 
process  of  transportation,  manufacturing,  storing  and

quality a reality. 
 

THE APPLICATION OF SCOR MODEL IN PIG 

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

lower  bullwhip  effect, 

 
Lower cost, higher efficiency: Based on SCOR model, 
the  pig  supply  chain  management  renders  higher 
transparency to all links. Pig and its elaborated products 
can be traced in real time in the whole supply chain. As 
reader-writers  are  installed  in  breeding  companies, 
slaughterhouses,  distribution  centre  and  store  shelves, 
the  flow  of  meat  products  in  the  whole  supply  chain-
from  breeding  to  ultimate  consumers  can  be  recorded 
automatically.  Hence, 
less 
inventory cost as well as labor cost for logistics centres 
or  distribution  centres,  higher  utilization  rate  of 
inventory,  more  inventory  turnover.  Informatization, 
automation and intellectualization are achieved.  
 
Information  sharing,  supply  and  demand  balance: 
With the Information sharing mechanism, SCOR model 
enables  all  sectors of pork  supply  chain  to  check  data 
read by RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) system. 
When  there  are  inadequate  or  excessive  products, 
suppliers  can  get  demand  Information  from  SCOR 
model,  then  adjust  output  and  deliver  goods  on  time, 
making  the  whole  supply  chain  respond  in  time  and 
avoid unnecessary loss. As the supply chain is able to 
perceive  and 
the  changing 
consumption  direction,  pork  processors  can  timely 
improve  or  adjust  production,  distributor  and  retailers 
can  reduce  the  amount  of  stock or  stop  stocking,  thus 
balancing  supply  and  demand,  avoiding  inventory 
backlog and maximizing profits.  
 
Accurate  and  effective  control  of  supply  chain: 
Because of errors in bar code scanning while checking 
inventory  of  goods  or  artificial  errors  in  identifying 
damaged  bar  codes,  there  are  errors  in  about  30%  of 
detailed  lists  of  logistics  management,  leading  to 
disrupted  the  flow  if  information  and  logistics  and 
ultimate  damage  of  the  interests  of  merchants  and 
consumers.  SCOR  mode  can  improve  accuracy  and 
speed of information identification and reduce errors in 
distribution,  storage  and  transportation  of  products. 
Monitoring  is  conducted  in  the  whole  process  from 
breeding,  pigs  available  for  slaughter,  processed 
products  referrals,  in  and  out  of  the  distributor’s 
warehouse to sales of retailers. Distributors can monitor 
and  control  stock  and  keep  reasonable  stock  levels 
while retailers are able to monitor sales allowance and 
replenish goods.

Abstract: Modern agriculture features industrialization, marketized industrial structure, intensive production pattern 
and high digitization; farm produce logistics are characterized by wide range, large quantity, relative independence, 
consumable as well as value-added processing. In this study, in view of the features of modern agriculture and farm 
produce logistics, a SCOR model (Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model) of agricultural products based on the 
Internet of things has been put forward through the improvement of the logistics model of traditional agricultural 
products. The advantages of this model have also been analyzed.

INTRODUCTION 

 

For  food  and  agricultural  products,  the  whole 
procedure  from  production  to  consumption  involves 
production, processing, packing, transportation, storage, 
shelf  display  and  consumption.  Each  link  is  likely  to 
bring unsafe factors, which mainly include: the inputs of 
poisonous  and  harmful  material  residues  during  the 
planting  and  breeding  processes; 
the  effects  of 
environmental  pollutants  to  food  hygiene,  as  pesticide, 
fertilizer  and  other  environmental  pollutants  can  enter 
human  body  through  the  food  chain  and  then  bring 
damage  to  health;  pollution  during  the  processing, 
transportation, 
consumers’ 
requirements  for  the  quality  and  safety  of  food  and 
agricultural products have been improved continuously, 
it is urgent for us to do the whole monitoring for food 
and agricultural products supply chain. The tracking and 
traceability of the product also become more important

Because  the  supply  chain  of  food  and  agricultural 
production  and  distribution  of  space  are  of  wide  area, 
even flow, the traditional wired sensor technology can't 
meet the needs of the whole monitoring application. In 
recent  years,  along  with  the  development  of  Micro 
Electromechanical 
wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics.  The  IOT 
(Internet of Things) research has made great progress. It 
has developed a lot of micro sensor nodes with low cost, 
low  power  consumption,  awareness,  computing  and 
communication  capabilities,  as  well  as  the  relatively 
mature RFID chips, encapsulation, reading and writing 
equipment design, manufacturing and system integration

things technology in the food and agricultural products 
production,  processing,  logistics,  safety  supervision 
become  highlights  in  many  colleges  and  universities,

the  differences 

enterprises and research institutions at home and abroad 
in  the  recent  years.  As  to  main  research  at  home  and 
abroad, such as Amador installs RFID with temperature 
sensor  in  pineapple  corrugated  carton  and  plastic 
turnover  box  (Some  with  sensor  probe  inserted  in  the 
pulp), through the experiment from Costa Rica to United 
States  in  the  long-distance  transportation  we  get  the 
pineapple surface temperature and the pulp temperature 
changes  and 
the  measurement 
accuracy  of  recording  method  compared  with  the 
technology  and  the  traditional  method  (Amador  et  al., 
2009).  Abad  with  others  use  RFID  sensor  with 
temperature,  humidity  and  light  sensor  to  study  the 
technique  of  Internet  of  things’  application  in  an 
intercontinental  transportation  of  the  fresh  fish  from 
South  Africa  to  Europe,  air-land  coordinated  transport 
over a period of 3 days (Abad et al., 2009). Hayes and 
other researchers set temperature sensors of WSN in two 
fishing  boats  and  use  SMS  (text  message)  through  the 
GSM  network  to  transmit  real-time  data  to  Internet 
server  and  record  it,  solving  the  problems  of  past 
method which can only realized single ship monitoring 
system. The technology can be extended to more fishing 
boats’ wide-area monitoring (Hayes et al., 2005). Wang 
xiaodong  and  other  experts  designed 
real-time 
monitoring system based on GPRS technology which is 
suitable  for  the  food  cold  chain  transporter.  The 
temperature monitoring data can be sent to the server of 
the control center (Wang et al., 2009). Shan and others 
studied  application  feasibility  of  Bluetooth,  Zigbee, 
artificial  intelligence,  neural  network  and  fuzzy  logic 
technology  in  the  cold  chain  transportation  and  put 
forward  the  future  application  of  the  Internet  of  things 
technology  in  cold  chain  transport  track  and  the 
technical  scheme  for  automatic  decision-making  ideas 
(Shan et al., 2004). Ruiz-Garcia and others studied the 
application of WSN in fruit multi-transportation and the

effectiveness  of  the  sensor  nodes  in  low  temperature 
environment  in  Zigbee  network  is  verified.  He  also 
proposed that we can quickly determine moisture loss in 
product  through  monitoring  the  change  of  moisture 
content  in  air  environment  (Ruiz-Garcia  et  al.,  2008). 
Gras  found  that  if  we  install  passive  RFID  with  a 
temperature sensor in the frozen food packaging, we can 
quickly acquire and record the actual temperature of the 
item,  to  speed  up  the  logistics  (Gras,  2006).  Many 
research results show that the Internet of things is more 
and more widely used in food circulation. 

the  greater  part, 

Since  traditional  agriculture  in  our  country  now 
makes  up 
the  development  of 
agricultural products logistics is still backward and fails 
to  form  standard  organization  and  management.  The 
transport  management,  which  lacks  of  wholeness  and 
coordination,  directly  leads  to  hindered  circulation  of 
agricultural products and the increase of cost (Yue and 
Huang,  2004).  The  agriculture  operations  is  mainly 
based  upon 
the  correlating 
agricultural products circulating system characterized as 
"small  scale  and  big  group"  finds  it  more  and  more 
difficult  to  meet  the  demands  of  modern  agricultural 
products  logistics  and  agricultural  industrialization. 
Therefore,  stepping  up  the  development  of  modern 
agriculture  has  become  the  important  strategy  towards 
the building of agricultural power.

ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF  
MODERN AGRICULTURE 

 
Marketization  of  agricultural  industrial  structure: 
Geared  by  the  market,  the  modern  agriculture  meet 
people's  basic  consuming  demands  by  adjusting  the 
agricultural  industry  structure.  The  marketization  of 
agriculture industry is to pick up the leading product and 
develop  market  agriculture  that  integrates  production 
and marketing, as well as a highly open export-oriented 
agriculture, in accordance with the supply and demand 
situation  of  farm  produce  market  and  combining  with 
different  economic  conditions  and  natural  resources  of 
agriculture. 
 
Intension of the agriculture production mode: As one 
of the essential features of modern agriculture, intensive 
production  transformed  the  extensive  production  form 
into mechanized, improved, specialized and large scaled

The characteristics of agricultural products logistics: 
Agricultural products logistics is a physical economical 
activity,  which  aims  to  satisfy  consumers  and  realize 
profit,  by 
the  material  object  or 
information  from  producers  to  customers.  It  contains 
several 
transportation, 
storage, load and unload, packing, distribution, circulate 
process, retail and information activities etc. During this 
process, the organized goal and increment are achieved. 
The  features  of  our  agricultural  products  is  mainly 
focused on the following aspects: 
 
•  Large scale and wide variety of product logistics 
•  Relative  independence  of  agricultural  products 
logistics  operating.  The  production  of 
farm 
produce,  circulation  and  processing,  packing 
methods,  storage  condition,  as  well  as

agricultural products logistics 

 
Operation  mode  of  agricultural  products  logistics: 
The  present  agricultural  products  logistics  in  our 
country  is  still  on  the  initial  stage,  the  circulation 
system  is  backward,  As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  The  broad

Problems  of  agricultural  products  logistics:  The 
existing  problems  of  agricultural  products  logistics  in 
our country now are mainly as follows. 
 
Disconnection between production and demand: The 
production  of  agricultural  products,  for  the  most  part, 
fail to get involved in agricultural products logistics and 
are  forced  to  obey  the  middlemen  or  distributors, 
without  accurate  data  of  marketing  prospect  and 
demands, the initiative of farm is mainly based on the 
price once have, especially the previous year, such kind 
of  production  of  agricultural  products  often  cannot 
reflect  the  true  demands  of  market,  which  cause  the 
blindness of farmer production. 
 
Excessive  intermediate  link:  As  shown  in  above 
figure,  it  is  find  to  need  several  intermediate  link, 
before it reaches the consumers, overmuch intermediate 
link  and  laggard  trade  mode  have  lowered  the  trade 
efficiency and increase the wasting of intermediate link, 
the unit price of agricultural products and the cost. 
 
Low  informationization:  Most  enterprises  in  our 
country  now  did  not  realize  the  significance  of 
informationization  to  their  self  development  and  the 
units  on  agricultural  products  supply  chain  have  no 
information 
information 
communication,  which  lead  to  a  lack  of  necessary 
understanding between enterprises on the farm produce 
supply  chain  and  the  information  of  downriver  and 
upriver  cannot  reach  each  other  smoothly.  As  to  the 
farmers,  the  uncertainty  of  demand  information  and 
uncontrollable intendancy cause wide price fluctuation 
in  the  terminal  market,  which  is  detrimental  to  the 
equilibrium  of  supply  and  demand  in  agricultural 
products.  For  the  consumer,  the  opacity  of  supply 
information 
thorough 
understanding to the product quality. It is for the same 

reason,  that  the  government  suffers  from  inadequate 
supervisor and exorbitant cost. 
 
Miniature  logistics:  Although  the  subject  of  logistics 
are  pluralistic  and  large  scalar,  it  is  small  in  size  and 
week  in  competition.  Though  the  reform  and  open  of 
several  years,  there  are  emerged  a  lot  of  subjects  of 
agricultural  products  logistics,  in  addition  to  the 
traditional  logistics  such  as,  state  business  enterprise, 
suppliers and so on. There are also the great family of 
rural production and operation, the leading corporation 
of agriculture industrialization, professional association 
and professional logistic company, etc., from which we 
can  see  the  subject  of  logistics  are  develop  in  the 
direction  of  diversification. The  logistic  corporation  is 
in large quantities and develop in high speed, however; 
numerous participant individuals and organizations are 
small  scale,  discrete,  low-organizational,  lacking  of 
competition.  So  it  is  difficult  to  deal  with  the  impact 
from  the  market  and  large  logistic  corporation  and  let 
alone compete with large logistic MNC with advanced 
management and operation method. 
 
Product  quality  lacking  of  whole  process  control: 
The 
fully 
management from farm land to table is to take scientific 
and  standardized  quality  management  measures  under 
the  process  of  choosing,  protecting  and  purifying  the 
farm produce, using the inputs such as, feed, veterinary 
drugs,  chemical  fertilizer,  agricultural  machinery  etc.,

the concept is also extended to the consuming process,

product  consumer.  The  quality

CONSTRUCTION OF THE MODERN 

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS LOGISTICS 
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT MODE  

BASED ON IOT 

is 

auto 

 
Basic  features  of  IOT:  Based  on  Computer  Internet, 
Internet  of  Things  making  use  of  Radio  Frequency 
Identification  and  wireless  data  communication 
technique,  constructs  a  network 
that  cover  with 
everything  on  the  earth.  In  which  things  can  hold 
each  other  without  manual 
communion  with 
intervention.  The 
essence 
recognizing 
merchandise  and  realizing  interlink  and  wide  share  of 
information by using RFID. In the conception of IOT, 
normative and interoperability information are placed in 
RFIT  tag  and  are  acquired  automatically  to  the  centre 
information  system  though  open  computer  Internet, 
thereby exchanging and sharing the information though 
the  use  of  open  computer  Internet  and  implementing 
transparent management. 
 
Mode  construction:  Centered  on  the  core  enterprise, 
the supply chain is a function nets chain structure that 
integrates 
distributors, 
retailers  and 
the  final  customers.  By  controlling 
information flow, logistics and capital flow, the supply 
chain starts from purchasing raw materials then makes 
intermediate products and final products and eventually 
sends product to target consumer via the sales Internet. 
Generally, the supply chain consists of four processes, 
materials 
circulation, 
information  circulation  and  cash  flow,  which  have 
different  functions  and  different  circulation  directions. 
To  realize  the  minimum  unit  cost  for  agricultural 
 

suppliers,  manufacturers, 

commercial 

circulation, 

products from production to consumption and guarantee 
the  products  quality,  it  is  required  that  all  the  nodal 
enterprises in the supply chain of agricultural products 
must  operate  synchronously and  coordinately.  Only  in 
this way can all the enterprises be benefited. Therefore, 
the  management  of  supply  chain  is  based  on  smooth 
information  flow,  Supported  by  IOT  and  information 
technology, the logistics of modern logistics technology 
are  important  components  of  modern  logistics  system, 
through the IOT platform and information technology, 
farmers, suppliers, wholesaler, retailers and consumers 
are  blinded  together.  The  real-time  tracking,  effective 
control and whole-process management of each link in 
agricultural  products' 
logistics  are  realized,  with 
resources and information shared. 

traditional 

logistics  management  mode 

There  is  no  doubt  that  "IOT"  represents  the 
direction  of  information  revolution  in  the  future,  To 
improve  the  competitive  ability  of  the  agricultural 
products in our country, build famous brands, monitor 
their  quality  as  well  as  security  and  increase  farmers' 
income, our country should carry forward a reform of 
the 
for 
agricultural  products  in  advance  and  build  a  modern 
logistics supply chain management mode based on IOT. 
A SCOR mode for modern agricultural products based 
on IOT is presented in Fig. 2. 
 
Advantages of the mode:  
The  transformation  from  passive  production  to 
active  production  of  agricultural  products:  The 
initiative is  mainly  manifested in two aspects. On one 
side,  the  raw  materials,  technologies  and  equipments 
that  are  needed  in  the  production  of  agricultural 
products can be timely and scientifically  settled  in  the

"supply chain management and service center". On the 
other  side,  the  output  of  agricultural  products  can  be 
reasonably controlled according to previous sales data. 
Thus, 
"manufacturing 
according  to  sale"  for  agricultural  products  can  be 
realized. 
 
Logistics  distribution  can  be  accomplished  by  the 
third  party 
logistics 
company:  With  the  step-by-step  socialization  and 
professionalization of modern logistics system, the third 
party  logistics  distribution  center  which  is  responsible 
for  the  logistics  distribution  of  agricultural  products 
supply  chain has  become  the  principal  method for  the 
logistics  distribution  for  modern  agricultural  products. 
Through  advanced  management  and  technology,  the 
logistics  distribution  center  makes  full  use  of  the 
information  provided  by  modern  agricultural  products 
supply  chain  management  and  services  center,  which 
makes  the  whole  process  of  modern  agricultural 
products  circulation  efficient,  coordinate  and  orderly. 
Thus,  the  damage  and  cost  are  cut  down  and  the 
optimum economic and social benefits are gained. 
 
Lowering  the  dealing  cost  that  occurs  in  the 
circulation  process  of  agricultural  products: 
Through  coordinating  the  information  flow  of  the 
supply chain for agricultural products, the dealing cost 
that  occurs  in  the  circulation  process  of  agricultural 
products  is  cut  down.  By  sharing  information,  each 
nodal  enterprise  in  the  supply  chain  for  agricultural 
products  collaboratively 
the  whole 
circulation  process  and  organizes  logistics  reasonably. 
Through  the  one-step  check,  damage  caused  by  long 
logistics  process  of  agricultural  products  is  lowered, 
Besides, the professional third party logistics with rapid 
speed can help to curtail the distance travelled, shorten 
the production period of agricultural products, improve 
dealing efficiency and cut down logistic cost.  
 
Realizing 
the  whole-process  management  of 
agricultural  products'  quality:  Modern  agricultural 
products  are  marked  by  RFID  labels  with  unique  ID 
number from the first process of production, during the 
production  process,  all  the  correlating  information  is 
gathered  and 
related 
frequency  chip  management  system  is  applied  to  deal 
with the information of producing agricultural products. 
Moreover,  by  making  records  in  the  whole  growth 
process of individual agricultural product or that in the 
same  lot,  we  can  obtain  the  seeds  needed  in  the 
production of agricultural products, information such as 
the raw materials demanded in growth process, state of 
illness and treating. Besides, the statistical analysis and 
management  can  be  conducted.  Meanwhile,  in  the 
process  of  transportation,  manufacturing,  storing  and

management  can  be  realized  just  like  that  in  the 
producing  process  and  eventually  we  can  make  the 
whole  process  management  of  agricultural  products' 
quality a reality. 
 

THE APPLICATION OF SCOR MODEL IN PIG 

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

lower  bullwhip  effect, 

 
Lower cost, higher efficiency: Based on SCOR model, 
the  pig  supply  chain  management  renders  higher 
transparency to all links. Pig and its elaborated products 
can be traced in real time in the whole supply chain. As 
reader-writers  are  installed  in  breeding  companies, 
slaughterhouses,  distribution  centre  and  store  shelves, 
the  flow  of  meat  products  in  the  whole  supply  chain-
from  breeding  to  ultimate  consumers  can  be  recorded 
automatically.  Hence, 
less 
inventory cost as well as labor cost for logistics centres 
or  distribution  centres,  higher  utilization  rate  of 
inventory,  more  inventory  turnover.  Informatization, 
automation and intellectualization are achieved.  
 
Information  sharing,  supply  and  demand  balance: 
With the Information sharing mechanism, SCOR model 
enables  all  sectors of pork  supply  chain  to  check  data 
read by RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) system. 
When  there  are  inadequate  or  excessive  products, 
suppliers  can  get  demand  Information  from  SCOR 
model,  then  adjust  output  and  deliver  goods  on  time, 
making  the  whole  supply  chain  respond  in  time  and 
avoid unnecessary loss. As the supply chain is able to 
perceive  and 
the  changing 
consumption  direction,  pork  processors  can  timely 
improve  or  adjust  production,  distributor  and  retailers 
can  reduce  the  amount  of  stock or  stop  stocking,  thus 
balancing  supply  and  demand,  avoiding  inventory 
backlog and maximizing profits.  
 
Accurate  and  effective  control  of  supply  chain: 
Because of errors in bar code scanning while checking 
inventory  of  goods  or  artificial  errors  in  identifying 
damaged  bar  codes,  there  are  errors  in  about  30%  of 
detailed  lists  of  logistics  management,  leading  to 
disrupted  the  flow  if  information  and  logistics  and 
ultimate  damage  of  the  interests  of  merchants  and 
consumers.  SCOR  mode  can  improve  accuracy  and 
speed of information identification and reduce errors in 
distribution,  storage  and  transportation  of  products. 
Monitoring  is  conducted  in  the  whole  process  from 
breeding,  pigs  available  for  slaughter,  processed 
products  referrals,  in  and  out  of  the  distributor’s 
warehouse to sales of retailers. Distributors can monitor 
and  control  stock  and  keep  reasonable  stock  levels 
while retailers are able to monitor sales allowance and 
replenish goods.

production operators and give punishment to enterprises 
with  unsafe  factors,  so  as  to  improve  the  quality  and 
safety level of production operators. 
 
Strengthening  management  of  pig  safety  standard: 
In  recent  years,  all  kinds  of  pig  safety  problems  are 
repeatedly  appeared  both  at  home  and  abroad,  these 
problems  make  consumers  lose  confidence  in  pig 
safety. To this end, we should establish strict, advanced, 
more  scientific  system  of  quality  standards.  On  this 
issue,  we  can  draw  lessons  from  some  western 
developed countries on quality standards and pig safety 
control system. Such as EU countries, the EU 's quality 
standards  and  pig  safety  control  systems  have  several 
kinds,  some  have  international  standard  (such  as  ISO 
9000  series,  namely,  the  international  organization  for 
standardization 
assurance 
standards),  the  European  Union  standard  (such  as 
HACCP, namely pig hazard analysis and critical point 
control), the national standard (such as the BRC, British 
retailers  organized  technical  standards),  the  industry 
standard  (such  as  EUR/GAP,  namely  the  European 
retailers  coalition/high  quality  agricultural  standards). 
These four categories have different applicable objects 
and scope without conflicts. Among them, the HACCP 
system  is  considered  as  the  most  effective  way  to 
guarantee pig safety. 
 
Strengthening emergency management and building 
fast  recovery  path  for  harmful  pig:  For  major  pig 
safety accidents, we shall establish and perfect efficient 
rescue 
to 
standardize  and  guide  the  emergency  response  work 
and  minimize  the  harm  brought  by  accident,  protect 
public health and life security, maintain social stability. 
Improve  the  harmful  pig  rapidly  recycling  channel. 
Once harmful pig is found, the pig supply chain players 
should  be  initiative  to  take  responsibility,  to  recall 
harmful  pig  with  the  fastest  speed,  reducing  losses  to 
the minimum. They should never be like "San lu milk 
powder" incident. They have to set up the threshold of 
return.  Consumers  can  handle  the  return of  good  only 
with  invoice.  Those  people  who  haven’t  reserve 
invoices or throw about the harmful milk powder, may 
cause further environmental pollution.

Food  safety  and  recall  management:  Since  food 
safety  has  been  given  priority  by  government, 
enterprises  and  consumers,  a  traceable  information 
carrier  in food  supply  chain management  is  needed  to 
present the information about food safety. With the use 
of Internet of Things technology in pork supply chain, 
enterprises  of  breeding  and  processing  can  establish 
effective  recall  management  system  and  provide 
information about farms, processors and dates of pork 
and  its  processed  products  to  downriver  distributors, 
retailers  and  consumers.  Relevant  information  can  be 
found through SCOR model with code of RFID of each 
piece of pork product. Consumers, as buyers and eaters 
of  pork  products,  can  also  send  the  code  of  RFID  to 
notified  bodies  to  inquire  related  information,  which 
facilitates 
the  protection  of  personal  health  and 
consumer rights. 
 
To 
improve 
management: 
Building  platform  for  supply  chain  information  to 
ensure  pig  supply  quality  and  safety:  According  to 
the characteristics of different pig in the supply chain, 
we have to collect, transmit and deal with information 
in  the  course  of  breeding,  production  and  processing, 
transportation, storage, sales and other courses and then 
build  fresh  pig  and  pig  packaging  two  traceability 
information systems. On this basis, we can set up public 
information  platform  for  pig  quality  and  safety  of 
supply  chain  based  on  supply  chain 
integration, 
realizing traceability regulation for the whole process of 
food 
synchronous 
information 
flow,  workflow  among 
different  departments  and  information  sharing,  which 
improve  the  pertinence  and  effectiveness  of  the  pig 
safety  management work. Therefore, on one hand, the 
workload of human input related regulatory data can be 
decreased  and  the  traceability  of  product  can  be 
ensured, which can improve the quality of the product 
safety,  upgrade 
the 
enterprise  and  brand  value;  On 
the  other  hand, 
supervision efficiency can be enhanced and costs can be 
reduced, which can ensure the health and safety of food 
supply.  
 
Building  modern  pig  distribution  center:  Pig 
logistics  distribution  centre  is  one  of  the  important 
control  nodes  for  the  supply  chain  of  pig  quality  and 
safety. First, we can do centralized management for pig 
in  the  logistics  distribution  centre  and  realize  unified 
procurement,  reprocessing  and  distribution,  ensuring 
the  quality  and  hygiene  of  pig  and  safety  control  for 
pig;  Secondly,  we  can  construct  socialized  and 
specialized  pig  logistics  service  system  and  set  up 
professional  third  party  pig  logistics  enterprises  to 
prevent  pig  rot  and  pollution  in  the  process  of 
transportation;  Finally,  pig  logistics  distribution  centre 
can  put  forward  reward  mechanism  for  downstream

Abstract: Modern agriculture features industrialization, marketized industrial structure, intensive production pattern 
and high digitization; farm produce logistics are characterized by wide range, large quantity, relative independence, 
consumable as well as value-added processing. In this study, in view of the features of modern agriculture and farm 
produce logistics, a SCOR model (Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model) of agricultural products based on the 
Internet of things has been put forward through the improvement of the logistics model of traditional agricultural 
products. The advantages of this model have also been analyzed.

INTRODUCTION 

 

For  food  and  agricultural  products,  the  whole 
procedure  from  production  to  consumption  involves 
production, processing, packing, transportation, storage, 
shelf  display  and  consumption.  Each  link  is  likely  to 
bring unsafe factors, which mainly include: the inputs of 
poisonous  and  harmful  material  residues  during  the 
planting  and  breeding  processes; 
the  effects  of 
environmental  pollutants  to  food  hygiene,  as  pesticide, 
fertilizer  and  other  environmental  pollutants  can  enter 
human  body  through  the  food  chain  and  then  bring 
damage  to  health;  pollution  during  the  processing, 
transportation, 
consumers’ 
requirements  for  the  quality  and  safety  of  food  and 
agricultural products have been improved continuously, 
it is urgent for us to do the whole monitoring for food 
and agricultural products supply chain. The tracking and 
traceability of the product also become more important

Because  the  supply  chain  of  food  and  agricultural 
production  and  distribution  of  space  are  of  wide  area, 
even flow, the traditional wired sensor technology can't 
meet the needs of the whole monitoring application. In 
recent  years,  along  with  the  development  of  Micro 
Electromechanical 
wireless 
communications  and  digital  electronics.  The  IOT 
(Internet of Things) research has made great progress. It 
has developed a lot of micro sensor nodes with low cost, 
low  power  consumption,  awareness,  computing  and 
communication  capabilities,  as  well  as  the  relatively 
mature RFID chips, encapsulation, reading and writing

in  the  recent  years.  As  to  main  research  at  home  and 
abroad, such as Amador installs RFID with temperature 
sensor  in  pineapple  corrugated  carton  and  plastic 
turnover  box  (Some  with  sensor  probe  inserted  in  the

temperature,  humidity  and  light  sensor  to  study  the 
technique  of  Internet  of  things’  application  in  an 
intercontinental  transportation  of  the  fresh  fish  from 
South  Africa  to  Europe,  air-land  coordinated  transport

other researchers set temperature sensors of WSN in two 
fishing  boats  and  use  SMS  (text  message)  through  the 
GSM  network  to  transmit  real-time  data  to  Internet 
server  and  record  it,  solving  the  problems  of  past

proposed that we can quickly determine moisture loss in 
product  through  monitoring  the  change  of  moisture 
content  in  air  environment  (Ruiz-Garcia  et  al.,  2008). 
Gras  found  that  if  we  install  passive  RFID  with  a 
temperature sensor in the frozen food packaging, we can 
quickly acquire and record the actual temperature of the 
item,  to  speed  up  the  logistics  (Gras,  2006).  Many 
research results show that the Internet of things is more 
and more widely used in food circulation.

Since  traditional  agriculture  in  our  country  now 
makes  up 
the  development  of 
agricultural products logistics is still backward and fails 
to  form  standard  organization  and  management.  The 
transport  management,  which  lacks  of  wholeness  and 
coordination,  directly  leads  to  hindered  circulation  of 
agricultural products and the increase of cost (Yue and 
Huang,  2004).  The  agriculture  operations  is  mainly 
based  upon 
the  correlating 
agricultural products circulating system characterized as 
"small  scale  and  big  group"  finds  it  more  and  more 
difficult  to  meet  the  demands  of  modern  agricultural 
products  logistics  and  agricultural  industrialization. 
Therefore,  stepping  up  the  development  of  modern 
agriculture  has  become  the  important  strategy  towards 
the building of agricultural power.

ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF  
MODERN AGRICULTURE 

 
Marketization  of  agricultural  industrial  structure: 
Geared  by  the  market,  the  modern  agriculture  meet 
people's  basic  consuming  demands  by  adjusting  the 
agricultural  industry  structure.  The  marketization  of 
agriculture industry is to pick up the leading product and 
develop  market  agriculture  that  integrates  production 
and marketing, as well as a highly open export-oriented 
agriculture, in accordance with the supply and demand 
situation  of  farm  produce  market  and  combining  with 
different  economic  conditions  and  natural  resources  of 
agriculture. 
 
Intension of the agriculture production mode: As one 
of the essential features of modern agriculture, intensive 
production  transformed  the  extensive  production  form 
into mechanized, improved, specialized and large scaled 
production form. 
 
Industrialization  of  modern  agriculture:  Modern 
agriculture  is  a  kind  of  production  operation  system, 
which is integrated with planting, breeding, processing; 
production,  supply  and  sale;  export  and  import  trade; 
agriculture-industry-commerce; 
and 
education.  It 
is  market  oriented,  benefit  focused, 
centering on pillar industries, making rational allocation 
of  production  factors,  practicing  regional  distribution,

Modern  agriculture  should  be  high  digital:  Modern 
agriculture should be digitized. Digital agriculture refers 
to  a  intensive  agro-technique  supported  by  space  geo-
science  and  science  technology.  What  counts  is  to 
acquired the outputs of farm land crop and the different 
information of space-time environmental factors. Upon 
this  basis,  the  analysis  of  reasons  are  made  and  the 
relevant measures, which should be technically practical 
and  economically  effective,  are  adopted,  namely, 
"prescript farming".

The characteristics of agricultural products logistics: 
Agricultural products logistics is a physical economical 
activity,  which  aims  to  satisfy  consumers  and  realize 
profit,  by 
the  material  object  or 
information  from  producers  to  customers.  It  contains 
several 
transportation, 
storage, load and unload, packing, distribution, circulate 
process, retail and information activities etc. During this 
process, the organized goal and increment are achieved. 
The  features  of  our  agricultural  products  is  mainly 
focused on the following aspects: 
 
•  Large scale and wide variety of product logistics 
•  Relative  independence  of  agricultural  products

Operation  mode  of  agricultural  products  logistics: 
The  present  agricultural  products  logistics  in  our 
country  is  still  on  the  initial  stage,  the  circulation 
system  is  backward,  As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  The  broad

Problems  of  agricultural  products  logistics:  The 
existing  problems  of  agricultural  products  logistics  in 
our country now are mainly as follows. 
 
Disconnection between production and demand: The 
production  of  agricultural  products,  for  the  most  part, 
fail to get involved in agricultural products logistics and 
are  forced  to  obey  the  middlemen  or  distributors, 
without  accurate  data  of  marketing  prospect  and 
demands, the initiative of farm is mainly based on the 
price once have, especially the previous year, such kind 
of  production  of  agricultural  products  often  cannot 
reflect  the  true  demands  of  market,  which  cause  the 
blindness of farmer production. 
 
Excessive  intermediate  link:  As  shown  in  above 
figure,  it  is  find  to  need  several  intermediate  link, 
before it reaches the consumers, overmuch intermediate 
link  and  laggard  trade  mode  have  lowered  the  trade 
efficiency and increase the wasting of intermediate link, 
the unit price of agricultural products and the cost. 
 
Low  informationization:  Most  enterprises  in  our 
country  now  did  not  realize  the  significance  of 
informationization  to  their  self  development  and  the 
units  on  agricultural  products  supply  chain  have  no 
information 
information 
communication,  which  lead  to  a  lack  of  necessary 
understanding between enterprises on the farm produce 
supply  chain  and  the  information  of  downriver  and 
upriver  cannot  reach  each  other  smoothly.  As  to  the 
farmers,  the  uncertainty  of  demand  information  and 
uncontrollable intendancy cause wide price fluctuation 
in  the  terminal  market,  which  is  detrimental  to  the 
equilibrium  of  supply  and  demand  in  agricultural 
products.  For  the  consumer,  the  opacity  of  supply 
information 
thorough 
understanding to the product quality. It is for the same 

reason,  that  the  government  suffers  from  inadequate 
supervisor and exorbitant cost. 
 
Miniature  logistics:  Although  the  subject  of  logistics 
are  pluralistic  and  large  scalar,  it  is  small  in  size  and 
week  in  competition.  Though  the  reform  and  open  of 
several  years,  there  are  emerged  a  lot  of  subjects  of 
agricultural  products  logistics,  in  addition  to  the 
traditional  logistics  such  as,  state  business  enterprise, 
suppliers and so on. There are also the great family of 
rural production and operation, the leading corporation 
of agriculture industrialization, professional association 
and professional logistic company, etc., from which we 
can  see  the  subject  of  logistics  are  develop  in  the 
direction  of  diversification. The  logistic  corporation  is 
in large quantities and develop in high speed, however; 
numerous participant individuals and organizations are 
small  scale,  discrete,  low-organizational,  lacking  of 
competition.  So  it  is  difficult  to  deal  with  the  impact 
from  the  market  and  large  logistic  corporation  and  let 
alone compete with large logistic MNC with advanced 
management and operation method. 
 
Product  quality  lacking  of  whole  process  control: 
The 
fully 
management from farm land to table is to take scientific 
and  standardized  quality  management  measures  under 
the  process  of  choosing,  protecting  and  purifying  the 
farm produce, using the inputs such as, feed, veterinary 
drugs,  chemical  fertilizer,  agricultural  machinery  etc.,

controlling  the  process  and  circulation,  what  's  more, 
the concept is also extended to the consuming process, 
holding  the  highest  object  of  satisfying  the  ultimate 
supervision  of 
product  consumer.  The  quality

CONSTRUCTION OF THE MODERN 

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS LOGISTICS 
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT MODE  

BASED ON IOT 

is 

auto 

 
Basic  features  of  IOT:  Based  on  Computer  Internet, 
Internet  of  Things  making  use  of  Radio  Frequency 
Identification  and  wireless  data  communication 
technique,  constructs  a  network 
that  cover  with 
everything  on  the  earth.  In  which  things  can  hold 
each  other  without  manual 
communion  with 
intervention.  The 
essence 
recognizing 
merchandise  and  realizing  interlink  and  wide  share  of 
information by using RFID. In the conception of IOT, 
normative and interoperability information are placed in 
RFIT  tag  and  are  acquired  automatically  to  the  centre 
information  system  though  open  computer  Internet, 
thereby exchanging and sharing the information though 
the  use  of  open  computer  Internet  and  implementing 
transparent management. 
 
Mode  construction:  Centered  on  the  core  enterprise, 
the supply chain is a function nets chain structure that 
integrates 
distributors, 
retailers  and 
the  final  customers.  By  controlling 
information flow, logistics and capital flow, the supply 
chain starts from purchasing raw materials then makes 
intermediate products and final products and eventually 
sends product to target consumer via the sales Internet. 
Generally, the supply chain consists of four processes, 
materials 
circulation, 
information  circulation  and  cash  flow,  which  have 
different  functions  and  different  circulation  directions. 
To  realize  the  minimum  unit  cost  for  agricultural 
 

suppliers,  manufacturers, 

commercial 

circulation, 

products from production to consumption and guarantee 
the  products  quality,  it  is  required  that  all  the  nodal 
enterprises in the supply chain of agricultural products 
must  operate  synchronously and  coordinately.  Only  in 
this way can all the enterprises be benefited. Therefore, 
the  management  of  supply  chain  is  based  on  smooth 
information  flow,  Supported  by  IOT  and  information 
technology, the logistics of modern logistics technology 
are  important  components  of  modern  logistics  system, 
through the IOT platform and information technology, 
farmers, suppliers, wholesaler, retailers and consumers 
are  blinded  together.  The  real-time  tracking,  effective 
control and whole-process management of each link in 
agricultural  products' 
logistics  are  realized,  with 
resources and information shared. 

traditional 

logistics  management  mode 

There  is  no  doubt  that  "IOT"  represents  the 
direction  of  information  revolution  in  the  future,  To 
improve  the  competitive  ability  of  the  agricultural 
products in our country, build famous brands, monitor 
their  quality  as  well  as  security  and  increase  farmers' 
income, our country should carry forward a reform of 
the 
for 
agricultural  products  in  advance  and  build  a  modern 
logistics supply chain management mode based on IOT. 
A SCOR mode for modern agricultural products based 
on IOT is presented in Fig. 2. 
 
Advantages of the mode:  
The  transformation  from  passive  production  to 
active  production  of  agricultural  products:  The 
initiative is  mainly  manifested in two aspects. On one 
side,  the  raw  materials,  technologies  and  equipments 
that  are  needed  in  the  production  of  agricultural 
products can be timely and scientifically  settled  in  the

"supply chain management and service center". On the 
other  side,  the  output  of  agricultural  products  can  be 
reasonably controlled according to previous sales data. 
Thus, 
"manufacturing 
according  to  sale"  for  agricultural  products  can  be 
realized. 
 
Logistics  distribution  can  be  accomplished  by  the 
third  party 
logistics 
company:  With  the  step-by-step  socialization  and 
professionalization of modern logistics system, the third 
party  logistics  distribution  center  which  is  responsible 
for  the  logistics  distribution  of  agricultural  products 
supply  chain has  become  the  principal  method for  the 
logistics  distribution  for  modern  agricultural  products. 
Through  advanced  management  and  technology,  the 
logistics  distribution  center  makes  full  use  of  the 
information  provided  by  modern  agricultural  products 
supply  chain  management  and  services  center,  which 
makes  the  whole  process  of  modern  agricultural 
products  circulation  efficient,  coordinate  and  orderly. 
Thus,  the  damage  and  cost  are  cut  down  and  the 
optimum economic and social benefits are gained. 
 
Lowering  the  dealing  cost  that  occurs  in  the 
circulation  process  of  agricultural  products: 
Through  coordinating  the  information  flow  of  the 
supply chain for agricultural products, the dealing cost 
that  occurs  in  the  circulation  process  of  agricultural 
products  is  cut  down.  By  sharing  information,  each 
nodal  enterprise  in  the  supply  chain  for  agricultural 
products  collaboratively 
the  whole 
circulation  process  and  organizes  logistics  reasonably. 
Through  the  one-step  check,  damage  caused  by  long 
logistics  process  of  agricultural  products  is  lowered, 
Besides, the professional third party logistics with rapid 
speed can help to curtail the distance travelled, shorten 
the production period of agricultural products, improve 
dealing efficiency and cut down logistic cost.  
 
Realizing 
the  whole-process  management  of 
agricultural  products'  quality:  Modern  agricultural 
products  are  marked  by  RFID  labels  with  unique  ID 
number from the first process of production, during the 
production  process,  all  the  correlating  information  is 
gathered  and 
related 
frequency  chip  management  system  is  applied  to  deal 
with the information of producing agricultural products. 
Moreover,  by  making  records  in  the  whole  growth 
process of individual agricultural product or that in the 
same  lot,  we  can  obtain  the  seeds  needed  in  the 
production of agricultural products, information such as 
the raw materials demanded in growth process, state of 
illness and treating. Besides, the statistical analysis and 
management  can  be  conducted.  Meanwhile,  in  the 
process  of  transportation,  manufacturing,  storing  and

management  can  be  realized  just  like  that  in  the 
producing  process  and  eventually  we  can  make  the 
whole  process  management  of  agricultural  products' 
quality a reality. 
 

THE APPLICATION OF SCOR MODEL IN PIG 

SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT 

lower  bullwhip  effect, 

 
Lower cost, higher efficiency: Based on SCOR model, 
the  pig  supply  chain  management  renders  higher 
transparency to all links. Pig and its elaborated products 
can be traced in real time in the whole supply chain. As 
reader-writers  are  installed  in  breeding  companies, 
slaughterhouses,  distribution  centre  and  store  shelves, 
the  flow  of  meat  products  in  the  whole  supply  chain-
from  breeding  to  ultimate  consumers  can  be  recorded 
automatically.  Hence, 
less 
inventory cost as well as labor cost for logistics centres 
or  distribution  centres,  higher  utilization  rate  of 
inventory,  more  inventory  turnover.  Informatization, 
automation and intellectualization are achieved.  
 
Information  sharing,  supply  and  demand  balance: 
With the Information sharing mechanism, SCOR model 
enables  all  sectors of pork  supply  chain  to  check  data 
read by RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) system. 
When  there  are  inadequate  or  excessive  products, 
suppliers  can  get  demand  Information  from  SCOR 
model,  then  adjust  output  and  deliver  goods  on  time, 
making  the  whole  supply  chain  respond  in  time  and 
avoid unnecessary loss. As the supply chain is able to 
perceive  and 
the  changing 
consumption  direction,  pork  processors  can  timely 
improve  or  adjust  production,  distributor  and  retailers 
can  reduce  the  amount  of  stock or  stop  stocking,  thus 
balancing  supply  and  demand,  avoiding  inventory 
backlog and maximizing profits.  
 
Accurate  and  effective  control  of  supply  chain: 
Because of errors in bar code scanning while checking 
inventory  of  goods  or  artificial  errors  in  identifying 
damaged  bar  codes,  there  are  errors  in  about  30%  of 
detailed  lists  of  logistics  management,  leading  to 
disrupted  the  flow  if  information  and  logistics  and 
ultimate  damage  of  the  interests  of  merchants  and 
consumers.  SCOR  mode  can  improve  accuracy  and 
speed of information identification and reduce errors in 
distribution,  storage  and  transportation  of  products. 
Monitoring  is  conducted  in  the  whole  process  from 
breeding,  pigs  available  for  slaughter,  processed 
products  referrals,  in  and  out  of  the  distributor’s 
warehouse to sales of retailers. Distributors can monitor 
and  control  stock  and  keep  reasonable  stock  levels 
while retailers are able to monitor sales allowance and 
replenish goods.

production operators and give punishment to enterprises 
with  unsafe  factors,  so  as  to  improve  the  quality  and 
safety level of production operators. 
 
Strengthening  management  of  pig  safety  standard: 
In  recent  years,  all  kinds  of  pig  safety  problems  are 
repeatedly  appeared  both  at  home  and  abroad,  these 
problems  make  consumers  lose  confidence  in  pig 
safety. To this end, we should establish strict, advanced, 
more  scientific  system  of  quality  standards.  On  this 
issue,  we  can  draw  lessons  from  some  western 
developed countries on quality standards and pig safety 
control system. Such as EU countries, the EU 's quality 
standards  and  pig  safety  control  systems  have  several 
kinds,  some  have  international  standard  (such  as  ISO 
9000  series,  namely,  the  international  organization  for 
standardization 
assurance 
standards),  the  European  Union  standard  (such  as 
HACCP, namely pig hazard analysis and critical point 
control), the national standard (such as the BRC, British 
retailers  organized  technical  standards),  the  industry 
standard  (such  as  EUR/GAP,  namely  the  European 
retailers  coalition/high  quality  agricultural  standards). 
These four categories have different applicable objects 
and scope without conflicts. Among them, the HACCP 
system  is  considered  as  the  most  effective  way  to 
guarantee pig safety. 
 
Strengthening emergency management and building 
fast  recovery  path  for  harmful  pig:  For  major  pig 
safety accidents, we shall establish and perfect efficient 
rescue 
to 
standardize  and  guide  the  emergency  response  work 
and  minimize  the  harm  brought  by  accident,  protect 
public health and life security, maintain social stability. 
Improve  the  harmful  pig  rapidly  recycling  channel. 
Once harmful pig is found, the pig supply chain players 
should  be  initiative  to  take  responsibility,  to  recall 
harmful  pig  with  the  fastest  speed,  reducing  losses  to 
the minimum. They should never be like "San lu milk 
powder" incident. They have to set up the threshold of 
return.  Consumers  can  handle  the  return of  good  only 
with  invoice.  Those  people  who  haven’t  reserve 
invoices or throw about the harmful milk powder, may 
cause further environmental pollution.

Food  safety  and  recall  management:  Since  food 
safety  has  been  given  priority  by  government, 
enterprises  and  consumers,  a  traceable  information 
carrier  in food  supply  chain management  is  needed  to 
present the information about food safety. With the use 
of Internet of Things technology in pork supply chain, 
enterprises  of  breeding  and  processing  can  establish 
effective  recall  management  system  and  provide 
information about farms, processors and dates of pork 
and  its  processed  products  to  downriver  distributors, 
retailers  and  consumers.  Relevant  information  can  be 
found through SCOR model with code of RFID of each 
piece of pork product. Consumers, as buyers and eaters 
of  pork  products,  can  also  send  the  code  of  RFID  to 
notified  bodies  to  inquire  related  information,  which 
facilitates 
the  protection  of  personal  health  and 
consumer rights. 
 
To 
improve 
management: 
Building  platform  for  supply  chain  information  to 
ensure  pig  supply  quality  and  safety:  According  to 
the characteristics of different pig in the supply chain, 
we have to collect, transmit and deal with information 
in  the  course  of  breeding,  production  and  processing, 
transportation, storage, sales and other courses and then 
build  fresh  pig  and  pig  packaging  two  traceability 
information systems. On this basis, we can set up public 
information  platform  for  pig  quality  and  safety  of 
supply  chain  based  on  supply  chain 
integration, 
realizing traceability regulation for the whole process of 
food 
synchronous 
information 
flow,  workflow  among 
different  departments  and  information  sharing,  which 
improve  the  pertinence  and  effectiveness  of  the  pig 
safety  management work. Therefore, on one hand, the 
workload of human input related regulatory data can be 
decreased  and  the  traceability  of  product  can  be 
ensured, which can improve the quality of the product 
safety,  upgrade 
the 
enterprise  and  brand  value;  On 
the  other  hand, 
supervision efficiency can be enhanced and costs can be 
reduced, which can ensure the health and safety of food 
supply.  
 
Building  modern  pig  distribution  center:  Pig 
logistics  distribution  centre  is  one  of  the  important 
control  nodes  for  the  supply  chain  of  pig  quality  and 
safety. First, we can do centralized management for pig 
in  the  logistics  distribution  centre  and  realize  unified 
procurement,  reprocessing  and  distribution,  ensuring 
the  quality  and  hygiene  of  pig  and  safety  control  for 
pig;  Secondly,  we  can  construct  socialized  and 
specialized  pig  logistics  service  system  and  set  up 
professional  third  party  pig  logistics  enterprises  to 
prevent  pig  rot  and  pollution  in  the  process  of 
transportation;  Finally,  pig  logistics  distribution  centre 
can  put  forward  reward  mechanism  for  downstream
