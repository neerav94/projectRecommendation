1. INTRODUCTION 

Sensor networks  are  commonly  used  for  environmental 
monitoring  applications.  The  basic  aim  is  to  improve 
knowledge  on  the  surrounding  environment.  Sometimes 
monitoring campaigns are necessary for risk assessment and 
management  purposes.  In  fact,  attention  has  to  be  paid 
towards  those processes  that can put people  life  at risk. In 
such cases, the main goal of the monitoring is to verify the 
status  of  our  habitat  in  order  to  keep  under  control  the 
quality  level  of  life.  In  this  manuscript,  the  authors  focus 
attention on the landslide issue. Landslide is a phenomenon 
widely spread in the Mediterranean, and it is often cause of 
death and economic damages. It represents a natural process 
that  shapes  the  Earth  surface,  [1].  As  a  matter  of  fact,  it 
affects  principally  mountainous  areas  and  zones  with  cut 
slopes.  The  consequences  of  such  a  process  can  be 
catastrophic when it occurs in proximity of residential areas. 
Landslide risk assessment is an interesting field of research 
where  measurements  and  data  processing  need  specific

monitoring processes can avoid or reduce possible harms for 
the exposed population. Suitable measurement systems and 
data  processing  models  can  allow  risky  situations  to  be 
characterized.  In  this  way,  warning  or  alert  events  can  be 
timely managed by means of corrective actions. 

Landslide identification requires a careful knowledge of 
the  slope  process  and  of  its  relationship  with  geology, 
geomorphology,  hydrogeology  features  of  the  soil.  Further 
influence  factors  are  the  climate  and  the  vegetation.  The 
most  common  monitoring 
systems  are  based  on 
topographical  and  geological  data  or  satellite  images,  [6], 
[7].  Segmentation  algorithms  are  used  to  detect  the  soil 
characteristics. In such applications, JSEG algorithm shows 
the best results, [8]. Models of diagnostic image are based 
on  the  analysis  of  topographic  features  (slope,  soil  shape 
curvature,  distance  from  inhabited  areas)  and  geologic 
features  (geology,  distance  from  lineament),  [9].  Further 
information on type of soil, precipitation, vegetation index is 
considered  for  optimizing  the  recognition  of  landslide 
triggering  events,  [10].  At  the  moment,  assessment  or 
prediction of landslide hazards are based on hydrogeological 
models.  Typically,  these  models  are  used  to  estimate  the 
probability of a landslide occurrence by means of historical 
or  statistical  analysis  of  previous  events  in  the  monitored 
area, [11]. Landslide hazard maps are consequently drawn, 
[12]. Such statistical models often are cause of possible false 
alarms.  Differently,  the  availability  of real-time  data  based 
on  measurements  of  soil  movements  or  triggering  events 
could  improve  the  reliability  of  such  hazard  assessment 
models. Consequently, damages and death can be predicted 
and reduced by means of suitable emergency plans. 

In detail, triggering events represent the starting event of 
a  landslide.  Often  the  time  interval  between  a  triggering 
event  and  the  landslide  process  is  sufficient  for  executing 
prompt  intervention  actions.  When  real  measurements  are 
accessible, more reliable decisions can be taken using a set 
of  parameters  or  information  concerning  geology,  type  of 
soil, slope steepness, morphology of the area, precipitation, 
vegetation  cover,  temperature  and  humidity,  population 
density  and  human  activity  in  the  area.  Nevertheless  the

possible 

In this sight, the authors propose the design of a complex 
measurement  system  for  monitoring  landslide  triggering 
events. The considered case study concerns a populated area 
neighbour  urban  centre.  An  innovative  and  automated 
measurement  system  has  been  projected  for  predicting 
landslide  occurrences.  The  network,  by  using 
IoT 
technology,  shares  information  with  a  remote  workstation. 
So  data  are  remotely  processed  by  suitable  algorithms  in 
order  to  characterize  starting  land  movements.  The  aim  of 
the present paper is to provide a methodical approach to the 
design  of  landslide  monitoring  networks.  So  it  intends  to 
overcome  the  limits  of  the  present  monitoring  systems 
reducing 
occurrences.  The 
technological  advances  in  communication  and  networking 
fields suggest new solutions for real-time monitoring, [13]-
[19].  Nevertheless,  such  advances  entail  new 
issues 
concerning the management and complexity of the system. 
The  new  concept  of  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  provides  a 
novel approach in designing wireless sensor networks. Thus 
a  variety  of  things  as  sensors,  measurement  systems, 
actuators,  can  exchange  data  with  each  other  in  order  to 
improve  available  information.  Internet  can  represent  the 
basic  communication  infrastructure  for  networks  extended 
along wide geographical areas. Nevertheless, with reference 
to the considered application case, the landslide monitoring 
needs  specific  accuracy  and  reliability  requirements.  So 
different  issues  are  still  open.  Further  important  aspects 
concern the natural changes of the environment. So network 
architecture has to be adapted dynamically. Sensors have to 
be added or removed and sampling plans have to be flexible 
according to the specifications. Consequently, data have to 
be  shared  and  promptly  processed  for  supporting  civil 
protection actions. 

classes:  removal  of  material  (natural  erosion,  excavation); 
removal of vegetation (deforestation due to natural events or 
human activities, fires); moisture (precipitation, damages to 
water  system,  artificial  deviation  of  water  flow  or  river); 
increase  of  weight  (snow,  eruption,  addition  of  material); 
vibration  (earthquake,  blasting  or  use  of  heavy  means  of 
transport, loud noise), [26].  
A  first  approach  for  the  risk  assessment  is  based  on 
statistical analysis of geological and environmental factors, 
[27],  [28].  The  aim  of  such  models  is  to  estimate  the 
occurrence  of  landslide  in  a  specific  location.  They  use 
historical records concerning landslide frequency in the area 
to predict future occurrences. 

Further  complex  models  are  based  on  processing  aerial 
photographs or satellite images. In this case, a deterministic 
approach is used. In detail, mechanical and cinematic laws 
allow  researchers  to  control  the  instability  of  soil  and  to 
predict potential movements. Usually statistical models offer 
better  results  when  wide  areas  are  considered  or  when  the 
deterministic model is too complex to be defined. However, 
historical data on landslide frequency of the monitored area 
can affect results. In fact when a landslide occurs geological 
and 
topographical  settings  change  causing  different 
conditions  of 
is 
suggested  when  landslides  are  predicable  by  means  of 
physic  laws.  Nevertheless  the  latter  models  fail  when 
temporal aspects are considered. In conclusion no approach 
can  be  considered  a  definite  and  general  solution  to  the 
issue.  According  to  the  monitored  area  and  to  the  type  of 
landslide a specific method can provide better results. 

instability.  Deterministic  approach 

Standard  classification  of  landslides  is  based  on  the 
mechanism  of  the  soil  movement  and  on  the  type  of 
displaced  material:  fall,  topple,  lateral  spreading,  slide, 
flows, creeps [29]-[33].  

2.  LANDSLIDES AND CLASSIFICATION 

Landslide is a natural process of soil movement due to 
slope.  High  slope  angles  involve  greater  stress  in  the  soil 
triggering movements which can originate a landslide. The 
probability of a landslide event increases if the soil is made 
up  unconsolidated  material  and  debris,  [20].  Low  slope 
angles can unlikely generate landslides due to low gradients. 
Nevertheless it is not a general rule. So that natural slopes 
made  up  bedrock  are  not  necessarily  cause  of  landslides, 
[21]. As a matter of fact, slope and type of soil are the main 
factors to be considered in predicting landslide events. 

Typically  landslides  are  generated  as  a  consequence  of 
triggering  episodes  or  triggers.  So  earthquakes,  rainfall, 
snow,  human  activities  can  facilitate  the  arising  of  soil 
movements,  [22]-[25].  According  to  the  type  of  triggering 
event,  different  impacts  on  the  geographical  area  can  be 
characterized.  Moreover,  duration,  intensity,  and  extent  of 
the triggering mechanism play an important role, as well as 
hydrogeological  and  morphological  features.  In  this  sight, 
landslides  are  often  difficult  to  predict.  Even  natural 
phenomena and human activities can alter the stability of a 
slope. Such triggering conditions can be classified into five

landslides  can  originate  by  a 
combination  of  the  previous  classes.  So  landslides  with 
complex  movements  (rotational  and 
translational)  are 
possible. Sometimes a landslide can develop into a different

1. INTRODUCTION 

Sensor networks  are  commonly  used  for  environmental 
monitoring  applications.  The  basic  aim  is  to  improve

such cases, the main goal of the monitoring is to verify the

attention on the landslide issue. Landslide is a phenomenon 
widely spread in the Mediterranean, and it is often cause of 
death and economic damages. It represents a natural process 
that  shapes  the  Earth  surface,  [1].  As  a  matter  of  fact,  it 
affects  principally  mountainous  areas  and  zones  with  cut

catastrophic when it occurs in proximity of residential areas. 
Landslide risk assessment is an interesting field of research

data  processing  models  can  allow  risky  situations  to  be

Landslide identification requires a careful knowledge of 
the  slope  process  and  of  its  relationship  with  geology,

the best results, [8]. Models of diagnostic image are based 
on  the  analysis  of  topographic  features  (slope,  soil  shape 
curvature,  distance  from  inhabited  areas)  and  geologic 
features  (geology,  distance  from  lineament),  [9].  Further 
information on type of soil, precipitation, vegetation index is 
considered  for  optimizing  the  recognition  of  landslide 
triggering  events,  [10].  At  the  moment,  assessment  or 
prediction of landslide hazards are based on hydrogeological 
models.  Typically,  these  models  are  used  to  estimate  the 
probability of a landslide occurrence by means of historical 
or  statistical  analysis  of  previous  events  in  the  monitored 
area, [11]. Landslide hazard maps are consequently drawn, 
[12]. Such statistical models often are cause of possible false 
alarms.  Differently,  the  availability  of real-time  data  based 
on  measurements  of  soil  movements  or  triggering  events 
could  improve  the  reliability  of  such  hazard  assessment 
models. Consequently, damages and death can be predicted 
and reduced by means of suitable emergency plans. 

In detail, triggering events represent the starting event of 
a  landslide.  Often  the  time  interval  between  a  triggering 
event  and  the  landslide  process  is  sufficient  for  executing 
prompt  intervention  actions.  When  real  measurements  are 
accessible, more reliable decisions can be taken using a set 
of  parameters  or  information  concerning  geology,  type  of 
soil, slope steepness, morphology of the area, precipitation, 
vegetation  cover,  temperature  and  humidity,  population 
density  and  human  activity  in  the  area.  Nevertheless  the

2.  LANDSLIDES AND CLASSIFICATION 

Landslide is a natural process of soil movement due to 
slope.  High  slope  angles  involve  greater  stress  in  the  soil 
triggering movements which can originate a landslide. The 
probability of a landslide event increases if the soil is made 
up  unconsolidated  material  and  debris,  [20].  Low  slope 
angles can unlikely generate landslides due to low gradients. 
Nevertheless it is not a general rule. So that natural slopes 
made  up  bedrock  are  not  necessarily  cause  of  landslides, 
[21]. As a matter of fact, slope and type of soil are the main 
factors to be considered in predicting landslide events. 

Typically  landslides  are  generated  as  a  consequence  of 
triggering  episodes  or  triggers.  So  earthquakes,  rainfall, 
snow,  human  activities  can  facilitate  the  arising  of  soil 
movements,  [22]-[25].  According  to  the  type  of  triggering 
event,  different  impacts  on  the  geographical  area  can  be 
characterized.  Moreover,  duration,  intensity,  and  extent  of 
the triggering mechanism play an important role, as well as 
hydrogeological  and  morphological  features.  In  this  sight, 
landslides  are  often  difficult  to  predict.  Even  natural 
phenomena and human activities can alter the stability of a 
slope. Such triggering conditions can be classified into five

The  purpose  of  landslide  risk  assessment  is  to  predict 
landslide hazards with reference to where, when and how it 
occurs,  [35],[36].  With  reference  to  the  first  issue,  it  is 
possible to characterize different classes of areas according 
to their use: urban, agrarian, water, forest and arid regions. 
Differently  considering 
to  predict  the 
magnitude  of  the  moving  mass  during  a  landslide  is  a 
complex  task  because  of  the  variety  of  landslide  types. 
Moreover, risk evaluation has also to estimate the economic 
and

environment,  number  of  people  dead  or  injured),  [37]. 
Typically, progressive and slow movements are not risky for 
human safety, but can have wide impacts on infrastructures. 
In  this  case  only  economic  loss  are  involved.  Differently, 
rapid and sudden movements of soil put population at high 
risk.  However,  consequences  are  not  limited  only  to 
structural damages and life loss. So risks include damages to 
economical  and  working  activities,  services,  facilities, 
vehicles.

The most common risk assessment models are based on 
the  estimation  of  some  parameters:  likelihood  of  slide, 
probability  of 
temporal  probability, 
vulnerability  and  elements  at  risk.  Vulnerability,  for 
example,  depends on  the position of  the  element  at  risk  in 
respect  to  the  landslide  process,  the  magnitude  of  the 
moving  soil,  its  rate  and  the  vegetation,  [34].  Vegetation 
index  is  typically  estimated  by  satellite  images  using 
spectral  reflectance  measurement  in  the  red  and  near-
infrared  regions  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum.  All  such 
factors  are  used  to  estimate  the  global  probability  of 
landslide occurrence.   

 Although  a  variety  of  models  and  methods  have  been 
proposed  in  literature,  no  technique  is  considered  the  gold 
standard.  Such  methods  suffer  generally  of  poor  accuracy 
and reproducibility. 

The landslide hazard zoning represents the final step of 
the monitoring activity, [12]. In this stage, risk assessment 
results  are  used  to  draw  hazard  maps  characterizing  the 
zones with greater risk. Such maps are drawn according to 
geological and topographical information on the monitored 
area.  The  map  is  clustered  in  zones  with  different  colours 
according  to  the  landslide  risk  level:  likely,  possible  or 
unlikely.   

3.  SENSOR NETWORK DESIGN 

Landslides affect a wide extent of the European territory. 
From an economic point of view, it is clearly unsustainable 
to  monitor  systematically  every  zone  subject  to  landslide 
events.  Since  in  the  risk  assessment,  the  population  injury 
and  life  have  greater  impact,  attention  is  turned  on  the 
populated  areas.  Consequently,  monitoring  campaigns  are  
typically performed along wide areas in proximity of urban 
or peopled zones. In this case, the extent of the area requires

system.  The  authors  in  previous  works  have  developed 
distributed 
environmental  monitoring 
applications,  [38]-[41].  So  the  design  of  a  measurement 
network  based  on  wireless  and  smart  web-sensors  is 
proposed.  The  sensors  are  spatially  displaced  along  the 
considered  area  according  to  topographical  information.  In 
detail,  a  partitioning  algorithm  divides  the  area  in  several 
local zones. The algorithm starts from available information 
concerning the population distribution and density in order 
to  detect  the  target  area.  Such  information  associated  to 
topographical  data  allows  algorithm  to  perform  the  best 
partition of the area. The number and size of the zones are 
chosen according to the desired resolution and accuracy of 
the  sampling  plan.  When  the  satellite  image  of  the  area  is 
acquired,  an  initial  partition  grid  is  applied.  In  addition, 
according  to  the  economic  resources  and  the  number  of 
sensors,  the  user  can  specify  the  desired  number  of 
partitions.  The  whole  area  is  so  divided  in  several  zones 
with the same size. Lack of economic sources represents the 
real  problem  of  the  actual  monitoring  campaigns.  For  this 
reason  the  best  solution  is  to  characterize  the  zones  which 
require more attention and a more careful monitoring. In this 
stage, it is possible to characterize the presence of sensible 
zones or elements at risk where greater attention has to be 
paid.  The  algorithm  thickens  further  the  partition  of  the 
sensible  zones.  So,  for  example,  zones  which  are  highly 
urbanized  and  densely  populated  have  higher  risks  in 
presence  of  hazardous 
the 
algorithm can perform a further clustering of the zones with 
higher  population  density  or  with  elements  at  risk.  In  this 
way, each sensible zone is divided in other four sub-zones,

situations.  Consequently

Higher levels of accuracy and resolution are obtained by 
partitioning  the  area  in  smaller  local  zones.  In  this  way, 
measurements provide more reliable data on the monitored 
area.  Nevertheless,  it  involves  higher  costs.  So,  a  balance 
between  costs  and  desired  accuracy/resolution  is  needed. 
Information  concerning  the  population  distribution  and 
density, the likelihood of slide, probability of spatial impact, 
the vulnerability of the elements at risk is considered. 

The  network  architecture  is  configurable  on  the  base  of 
topographical  and  environmental  information  on  the  area. 
The number and size of the zones can be adapted according 
to the needs. Each sensor has the task to collect information 
and  data  in  a  fixed  point  of  a  specific  local  zone.  Local 
sampling plans are defined according to the risk level in the

Abstract: In the present paper, the authors deal with the 
landslide  issue  and  the  associated  risk  management.  The 
design  of  a  sensor  network  for  monitoring  landslide 
triggering events is proposed. The network consists of web-
sensors using IoT technology to share measurement results 
and  information.  Data  are  acquired  and  processed  to 
characterize  the  occurrence  of  triggering  events  causing 
landslides.  The  aim  is  to  provide  timely  landslide  hazard 
maps. The projected measurement system is a configurable 
network  of  wireless  and  smart  sensors  geographically 
distributed.  The  monitored  area  is  divided  in  local  zones, 
each  zone  is  monitored  by  a  smart  sensor.  Topographical 
and environmental information is used to cluster the area in 
order to configure the network and the monitoring process. 
According to the desired resolution, an algorithm fixes the 
size and number of local zones. The single sensor is able to 
measure the sliding and spatial movements of soil by means 
of  accelerometers.  Each  sensing  node  transfers  data  to  a 
Web  page  by  a  HSDPA  modem  for  processing  stage. 
Information  can  be  remotely  analyzed  so  to  single  out 
hazard  and  risky  situations  for  the  population  in  the 
monitored area. Then suitable interventions and actions can 
be planned from the civil protection.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Sensor networks  are  commonly  used  for  environmental 
monitoring  applications.  The  basic  aim  is  to  improve 
knowledge  on  the  surrounding  environment.  Sometimes 
monitoring campaigns are necessary for risk assessment and 
management  purposes.  In  fact,  attention  has  to  be  paid 
towards  those processes  that can put people  life  at risk. In 
such cases, the main goal of the monitoring is to verify the 
status  of  our  habitat  in  order  to  keep  under  control  the 
quality  level  of  life.  In  this  manuscript,  the  authors  focus 
attention on the landslide issue. Landslide is a phenomenon 
widely spread in the Mediterranean, and it is often cause of 
death and economic damages. It represents a natural process 
that  shapes  the  Earth  surface,  [1].  As  a  matter  of  fact,  it 
affects  principally  mountainous  areas  and  zones  with  cut 
slopes.  The  consequences  of  such  a  process  can  be 
catastrophic when it occurs in proximity of residential areas. 
Landslide risk assessment is an interesting field of research 
where  measurements  and  data  processing  need  specific 

for 

requirements  of  accuracy.  Risk  evaluation,  hazard 
landslides  are

researchers, 
[2]-[5].  Methodological 
monitoring processes can avoid or reduce possible harms for 
the exposed population. Suitable measurement systems and 
data  processing  models  can  allow  risky  situations  to  be 
characterized.  In  this  way,  warning  or  alert  events  can  be 
timely managed by means of corrective actions. 

Landslide identification requires a careful knowledge of 
the  slope  process  and  of  its  relationship  with  geology, 
geomorphology,  hydrogeology  features  of  the  soil.  Further 
influence  factors  are  the  climate  and  the  vegetation.  The 
most  common  monitoring 
systems  are  based  on 
topographical  and  geological  data  or  satellite  images,  [6], 
[7].  Segmentation  algorithms  are  used  to  detect  the  soil 
characteristics. In such applications, JSEG algorithm shows 
the best results, [8]. Models of diagnostic image are based 
on  the  analysis  of  topographic  features  (slope,  soil  shape 
curvature,  distance  from  inhabited  areas)  and  geologic 
features  (geology,  distance  from  lineament),  [9].  Further 
information on type of soil, precipitation, vegetation index is 
considered  for  optimizing  the  recognition  of  landslide 
triggering  events,  [10].  At  the  moment,  assessment  or 
prediction of landslide hazards are based on hydrogeological 
models.  Typically,  these  models  are  used  to  estimate  the 
probability of a landslide occurrence by means of historical 
or  statistical  analysis  of  previous  events  in  the  monitored 
area, [11]. Landslide hazard maps are consequently drawn, 
[12]. Such statistical models often are cause of possible false 
alarms.  Differently,  the  availability  of real-time  data  based 
on  measurements  of  soil  movements  or  triggering  events 
could  improve  the  reliability  of  such  hazard  assessment 
models. Consequently, damages and death can be predicted 
and reduced by means of suitable emergency plans. 

In detail, triggering events represent the starting event of 
a  landslide.  Often  the  time  interval  between  a  triggering 
event  and  the  landslide  process  is  sufficient  for  executing 
prompt  intervention  actions.  When  real  measurements  are 
accessible, more reliable decisions can be taken using a set 
of  parameters  or  information  concerning  geology,  type  of 
soil, slope steepness, morphology of the area, precipitation, 
vegetation  cover,  temperature  and  humidity,  population 
density  and  human  activity  in  the  area.  Nevertheless  the 
resort  to  measurement  systems  geographically  displaced 
entails  high  costs  of  implementation  and  management. 
Furthermore  data  have  to  be  analysed  from  experts.  But 
interpretation errors  or poor accuracy of measurements  are

cause of underestimated hazards. For these reasons, most of 
the present landslide hazard maps are drawn only by using 
hydrogeological and statistical models, [12]. 

possible 

In this sight, the authors propose the design of a complex 
measurement  system  for  monitoring  landslide  triggering 
events. The considered case study concerns a populated area 
neighbour  urban  centre.  An  innovative  and  automated 
measurement  system  has  been  projected  for  predicting 
landslide  occurrences.  The  network,  by  using 
IoT 
technology,  shares  information  with  a  remote  workstation. 
So  data  are  remotely  processed  by  suitable  algorithms  in 
order  to  characterize  starting  land  movements.  The  aim  of 
the present paper is to provide a methodical approach to the 
design  of  landslide  monitoring  networks.  So  it  intends  to 
overcome  the  limits  of  the  present  monitoring  systems 
reducing 
occurrences.  The 
technological  advances  in  communication  and  networking 
fields suggest new solutions for real-time monitoring, [13]-
[19].  Nevertheless,  such  advances  entail  new 
issues 
concerning the management and complexity of the system. 
The  new  concept  of  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  provides  a 
novel approach in designing wireless sensor networks. Thus 
a  variety  of  things  as  sensors,  measurement  systems, 
actuators,  can  exchange  data  with  each  other  in  order  to 
improve  available  information.  Internet  can  represent  the 
basic  communication  infrastructure  for  networks  extended 
along wide geographical areas. Nevertheless, with reference 
to the considered application case, the landslide monitoring 
needs  specific  accuracy  and  reliability  requirements.  So 
different  issues  are  still  open.  Further  important  aspects 
concern the natural changes of the environment. So network 
architecture has to be adapted dynamically. Sensors have to 
be added or removed and sampling plans have to be flexible 
according to the specifications. Consequently, data have to 
be  shared  and  promptly  processed  for  supporting  civil 
protection actions. 

classes:  removal  of  material  (natural  erosion,  excavation); 
removal of vegetation (deforestation due to natural events or 
human activities, fires); moisture (precipitation, damages to 
water  system,  artificial  deviation  of  water  flow  or  river); 
increase  of  weight  (snow,  eruption,  addition  of  material); 
vibration  (earthquake,  blasting  or  use  of  heavy  means  of 
transport, loud noise), [26].  
A  first  approach  for  the  risk  assessment  is  based  on 
statistical analysis of geological and environmental factors, 
[27],  [28].  The  aim  of  such  models  is  to  estimate  the 
occurrence  of  landslide  in  a  specific  location.  They  use 
historical records concerning landslide frequency in the area 
to predict future occurrences. 

Further  complex  models  are  based  on  processing  aerial 
photographs or satellite images. In this case, a deterministic 
approach is used. In detail, mechanical and cinematic laws 
allow  researchers  to  control  the  instability  of  soil  and  to 
predict potential movements. Usually statistical models offer 
better  results  when  wide  areas  are  considered  or  when  the 
deterministic model is too complex to be defined. However, 
historical data on landslide frequency of the monitored area 
can affect results. In fact when a landslide occurs geological 
and 
topographical  settings  change  causing  different 
conditions  of 
is 
suggested  when  landslides  are  predicable  by  means  of 
physic  laws.  Nevertheless  the  latter  models  fail  when 
temporal aspects are considered. In conclusion no approach 
can  be  considered  a  definite  and  general  solution  to  the 
issue.  According  to  the  monitored  area  and  to  the  type  of 
landslide a specific method can provide better results. 

instability.  Deterministic  approach 

Standard  classification  of  landslides  is  based  on  the 
mechanism  of  the  soil  movement  and  on  the  type  of 
displaced  material:  fall,  topple,  lateral  spreading,  slide, 
flows, creeps [29]-[33].  

2.  LANDSLIDES AND CLASSIFICATION 

Landslide is a natural process of soil movement due to 
slope.  High  slope  angles  involve  greater  stress  in  the  soil 
triggering movements which can originate a landslide. The 
probability of a landslide event increases if the soil is made 
up  unconsolidated  material  and  debris,  [20].  Low  slope 
angles can unlikely generate landslides due to low gradients. 
Nevertheless it is not a general rule. So that natural slopes 
made  up  bedrock  are  not  necessarily  cause  of  landslides, 
[21]. As a matter of fact, slope and type of soil are the main 
factors to be considered in predicting landslide events. 

Typically  landslides  are  generated  as  a  consequence  of 
triggering  episodes  or  triggers.  So  earthquakes,  rainfall, 
snow,  human  activities  can  facilitate  the  arising  of  soil 
movements,  [22]-[25].  According  to  the  type  of  triggering 
event,  different  impacts  on  the  geographical  area  can  be 
characterized.  Moreover,  duration,  intensity,  and  extent  of 
the triggering mechanism play an important role, as well as 
hydrogeological  and  morphological  features.  In  this  sight, 
landslides  are  often  difficult  to  predict.  Even  natural 
phenomena and human activities can alter the stability of a 
slope. Such triggering conditions can be classified into five

The  purpose  of  landslide  risk  assessment  is  to  predict 
landslide hazards with reference to where, when and how it 
occurs,  [35],[36].  With  reference  to  the  first  issue,  it  is 
possible to characterize different classes of areas according 
to their use: urban, agrarian, water, forest and arid regions. 
Differently  considering 
to  predict  the 
magnitude  of  the  moving  mass  during  a  landslide  is  a 
complex  task  because  of  the  variety  of  landslide  types. 
Moreover, risk evaluation has also to estimate the economic

environment,  number  of  people  dead  or  injured),  [37]. 
Typically, progressive and slow movements are not risky for 
human safety, but can have wide impacts on infrastructures. 
In  this  case  only  economic  loss  are  involved.  Differently, 
rapid and sudden movements of soil put population at high 
risk.  However,  consequences  are  not  limited  only  to 
structural damages and life loss. So risks include damages to 
economical  and  working  activities,  services,  facilities,

The most common risk assessment models are based on 
the  estimation  of  some  parameters:  likelihood  of  slide, 
probability  of 
temporal  probability, 
vulnerability  and  elements  at  risk.  Vulnerability,  for 
example,  depends on  the position of  the  element  at  risk  in 
respect  to  the  landslide  process,  the  magnitude  of  the 
moving  soil,  its  rate  and  the  vegetation,  [34].  Vegetation 
index  is  typically  estimated  by  satellite  images  using 
spectral  reflectance  measurement  in  the  red  and  near-
infrared  regions  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum.  All  such 
factors  are  used  to  estimate  the  global  probability  of 
landslide occurrence.   

 Although  a  variety  of  models  and  methods  have  been 
proposed  in  literature,  no  technique  is  considered  the  gold 
standard.  Such  methods  suffer  generally  of  poor  accuracy 
and reproducibility. 

The landslide hazard zoning represents the final step of 
the monitoring activity, [12]. In this stage, risk assessment 
results  are  used  to  draw  hazard  maps  characterizing  the 
zones with greater risk. Such maps are drawn according to 
geological and topographical information on the monitored 
area.  The  map  is  clustered  in  zones  with  different  colours 
according  to  the  landslide  risk  level:  likely,  possible  or 
unlikely.   

3.  SENSOR NETWORK DESIGN 

Landslides affect a wide extent of the European territory. 
From an economic point of view, it is clearly unsustainable 
to  monitor  systematically  every  zone  subject  to  landslide 
events.  Since  in  the  risk  assessment,  the  population  injury 
and  life  have  greater  impact,  attention  is  turned  on  the 
populated  areas.  Consequently,  monitoring  campaigns  are  
typically performed along wide areas in proximity of urban 
or peopled zones. In this case, the extent of the area requires

system.  The  authors  in  previous  works  have  developed 
distributed 
environmental  monitoring 
applications,  [38]-[41].  So  the  design  of  a  measurement 
network  based  on  wireless  and  smart  web-sensors  is 
proposed.  The  sensors  are  spatially  displaced  along  the 
considered  area  according  to  topographical  information.  In 
detail,  a  partitioning  algorithm  divides  the  area  in  several 
local zones. The algorithm starts from available information 
concerning the population distribution and density in order 
to  detect  the  target  area.  Such  information  associated  to 
topographical  data  allows  algorithm  to  perform  the  best 
partition of the area. The number and size of the zones are 
chosen according to the desired resolution and accuracy of 
the  sampling  plan.  When  the  satellite  image  of  the  area  is 
acquired,  an  initial  partition  grid  is  applied.  In  addition, 
according  to  the  economic  resources  and  the  number  of 
sensors,  the  user  can  specify  the  desired  number  of 
partitions.  The  whole  area  is  so  divided  in  several  zones 
with the same size. Lack of economic sources represents the 
real  problem  of  the  actual  monitoring  campaigns.  For  this 
reason  the  best  solution  is  to  characterize  the  zones  which 
require more attention and a more careful monitoring. In this 
stage, it is possible to characterize the presence of sensible 
zones or elements at risk where greater attention has to be 
paid.  The  algorithm  thickens  further  the  partition  of  the 
sensible  zones.  So,  for  example,  zones  which  are  highly 
urbanized  and  densely  populated  have  higher  risks  in 
presence  of  hazardous 
the 
algorithm can perform a further clustering of the zones with 
higher  population  density  or  with  elements  at  risk.  In  this 
way, each sensible zone is divided in other four sub-zones,

situations.  Consequently

Higher levels of accuracy and resolution are obtained by 
partitioning  the  area  in  smaller  local  zones.  In  this  way, 
measurements provide more reliable data on the monitored 
area.  Nevertheless,  it  involves  higher  costs.  So,  a  balance 
between  costs  and  desired  accuracy/resolution  is  needed. 
Information  concerning  the  population  distribution  and 
density, the likelihood of slide, probability of spatial impact, 
the vulnerability of the elements at risk is considered. 

The  network  architecture  is  configurable  on  the  base  of 
topographical  and  environmental  information  on  the  area. 
The number and size of the zones can be adapted according 
to the needs. Each sensor has the task to collect information 
and  data  in  a  fixed  point  of  a  specific  local  zone.  Local 
sampling plans are defined according to the risk level in the

sub-zone. The position of the sensor within the single local 
zone  is  defined  by  simulations  based  on  geological  and 
topographical features of the zone. The single sensing node 
has been projected according to the guidelines of the IEEE 
1451 Standard, [42]. It is a wireless smart sensor with three 
accelerometers  displaced  along  the  axes  of  an  orthogonal  
Cartesian system xyz. Signals are conditioned by means of a 
circuit,  while  a  16  bit  A/D  converter  digitalizes  they. 
Conditioning  circuit  is  based  on  multiple  amplification 
stages with  an  auto-scale  setting,  as  previously  it has  been 
developed from the authors in [43]-[45]. The control unit is 
based on a microcontroller architecture which manages the 
data-flow operations. The single web-sensor sends data to a 
Web page by a HSDPA modem.

In  this  way,  the  Web  page  stores  information  on  the 
whole  monitored  area.  Data  are  so  shared  by  means  of 
Internet network in order to make easier the access and the 
exchange  of 
information  among  several  monitoring 
networks.  The  IoT  architecture  offers  several  advantages 
like 
timely  availability  of 
information and the simple interconnection between sensor 
networks.  In  fact  the  use  of  IoT  technology  allows  to 
simplify  the  design  of  monitoring  systems  distributed  on 
wide areas spatially distant. User can get access to the Web 
page by a password in order to have an overview of the area. 
So  data  concerning  measurements,  GPS  information,  and 
topographical  records  are  used  to  characterize  each  local 
zone in terms of landslide risk assessment. The aim of the 
present work is to provide practical tools for civil protection 
by drawing alarm reports about landslide triggering events. 
A hazard map is therefore drawn to characterize the zones

4.  CONCLUSION 

The  design  of  a  wireless  sensor  network  for  landslide

Abstract: In the present paper, the authors deal with the 
landslide  issue  and  the  associated  risk  management.  The 
design  of  a  sensor  network  for  monitoring  landslide 
triggering events is proposed. The network consists of web-
sensors using IoT technology to share measurement results 
and  information.  Data  are  acquired  and  processed  to 
characterize  the  occurrence  of  triggering  events  causing 
landslides.  The  aim  is  to  provide  timely  landslide  hazard 
maps. The projected measurement system is a configurable 
network  of  wireless  and  smart  sensors  geographically 
distributed.  The  monitored  area  is  divided  in  local  zones, 
each  zone  is  monitored  by  a  smart  sensor.  Topographical 
and environmental information is used to cluster the area in 
order to configure the network and the monitoring process. 
According to the desired resolution, an algorithm fixes the 
size and number of local zones. The single sensor is able to 
measure the sliding and spatial movements of soil by means 
of  accelerometers.  Each  sensing  node  transfers  data  to  a 
Web  page  by  a  HSDPA  modem  for  processing  stage. 
Information  can  be  remotely  analyzed  so  to  single  out 
hazard  and  risky  situations  for  the  population  in  the 
monitored area. Then suitable interventions and actions can 
be planned from the civil protection.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Sensor networks  are  commonly  used  for  environmental 
monitoring  applications.  The  basic  aim  is  to  improve 
knowledge  on  the  surrounding  environment.  Sometimes 
monitoring campaigns are necessary for risk assessment and 
management  purposes.  In  fact,  attention  has  to  be  paid 
towards  those processes  that can put people  life  at risk. In 
such cases, the main goal of the monitoring is to verify the 
status  of  our  habitat  in  order  to  keep  under  control  the 
quality  level  of  life.  In  this  manuscript,  the  authors  focus 
attention on the landslide issue. Landslide is a phenomenon 
widely spread in the Mediterranean, and it is often cause of 
death and economic damages. It represents a natural process 
that  shapes  the  Earth  surface,  [1].  As  a  matter  of  fact,  it 
affects  principally  mountainous  areas  and  zones  with  cut 
slopes.  The  consequences  of  such  a  process  can  be 
catastrophic when it occurs in proximity of residential areas. 
Landslide risk assessment is an interesting field of research 
where  measurements  and  data  processing  need  specific 

for 

requirements  of  accuracy.  Risk  evaluation,  hazard 
landslides  are 
assessment  or  prediction  of

challenges 
researchers, 
[2]-[5].  Methodological 
monitoring processes can avoid or reduce possible harms for 
the exposed population. Suitable measurement systems and 
data  processing  models  can  allow  risky  situations  to  be 
characterized.  In  this  way,  warning  or  alert  events  can  be 
timely managed by means of corrective actions. 

Landslide identification requires a careful knowledge of 
the  slope  process  and  of  its  relationship  with  geology, 
geomorphology,  hydrogeology  features  of  the  soil.  Further 
influence  factors  are  the  climate  and  the  vegetation.  The 
most  common  monitoring 
systems  are  based  on 
topographical  and  geological  data  or  satellite  images,  [6], 
[7].  Segmentation  algorithms  are  used  to  detect  the  soil 
characteristics. In such applications, JSEG algorithm shows 
the best results, [8]. Models of diagnostic image are based 
on  the  analysis  of  topographic  features  (slope,  soil  shape 
curvature,  distance  from  inhabited  areas)  and  geologic 
features  (geology,  distance  from  lineament),  [9].  Further 
information on type of soil, precipitation, vegetation index is 
considered  for  optimizing  the  recognition  of  landslide 
triggering  events,  [10].  At  the  moment,  assessment  or 
prediction of landslide hazards are based on hydrogeological 
models.  Typically,  these  models  are  used  to  estimate  the 
probability of a landslide occurrence by means of historical 
or  statistical  analysis  of  previous  events  in  the  monitored 
area, [11]. Landslide hazard maps are consequently drawn, 
[12]. Such statistical models often are cause of possible false 
alarms.  Differently,  the  availability  of real-time  data  based 
on  measurements  of  soil  movements  or  triggering  events 
could  improve  the  reliability  of  such  hazard  assessment 
models. Consequently, damages and death can be predicted 
and reduced by means of suitable emergency plans. 

In detail, triggering events represent the starting event of 
a  landslide.  Often  the  time  interval  between  a  triggering 
event  and  the  landslide  process  is  sufficient  for  executing 
prompt  intervention  actions.  When  real  measurements  are 
accessible, more reliable decisions can be taken using a set 
of  parameters  or  information  concerning  geology,  type  of 
soil, slope steepness, morphology of the area, precipitation, 
vegetation  cover,  temperature  and  humidity,  population 
density  and  human  activity  in  the  area.  Nevertheless  the 
resort  to  measurement  systems  geographically  displaced 
entails  high  costs  of  implementation  and  management. 
Furthermore  data  have  to  be  analysed  from  experts.  But 
interpretation errors  or poor accuracy of measurements  are

cause of underestimated hazards. For these reasons, most of 
the present landslide hazard maps are drawn only by using 
hydrogeological and statistical models, [12]. 

possible 

In this sight, the authors propose the design of a complex 
measurement  system  for  monitoring  landslide  triggering 
events. The considered case study concerns a populated area 
neighbour  urban  centre.  An  innovative  and  automated 
measurement  system  has  been  projected  for  predicting 
landslide  occurrences.  The  network,  by  using 
IoT 
technology,  shares  information  with  a  remote  workstation. 
So  data  are  remotely  processed  by  suitable  algorithms  in 
order  to  characterize  starting  land  movements.  The  aim  of 
the present paper is to provide a methodical approach to the 
design  of  landslide  monitoring  networks.  So  it  intends  to 
overcome  the  limits  of  the  present  monitoring  systems 
reducing 
occurrences.  The 
technological  advances  in  communication  and  networking 
fields suggest new solutions for real-time monitoring, [13]-
[19].  Nevertheless,  such  advances  entail  new 
issues 
concerning the management and complexity of the system. 
The  new  concept  of  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  provides  a 
novel approach in designing wireless sensor networks. Thus 
a  variety  of  things  as  sensors,  measurement  systems, 
actuators,  can  exchange  data  with  each  other  in  order  to 
improve  available  information.  Internet  can  represent  the 
basic  communication  infrastructure  for  networks  extended 
along wide geographical areas. Nevertheless, with reference 
to the considered application case, the landslide monitoring 
needs  specific  accuracy  and  reliability  requirements.  So 
different  issues  are  still  open.  Further  important  aspects 
concern the natural changes of the environment. So network 
architecture has to be adapted dynamically. Sensors have to 
be added or removed and sampling plans have to be flexible 
according to the specifications. Consequently, data have to 
be  shared  and  promptly  processed  for  supporting  civil 
protection actions. 

classes:  removal  of  material  (natural  erosion,  excavation); 
removal of vegetation (deforestation due to natural events or 
human activities, fires); moisture (precipitation, damages to 
water  system,  artificial  deviation  of  water  flow  or  river); 
increase  of  weight  (snow,  eruption,  addition  of  material); 
vibration  (earthquake,  blasting  or  use  of  heavy  means  of 
transport, loud noise), [26].  
A  first  approach  for  the  risk  assessment  is  based  on 
statistical analysis of geological and environmental factors, 
[27],  [28].  The  aim  of  such  models  is  to  estimate  the 
occurrence  of  landslide  in  a  specific  location.  They  use 
historical records concerning landslide frequency in the area 
to predict future occurrences. 

Further  complex  models  are  based  on  processing  aerial 
photographs or satellite images. In this case, a deterministic 
approach is used. In detail, mechanical and cinematic laws 
allow  researchers  to  control  the  instability  of  soil  and  to 
predict potential movements. Usually statistical models offer 
better  results  when  wide  areas  are  considered  or  when  the 
deterministic model is too complex to be defined. However, 
historical data on landslide frequency of the monitored area 
can affect results. In fact when a landslide occurs geological 
and 
topographical  settings  change  causing  different 
conditions  of 
is 
suggested  when  landslides  are  predicable  by  means  of 
physic  laws.  Nevertheless  the  latter  models  fail  when 
temporal aspects are considered. In conclusion no approach 
can  be  considered  a  definite  and  general  solution  to  the 
issue.  According  to  the  monitored  area  and  to  the  type  of 
landslide a specific method can provide better results. 

instability.  Deterministic  approach 

Standard  classification  of  landslides  is  based  on  the 
mechanism  of  the  soil  movement  and  on  the  type  of 
displaced  material:  fall,  topple,  lateral  spreading,  slide, 
flows, creeps [29]-[33].  

2.  LANDSLIDES AND CLASSIFICATION 

Landslide is a natural process of soil movement due to 
slope.  High  slope  angles  involve  greater  stress  in  the  soil 
triggering movements which can originate a landslide. The 
probability of a landslide event increases if the soil is made 
up  unconsolidated  material  and  debris,  [20].  Low  slope 
angles can unlikely generate landslides due to low gradients. 
Nevertheless it is not a general rule. So that natural slopes 
made  up  bedrock  are  not  necessarily  cause  of  landslides, 
[21]. As a matter of fact, slope and type of soil are the main 
factors to be considered in predicting landslide events. 

Typically  landslides  are  generated  as  a  consequence  of 
triggering  episodes  or  triggers.  So  earthquakes,  rainfall, 
snow,  human  activities  can  facilitate  the  arising  of  soil 
movements,  [22]-[25].  According  to  the  type  of  triggering 
event,  different  impacts  on  the  geographical  area  can  be 
characterized.  Moreover,  duration,  intensity,  and  extent  of 
the triggering mechanism play an important role, as well as 
hydrogeological  and  morphological  features.  In  this  sight, 
landslides  are  often  difficult  to  predict.  Even  natural 
phenomena and human activities can alter the stability of a 
slope. Such triggering conditions can be classified into five

landslides  can  originate  by  a 
combination  of  the  previous  classes.  So  landslides  with 
complex  movements  (rotational  and 
translational)  are 
possible. Sometimes a landslide can develop into a different

Risk  assessment  requires  the

The  purpose  of  landslide  risk  assessment  is  to  predict 
landslide hazards with reference to where, when and how it 
occurs,  [35],[36].  With  reference  to  the  first  issue,  it  is 
possible to characterize different classes of areas according 
to their use: urban, agrarian, water, forest and arid regions. 
Differently  considering 
to  predict  the 
magnitude  of  the  moving  mass  during  a  landslide  is  a 
complex  task  because  of  the  variety  of  landslide  types. 
Moreover, risk evaluation has also to estimate the economic 
and 
infrastructures,  buildings, 
environment,  number  of  people  dead  or  injured),  [37]. 
Typically, progressive and slow movements are not risky for 
human safety, but can have wide impacts on infrastructures. 
In  this  case  only  economic  loss  are  involved.  Differently, 
rapid and sudden movements of soil put population at high 
risk.  However,  consequences  are  not  limited  only  to 
structural damages and life loss. So risks include damages to 
economical  and  working  activities,  services,  facilities, 
vehicles.

impact, 

The most common risk assessment models are based on 
the  estimation  of  some  parameters:  likelihood  of  slide, 
probability  of 
temporal  probability, 
vulnerability  and  elements  at  risk.  Vulnerability,  for 
example,  depends on  the position of  the  element  at  risk  in 
respect  to  the  landslide  process,  the  magnitude  of  the 
moving  soil,  its  rate  and  the  vegetation,  [34].  Vegetation 
index  is  typically  estimated  by  satellite  images  using 
spectral  reflectance  measurement  in  the  red  and  near-
infrared  regions  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum.  All  such 
factors  are  used  to  estimate  the  global  probability  of 
landslide occurrence.   

 Although  a  variety  of  models  and  methods  have  been 
proposed  in  literature,  no  technique  is  considered  the  gold 
standard.  Such  methods  suffer  generally  of  poor  accuracy 
and reproducibility. 

The landslide hazard zoning represents the final step of 
the monitoring activity, [12]. In this stage, risk assessment 
results  are  used  to  draw  hazard  maps  characterizing  the 
zones with greater risk. Such maps are drawn according to 
geological and topographical information on the monitored 
area.  The  map  is  clustered  in  zones  with  different  colours 
according  to  the  landslide  risk  level:  likely,  possible  or 
unlikely.   

3.  SENSOR NETWORK DESIGN 

Landslides affect a wide extent of the European territory. 
From an economic point of view, it is clearly unsustainable 
to  monitor  systematically  every  zone  subject  to  landslide 
events.  Since  in  the  risk  assessment,  the  population  injury 
and  life  have  greater  impact,  attention  is  turned  on  the 
populated  areas.  Consequently,  monitoring  campaigns  are  
typically performed along wide areas in proximity of urban 
or peopled zones. In this case, the extent of the area requires 
the  use  of  distributed  architecture  for  the  measurement

system.  The  authors  in  previous  works  have  developed 
distributed 
environmental  monitoring 
applications,  [38]-[41].  So  the  design  of  a  measurement 
network  based  on  wireless  and  smart  web-sensors  is 
proposed.  The  sensors  are  spatially  displaced  along  the 
considered  area  according  to  topographical  information.  In 
detail,  a  partitioning  algorithm  divides  the  area  in  several 
local zones. The algorithm starts from available information 
concerning the population distribution and density in order 
to  detect  the  target  area.  Such  information  associated  to 
topographical  data  allows  algorithm  to  perform  the  best 
partition of the area. The number and size of the zones are 
chosen according to the desired resolution and accuracy of 
the  sampling  plan.  When  the  satellite  image  of  the  area  is 
acquired,  an  initial  partition  grid  is  applied.  In  addition, 
according  to  the  economic  resources  and  the  number  of 
sensors,  the  user  can  specify  the  desired  number  of 
partitions.  The  whole  area  is  so  divided  in  several  zones 
with the same size. Lack of economic sources represents the 
real  problem  of  the  actual  monitoring  campaigns.  For  this 
reason  the  best  solution  is  to  characterize  the  zones  which 
require more attention and a more careful monitoring. In this 
stage, it is possible to characterize the presence of sensible 
zones or elements at risk where greater attention has to be 
paid.  The  algorithm  thickens  further  the  partition  of  the 
sensible  zones.  So,  for  example,  zones  which  are  highly 
urbanized  and  densely  populated  have  higher  risks  in 
presence  of  hazardous 
the 
algorithm can perform a further clustering of the zones with 
higher  population  density  or  with  elements  at  risk.  In  this 
way, each sensible zone is divided in other four sub-zones, 
see Fig. 2. 

situations.  Consequently 

Fig. 2. Partitioning of the area. 

 

Higher levels of accuracy and resolution are obtained by 
partitioning  the  area  in  smaller  local  zones.  In  this  way, 
measurements provide more reliable data on the monitored 
area.  Nevertheless,  it  involves  higher  costs.  So,  a  balance 
between  costs  and  desired  accuracy/resolution  is  needed. 
Information  concerning  the  population  distribution  and 
density, the likelihood of slide, probability of spatial impact, 
the vulnerability of the elements at risk is considered. 

The  network  architecture  is  configurable  on  the  base  of 
topographical  and  environmental  information  on  the  area. 
The number and size of the zones can be adapted according 
to the needs. Each sensor has the task to collect information 
and  data  in  a  fixed  point  of  a  specific  local  zone.  Local 
sampling plans are defined according to the risk level in the

sub-zone. The position of the sensor within the single local 
zone  is  defined  by  simulations  based  on  geological  and 
topographical features of the zone. The single sensing node 
has been projected according to the guidelines of the IEEE 
1451 Standard, [42]. It is a wireless smart sensor with three 
accelerometers  displaced  along  the  axes  of  an  orthogonal  
Cartesian system xyz. Signals are conditioned by means of a 
circuit,  while  a  16  bit  A/D  converter  digitalizes  they. 
Conditioning  circuit  is  based  on  multiple  amplification 
stages with  an  auto-scale  setting,  as  previously  it has  been 
developed from the authors in [43]-[45]. The control unit is 
based on a microcontroller architecture which manages the 
data-flow operations. The single web-sensor sends data to a 
Web page by a HSDPA modem.

the  sharing  of  data, 

In  this  way,  the  Web  page  stores  information  on  the 
whole  monitored  area.  Data  are  so  shared  by  means  of 
Internet network in order to make easier the access and the 
exchange  of 
information  among  several  monitoring 
networks.  The  IoT  architecture  offers  several  advantages 
like 
timely  availability  of 
information and the simple interconnection between sensor 
networks.  In  fact  the  use  of  IoT  technology  allows  to 
simplify  the  design  of  monitoring  systems  distributed  on 
wide areas spatially distant. User can get access to the Web 
page by a password in order to have an overview of the area. 
So  data  concerning  measurements,  GPS  information,  and 
topographical  records  are  used  to  characterize  each  local 
zone in terms of landslide risk assessment. The aim of the 
present work is to provide practical tools for civil protection 
by drawing alarm reports about landslide triggering events. 
A hazard map is therefore drawn to characterize the zones

suitable actions can be projected for safeguarding population
