Abstract—We propose demonstrating an IEEE 802.11ah wire-
less local area network (WLAN) prototype that is conﬁgured
as a self-contained machine-2-machine (M2M) wireless sensor
system. Because the IEEE 802.11ah protocol standardization is
under way, no commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) IEEE 802.11ah
Wi-Fi product is available yet. However, the proposed prototype
has the potential to solve this issue and allows an over-the-air
protocol performance assessment. A software deﬁned radio (SDR)
platform is developed, that consists of universal software radio
peripheral (USRP) devices combined with radio frequency (RF)
daughter-boards operating at the 900 MHz ISM-band. Addition-
ally, the 2×2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) operation is realized,
which requires modiﬁcations on the PHY implementation. This
demo provides a practical and cost-efﬁcient research platform for
the upcoming IEEE 802.11ah WLAN and its use in M2M and
Internet of Things (IoT) wireless long-range access networks.

I. INTRODUCTION

The IEEE 802.11ah Task Group (TG) is under way to
standardize wireless local area networks (WLANs) that will
use carrier frequencies in the 900 MHz industry, scientiﬁc,
and medical (ISM) bands. These so-called sub-1 GHz (S1G)
WLANs, operating in the ultra high frequency (UHF) band,
will offer unique features, such as longer outdoor coverage
range and energy consumption reduction to enable so-called
Wi-Fi sensor networks. Additionally, IEEE 802.11ah WLAN
will be an alternative to IEEE 802.15 short-range sensor
systems and will enable cost-efﬁcient machine-to-machine
(M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) wireless access networks.
Compared to the upcoming IEEE 802.11af standard, both
WLAN protocols aim to exploit the increased penetration of
wireless signals at lower frequencies. However, IEEE 802.11af
requires a set of additional architectural elements, including
spectrum a data base and a location server to enable TV white
space (TVWS) access [1] . Hence, the IEEE 802.11ah WLAN
is a cost-efﬁcient and practical solution for long-range short-
burst data trafﬁc in the S1G ISM band. A challenge with
the IEEE 802.11ah WLAN is the limited channel bandwidth
of 1 MHz (Japanese region). The use of an IEEE 802.11ah
WLAN prototype would be beneﬁcial to evaluate the band-
width constraints. To meet
this demand the creation of a
software-based WLAN is an alternative to chip-based WLANs,

We propose a multiple-input multiple-output

in which new physical layer (PHY) functions and media access
control (MAC) schemes can be implemented and evaluated.
(MIMO)
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) S1G
WLAN that uses software deﬁned radio (SDR) in combination
with open-software GNU Radio [2] . We argue that
the
proposed system has many advantages. Firstly, it is simple and
cost-efﬁcient, because the required S1G radio frequency RF
front-end is realized using universal software radio peripheral
(USRP). Secondly, it is modular, because RF components can
be changed to different frequencies and the required software
can be extended. These advantages come with a cost in per-
formance limitations, because almost all system calculations
are executed in software on a host (a personal computer) and
therefore cannot be as fast as customized ﬁeld programmable
gate array (FPGA) boards or chip-based WLANs.

Testing platforms for wireless communication, and in partic-
ular for MIMO broadband systems, have been widely proposed
for cellular systems and WLANs operating at 2.4 GHz or
higher carrier frequencies. In [3] the authors propose an
SDR system using USRP to evaluate hierarchical modulation
schemes at 2.6 GHz to avoid interference from WLAN systems
operating at 2.4 GHz. Another example of using SDRs is
in [4] where a real-time system using USRP [5] and GNU
Radio [6] operating at 2.4 GHz is proposed. The motivation to
use USRP in comparison with other small form factor SDRs
is that the USRP has reliable and better user support and
allows the use of free open-source software. In [7] the authors
propose a 4×4 MIMO-OFDM platform by using FPGAs
operating at 902-928 MHz band. However, the motivation was
to apply the 915 MHz band to avoid the highly congested
2.4 GHz band to conduct measurement campaigns including
three different outdoor locations. However no results were
reported on how to design a MIMO-OFDM system operating
at narrow-bandwidths.

The IEEE 802.11ah TG aims to standardize a long-range
WLAN system that will allow up to 1 km range at moderate
data rate up to 100 kbps [8]. The modulation scheme proposed
supports multi-antenna systems and path loss models for
longer outdoor range, robustness and energy efﬁciency. To the
best of our knowledge there has been no reports on IEEE
802.11ah prototype WLANs.

II. PROPOSED IEEE 802.11AH WLAN PLATFORM

We propose a low-cost solution that allows a simple op-
eration of MIMO-OFDM functions in a wireless hardware
using a conﬁgurable software radio platform. Here, we propose
using open-source software to design a generic platform,
that, is independent from the carrier frequency fc and allows
MIMO-OFDM operation in narrow-band wireless systems,
e.g., 1 MHz channel bandwidth. We realize a real-time MIMO-
OFDM encoding/decoding which is state-of-the-art in other
platforms to evaluate wireless transmissions over-the-air. How-
ever, real-time encoding schemes require high performance
hardware due to exhaustive FFT/IFFT operations.

We selected the USRP 1 which supports two internal RF
boards without the requirement of having an external clock [5].
We setup the USRP 1 with two SBX daughter-boards operating
at fc = 923 MHz. The SBX boards cover a frequency band
between 400 MHz - 4.4 GHz, with a nominal noise ﬁgure of
4 dB. Transmit power can be selected anywhere between
30 mW - 100 mW. Fortunately, SBX supports the sub-1 GHz
band so that this board is useful for transmitting a MIMO-
OFDM modulated signal at fc = 923 MHz. We found that the
I/O-control of the SBX boards requires signiﬁcant changes in
the serial USRP interface, which we implemented as a new
USRP Hardware Driver (UHD) library for SBX support at
fc = 923 MHz. We added the library to support two SBX
boards conﬁgured as 2×2 MIMO multi-antenna system in a
single USRP. In Table I the test parameters are presented,
which we used in our wireless M2M setup.

Fig. 1 illustrates the demo setup. The setup consists of
an IEEE 802.11ah sender and receiver node. At the sender
node an external USB M2M sensor is attached. The M2M
sensor reports variations in temperature and humidity with a
sending interval Ts = 1 s, with 100 B packet size. Our platform
is installed with Ubuntu Linux, version 11.04, running on
personal computers with two Pentium-4 processors. We found
that GNU Radio, version 3.2.2, is a valid compromise between
supporting the applied multi-antenna MIMO-OFDM software

framework [9] and the required UHD driver and SBX inter-
face. The IEEE 802.11ah prototype provides a helpful research
platform for the upcoming IEEE 802.11ah WLAN protocol
amendment. It is practical, cost-efﬁcient, and easy to install;
thus, it is argued that the prototype has a signiﬁcant merit
for the research community. For instance, the main challenge
of IEEE 802.11ah WLAN is the interference caused by of
out-of-band (OOB) emissions. Because of the presence of
other wireless systems that coexist in the S1G narrow-band,
such as RFID and IEEE 802.15.4 devices, OOB suppression
is required, similar to the challenges in IEEE 802.22 or
IEEE 802.11af systems [1]. The prototype can be useful in
the assessment of OOB emissions and proposed remedies,
including inﬁnite impulse response (IIR) ﬁltering [10].

III. DEMONSTRATION DETAILS

A. Demo scope

The scope of the demo is twofold. Firstly, with the help
of the demo wireless experts can easily engage in discussions
of the usefulness of the new IEEE 802.11ah WLAN protocol.
IEEE 802.11ah is an alternative to IEEE 802.15.4 protocols.
The new IEEE 802.11ah WLAN protocol features are useful
for M2M and IoT applications, such as sensor data exchange.
Secondly, due to the fact that IEEE 802.11ah off-the-shelf
products are not available yet, a discussion of other potential
prototypes and testbed platforms can further help to promote
the applicability of IEEE 802.11ah, e.g., in M2M and IoT
wireless testbeds. The proposed IEEE 802.11ah demo setup
transmits sensing data, such as temperature and humidity meter
information, as a form of M2M trafﬁc over-the-air between
an IEEE 802.11ah sender and receiver node. Fig. 2 shows a

and two USRPs.

B. Equipment, space and setup time

The IEEE 802.11ah prototype demo requires the following

equipment that is planned to be brought to the conference:

1) 2 x laptop PCs. The ﬁrst laptop shows the real-time
monitored transmission performance of IEEE 802.11ah
(I/Q chart, MIMO channel gain, MCS rate). The second
laptop displays the real-time report of the USB tempera-
ture sensor, as an M2M application scenario. A separate
programmed GUI is used to show the temperature and
humidity data to the LCN demo audience.

2) 2 x USRP units (Tx/Rx), equipped with SBX daughter-
boards. The USRPs are connected via wired cables to
mitigate wireless interference. In addition, wired con-
nection between the USRPs is required not to violate
any radio laws, when using un-certiﬁed radio equipment.
However, the wired connection allows a discussion of
selected MCS rates and 2 × 2 MIMO real-time channel
gain display during the demo.

3) A third laptop is planned to be brought

to show a

recorded video of the entire setup (if needed).

4) USB cables, power connectors.
The IEEE 802.11ah demo setup (laptops, USRPs) are lo-
cated on a table (2 × 2 m). A power supply with 6 power
sockets is required. Setup time is estimated to be 1 hour,
including time to transport the equipment to the LCN demo
desk. The demo is self-contained and does not require any
Internet access. Alternatively, a recorded video of the entire
running prototype setup can be shown instead, including a
visualization of a recorded batch-ﬁle of the M2M sensor trafﬁc
(wireless transmission of temperature and humidity data from
the IEEE 802.11ah WLAN sender node to the receiver node).

IV. CONCLUSIONS

The upcoming IEEE 802.11ah protocol offers advanced
protocol features that are beneﬁcial for future M2M and IoT
wireless access networks. The new WLAN offers moderate
data rates at longer range compared to IEEE 802.15.4 sys-
tems. Thus, new service value to recent sensing applications
can be added in a cost-efﬁcient way. The proposed IEEE
802.11ah prototype demonstrates the applicability of the new
WLAN protocol for sensor applications because no COTS
IEEE 802.11ah Wi-Fi products are available yet. An SDR-
prototyping was proposed that uses USRP and GNU Radio
to evaluate the IEEE 802.11ah WLAN performance over-the-
air operating at the sub-1 GHz ISM-band. The 2×2 MIMO-
OFDM operation was implemented to examine the wire-
less transmission boundaries of a narrow-band WLAN. The
prototype provides a practical and cost-efﬁcient opportunity
to test the upcoming IEEE 802.11ah WLAN standard and
its usefulness for M2M and IoT long-range access network
deployments.

In this demonstration we will show the applicability of IEEE
802.11ah WPAN protocol for M2M sensing applications. We
will demonstrate a self-contained wireless M2M sensor data
scenario in a multi-node IEEE 802.11ah WLAN setup. The
LCN demo audience will be easily motivated to discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of the upcoming IEEE 802.11ah
WLAN with the help of the proposed IEEE 802.11ah WLAN
prototype.
