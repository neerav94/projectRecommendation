Abstract—In the future we will rely on applications built
on top of the Internet of Things (IoT). Example applications
are smart cities, smart grids and smart healthcare. These IoT
applications require a reliable service with predictable quality,
and that sensor data and actuator commands are delivered
reliably and timely. Unfortunately, IoT performance is highly
affected by environmental conditions, especially by ambient
temperature. It is therefore necessary to conﬁgure an IoT system
such that sufﬁcient application performance is provided under
all environmental conditions that may be encountered.

In this demonstration, we show how ambient temperature
affects the performance of an IoT application. Speciﬁcally, we
connect remotely to a large-scale temperature-controlled testbed
and show how temperature affects the operation of a state-of-the-
art routing protocol. Using a local setup, we further demonstrate
how the impact of temperature on communication links can be
easily captured and modelled in order to inform the design of
communication protocols robust to high temperature ﬂuctuations.

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

The Internet of Things (IoT) will enable applications of
utmost societal value including smart cities, smart grids and
smart healthcare. For the majority of such applications, strict
dependability requirements are placed on IoT performance, and
sensor data as well as actuator commands must be delivered
reliably and timely. Whilst existing IoT solutions are designed
to provide such dependable performance, many typically fail,
as embedded wireless systems are signiﬁcantly affected by
their often hostile environment. Radio interference from other
wireless equipment and electrical appliances impairs commu-
nication, whilst
temperature and humidity variations affect
battery capacity and electronics.

Recent research has revealed that operations of wireless
sensor systems are largely affected by their on-board tem-
perature. Temperature variations can signiﬁcantly affect the
quality of wireless links [1], battery capacity and discharge [2],
as well as clock drift [3]. Deployed wireless sensor systems
can undergo substantial variation in temperature depending on
the enclosure and on the deployed location. Systems exposed
to sunshine can easily experience high temperatures up to 70
degrees Celsius – especially if the packaging absorbs infra-red
(IR) radiation [4]. High temperature may also be accompanied
by high variation as seen in [5], which showed that
the
on-board temperature of a system can vary in an outdoor
deployment by as much as 35◦C in one hour and 56◦C over
the course of a day. In previous work, we showed that this
extreme variance can reduce the received signal strength (RSS)
between communicating nodes by more than 6 dB [5], which

is enough to change the packet reception rate (PRR) of what
was a good link from 100% to 0%.

Whilst RSS ﬂuctuations on a link caused by temperature
changes have been well studied [1], [5], the effect of these
changes on networking protocols have received little attention.
A deep analysis of how such effects on individual links affect
the operation of networking protocols is necessary to inform
the design of more dependable systems. In this demonstration
we present an initial investigation into how variations in tem-
perature affect the received signal strength and the behaviour
of state-of-the-art IoT routing protocols. We also demonstrate
how temperature effects on RSS can be captured and modelled
in order to inform the design of robust networking protocols
able to mitigate the effects of temperature variations.

II. DEMO DESCRIPTION

Our demo is made up of two parts. In the ﬁrst part, we
will connect to TempLab [6], a temperature-controlled exper-
imental infrastructure with the ability of precisely varying the
on-board temperature of wireless sensor nodes, to demonstrate
how temperature affects IoT communications. We put speciﬁc
emphasis on the operation of a state-of-the-art routing protocol.
In the second part, we will demonstrate how such temperature
effects on communications can be quantiﬁed by measuring the
signal degradation using a local demonstration made of four
Maxfor MTM-CM5000MSP wireless sensor nodes of which
two will be heated using infra-red heating lamps.

Remote testbed at TU Graz. For the ﬁrst part of the demo,
we will connect to a live experiment running on our experimen-
tal infrastructure at TU Graz. The testbed will be conﬁgured
to replay pre-recorded individual outdoor temperature traces
on 17 Maxfor MTM-CM5000MSP wireless sensor nodes. The
nodes will be running Contiki’s IPv6 Routing Protocol for
Low-Power and Lossy Networks (ContikiRPL) [7] with each
node periodically sending packets to the sink. We will illustrate
the impact that temperature variations have on key network
metrics such as throughput, delay and lifetime, showing that it
is fundamental that temperature effects are taken into account
when designing robust networking protocols. Along with the
sensor nodes and controllable infra-red lamps,
the testbed
facility in Graz offers the possibility to observe an experiment
using a steerable Web-cam (Figure 1). This facility will be
used during the demo to monitor the live experiment.

Along-side the observation of the remote demo, we will use a
small-scale version of our testbed infrastructure at the EWSN

III. CONCLUSIONS

Variations in environmental properties can signiﬁcantly
affect the operations of wireless embedded systems, which can
break IoT applications. In this demonstration, we have shown
that temperature variations can drastically affect the perfor-
mance of communication protocols, with particular focus on
the state-of-the-art ContikiRPL. We have further demonstrated
how the temperature effects on received signal strength can be
captured to parametrize a ﬁrst-order model that can be used in
future protocols to predict changes in link quality and minimize
the impact of temperature ﬂuctuations.

demo session to capture how link quality degrades at high
temperatures. Speciﬁcally, we will use four Maxfor MTM-
CM5000MSP wireless sensor nodes of which two will be
heated using infra-red heating lamps similar to the ones shown
in Figure 1. The demo will show how the dependency between
temperature and link quality can be determined in real-time by
measuring temperature and signal strength information.

In particular, we form two independent links by dividing
the sensor nodes into pairs. Each link operates on individual
channels to avoid effects caused by interference. Sensor nodes
will run the same Contiki software periodically sending pack-
ets using a predeﬁned transmission power to their intended
receiver with temperature information measured using the on-
board SHT11 digital sensor. On the receiver, statistics about the
received packets1 are logged using the serial port and collected
by an application that computes the decrease in RSS as a
function of temperature, as we proposed in [5]. An intuitive
web-application will visualise this data as shown in Figure 2.
1We collect hardware-based link quality metrics in IEEE 802.15.4 compliant
radio transceivers, namely the received signal strength indicator upon packet
reception (RSSI) and in absence of packet transmissions (noise ﬂoor).
