Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  has  many  forms  of  applications  including  healthcare  and  industrial  systems.  So, 
healthcare systems mainly using the interconnected devices to create an IoT network enthusiastic to assessment, 
automatically detecting the situation and monitors the patients, where the medical interferences are mandatory. 
So, IoT alone can form an information network that interconnects hospitals, peoples, healthcare devices, home 
environment and other workstations. 
 

II.  IMPLEMENTATION AND RELATED WORKS: 

Implementation  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  flexible  and  accessible  results  to  allowing  the  healthcare 
applications to serve patients with better treatment, also done with the remote patient monitoring and effective 
medical  data  handling.  There  are  some  of  different  characteristics  are  needed  to  implement  the  healthcare 
service in the Environment. 

1) Ontology Evaluation:  

In  this  part  inputs  are  converted  into  function  in  which  patients  symptoms  are  analysed,  diseases  are 
located, and all the information’s are put into the remote database. When the patient first enters the hospitals, the 
physical characteristics of the diseases will be primarily determined by the doctor.  

The determined functions are divided into the classes and sub classes. Classes are represents the patients basic 
information and subclasses are represents detailed diseases information. 

2) Global Ontology Comparison:  

In  this  evaluated  ontology  compared  to  the  globally  stored  diseases  ontology  on  the  base  of  the 
knowledge  base  system.  Global  ontology  contains  the  two  forms  of  ontology,  these  are  disease  ontology  and 
resource ontology. Disease ontology contains the patient basic and medical information and resource ontology 
covers medical resources such that doctors, medical devices, etc.  

3) Similarity Calculations: 

Input  the  inquiry  content  of  the  symptom  manually.  Compare  the  input  symptom  with  all  the  global 
disease  ontology  in  the  knowledge  base.  Perform  similarity  matching  of  the  symptoms  automatically  for 
similarity matching. Automate the selection of the most similar case in the knowledge base. It is easy to find out 
what  kinds  of  devices  are  needed  for  the  corresponding  symptoms  and  rehabilitation  strategies  through  the 
ontology. 

4) Design Optimization: 

The  final  phase  of  smart  design  process  in  which  the  procedure,  methods,  scopes,  and  duration  of  all  of  the 
separate  actions.  Parameter  optimization  is  essential  to  make  assured  that  the  particulars  come  across  the 
requirements  from  structure.  Automatic  designs  help  to  build  a  system  where  a  new  patient  could  be  quickly 
diagnosed,  corresponding  help  strategy  can  soon  be  worked  out,  and  associated  medical  properties  can  be 
distributed in a short time. With ontology ensuring the well-ordered knowledge structure.

physical health system using IoT. Additionally to understand the symptoms and the medical assets by the use of 
an  Ontology.  And  also  an  Ontology  supports  to  create  a  rehabilitation  strategy  and  also  to  reconfigure  the 
medical  assets  based  on  the  specfic  requirements  of  the  patients  habitually  and  rapidly.  So,  based  on  the 
objectives  IoT  aims  to  interconnect  all  the  resources  and  easily  provide  an  immediate  information 
interaction.major role in this system is to applying the Ontology for the creation of rehabilitation strategy and to 
build the subsystem analsys for collabration of the patients informations or identity. The basic idea of IoT is the 
pervasive  presence  of  things  and  objects  that  are  interconnected  and  are  able  to  cooperate  with  each  other  to 
reach a common goal.IoT extents a set of technologies that supports a extensive range of things to interact and 
interconnect  among  themselves  using  networking  technologies.  Two  important  features,  including  the  quick 
construction of rehabilitation  system and the easy  sharing  of domain knowledge,  make the system  unique and 
perform excellent, as IoT.ontology have played a significant role in the process. It aims to interconnect all the 
resources and provide immediate information interaction.  

 
For  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  system  must  be  have  the  some  of  the  different  form  of  the 
sections  shown  in  Fig.2.  First  one  is  the  Human  machine    interaction  and  second  one  is    multidisiciplinary 
optimizations which is formed in the many opreations on the system architecture. And third one is manging the 
applications by the database  and class  mapping in the knoeledge base.The Human  machine interaction can be 
achived  by  the  base  of  the  resources  and  human,  like  doctors,  nurse  and  patients  are  the  human  realted

INTRODUCTION: 

Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  devices  can  be  mostly  used  to  facilitate  distant  health  monitoring  and 
emergency healthcare systems. At the present we are facing many challenges in the real  world, which have to 
deal  realistically.  By  the  use  of  IoT  challenges  are  rehabilitate,  which  consumes  more  time,  resources  and 
manpower. In the recent years the rehabilitation of Internet resources has become popular and also development 
of the smart applications like smart home. Compared to the traditional system, the smart rehabilitation is aiming 
at  providing  an  effective  treatment,  sufficient  interaction  and  quick  reconfiguration  to  making  the  determined 
use of the medical resources according to the patient’s particular requirements probable. Internet of Things is the 
primary technology for interconnecting all the medical resources of the rehabilitation systems. Also to combine 
the  Networking  technologies  that  enables  a  wide  range  of  applications,  devices  or  things  to  interact  and 
communicate among themselves.

Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  has  many  forms  of  applications  including  healthcare  and  industrial  systems.  So, 
healthcare systems mainly using the interconnected devices to create an IoT network enthusiastic to assessment, 
automatically detecting the situation and monitors the patients, where the medical interferences are mandatory. 
So, IoT alone can form an information network that interconnects hospitals, peoples, healthcare devices, home 
environment and other workstations. 
 

II.  IMPLEMENTATION AND RELATED WORKS: 

Implementation  of  the  Internet  of  Things  is  flexible  and  accessible  results  to  allowing  the  healthcare 
applications to serve patients with better treatment, also done with the remote patient monitoring and effective 
medical  data  handling.  There  are  some  of  different  characteristics  are  needed  to  implement  the  healthcare 
service in the Environment. 

1) Ontology Evaluation:  

In  this  part  inputs  are  converted  into  function  in  which  patients  symptoms  are  analysed,  diseases  are 
located, and all the information’s are put into the remote database. When the patient first enters the hospitals, the 
physical characteristics of the diseases will be primarily determined by the doctor.  

The determined functions are divided into the classes and sub classes. Classes are represents the patients basic 
information and subclasses are represents detailed diseases information. 

2) Global Ontology Comparison:  

In  this  evaluated  ontology  compared  to  the  globally  stored  diseases  ontology  on  the  base  of  the 
knowledge  base  system.  Global  ontology  contains  the  two  forms  of  ontology,  these  are  disease  ontology  and 
resource ontology. Disease ontology contains the patient basic and medical information and resource ontology 
covers medical resources such that doctors, medical devices, etc.  

3) Similarity Calculations: 

Input  the  inquiry  content  of  the  symptom  manually.  Compare  the  input  symptom  with  all  the  global 
disease  ontology  in  the  knowledge  base.  Perform  similarity  matching  of  the  symptoms  automatically  for 
similarity matching. Automate the selection of the most similar case in the knowledge base. It is easy to find out 
what  kinds  of  devices  are  needed  for  the  corresponding  symptoms  and  rehabilitation  strategies  through  the 
ontology. 

4) Design Optimization: 

The  final  phase  of  smart  design  process  in  which  the  procedure,  methods,  scopes,  and  duration  of  all  of  the 
separate  actions.  Parameter  optimization  is  essential  to  make  assured  that  the  particulars  come  across  the 
requirements  from  structure.  Automatic  designs  help  to  build  a  system  where  a  new  patient  could  be  quickly 
diagnosed,  corresponding  help  strategy  can  soon  be  worked  out,  and  associated  medical  properties  can  be 
distributed in a short time. With ontology ensuring the well-ordered knowledge structure.

In  Proposed  system  an  Ontology  based  automating  design  methodology  for  smart  medicine  and 
physical health system using IoT. Additionally to understand the symptoms and the medical assets by the use of 
an  Ontology.  And  also  an  Ontology  supports  to  create  a  rehabilitation  strategy  and  also  to  reconfigure  the 
medical  assets  based  on  the  specfic  requirements  of  the  patients  habitually  and  rapidly.  So,  based  on  the 
objectives  IoT  aims  to  interconnect  all  the  resources  and  easily  provide  an  immediate  information 
interaction.major role in this system is to applying the Ontology for the creation of rehabilitation strategy and to 
build the subsystem analsys for collabration of the patients informations or identity. The basic idea of IoT is the 
pervasive  presence  of  things  and  objects  that  are  interconnected  and  are  able  to  cooperate  with  each  other  to 
reach a common goal.IoT extents a set of technologies that supports a extensive range of things to interact and 
interconnect  among  themselves  using  networking  technologies.  Two  important  features,  including  the  quick 
construction of rehabilitation  system and the easy  sharing  of domain knowledge,  make the system  unique and 
perform excellent, as IoT.ontology have played a significant role in the process. It aims to interconnect all the 
resources and provide immediate information interaction.  

 
For  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  system  must  be  have  the  some  of  the  different  form  of  the 
sections  shown  in  Fig.2.  First  one  is  the  Human  machine    interaction  and  second  one  is    multidisiciplinary 
optimizations which is formed in the many opreations on the system architecture. And third one is manging the 
applications by the database  and class  mapping in the knoeledge base.The Human  machine interaction can be 
achived  by  the  base  of  the  resources  and  human,  like  doctors,  nurse  and  patients  are  the  human  realted 
resoureces  and  devices  such  the  RFID,  ambulance,  medical  resources  are  the  interact  to  the  human 
resources.Second, Multidisciplinary optimizations which is used to perform the design of the automated design 
mehodology and the major role in the system architecture, because it creates the all strategy of the system and 
also to provide the prescription to patient automatically.Third, Managing applications is used to manage all the 
resources  and  the  patients  records  also.  the    patients  records      also  maintained  by  classes  and  sub  classes  as 
explained  in  implemenatation.  In  application  management  also  persorms  the  design  collabration,  information 
and application integration based on the database and the knowledge base in the system.

V.  CONCLUSION: 

We realized IoT is the universal occurrence of things and objects that are intersected and are capable to 
work  together  with  each  other  to  extent  a  common  goal.  IoT  extents  a  set  of  technologies  that  enable  a  wide 
range  of  things  to  act  together  and  communicate  among  themselves  using  networking  knowledge.  A 
rehabilitation  system  is  developed  using  IoT-based  technologies,  SOA  methods,  and  multidisciplinary 
optimization methods. Ontology places the base for disease diagnosis and resource distribution. In proposed, an 
ontology-based  automating  design  methodology  for  smart  medicine  and  physical  health  system  using  IoT 
technology.  This  system  must  be  both  effective  and  efficient  for  the  information  sharing.  Two  important 
features,  including  the  quick  construction  of  restoration  system  and  the  easy  allotment  of  domain  knowledge, 
which  should  make  the  system  as  distinctive  and  perform  admirable,  as  IoT  and  ontology  have  played  a 
important role in the method.

explained  in  implemenatation.  In  application  management  also  persorms  the  design  collabration,  information 
and application integration based on the database and the knowledge base in the system.

Generation of automated design: 

The  generation  of  the  automate  design  method  should  be  have  some  of  the  stages  explained  in  the 
 
implementation and related  works. When the patient or doctors inputs the symptoms of the diseases, it can be 
compared to the global ontology based on knowledge base and select their most similar case in the knowledge 
base. After the automated design methodology mapping to classes and sub classes of the already stored patients 
records.

And  subsystem  can  optimize  that  the  patient’s  records  based  on  their  diseases  and  basic  information.  Finally 
design  collaboration  can  take  major  role  in  the  design  scheme  to  provide  the  prescription  to  the  patient  after 
verification of the doctors. By using this system can be effective to the medical and healthcare systems. 

IV.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 

 

 
The  Proposed  architecture  of  IoT  based  physical  health  system  that  can  be  integrated  to  the  some 
rehabilitation strategy by collecting the patient basic information’s and symptoms and also manages the medical 
history. System determines that proper reconfiguration of the Medical resources can develop the performance of 
the system and also surely opportuneness to the patients.

 The utilization of the medical resources must be used properly. Based on the design of system is effective and 
can help to the smart medicine system by generating the prescription. By invoking the RFID to interconnection 
of the all the resources and interact with the server during the reconfiguration of the patients medical resources 
and to provide solutions quickly. The performance of this can be increased to more efficient when compare to 
the existing system shown in fig.5.

By evaluating the performance of the smart system has been evaluating the reconfiguration and the effectiveness 
of producing the patient treatment prescription. 

 

V.  CONCLUSION: 

We realized IoT is the universal occurrence of things and objects that are intersected and are capable to 
work  together  with  each  other  to  extent  a  common  goal.  IoT  extents  a  set  of  technologies  that  enable  a  wide 
range  of  things  to  act  together  and  communicate  among  themselves  using  networking  knowledge.  A 
rehabilitation  system  is  developed  using  IoT-based  technologies,  SOA  methods,  and  multidisciplinary 
optimization methods. Ontology places the base for disease diagnosis and resource distribution. In proposed, an 
ontology-based  automating  design  methodology  for  smart  medicine  and  physical  health  system  using  IoT 
technology.  This  system  must  be  both  effective  and  efficient  for  the  information  sharing.  Two  important 
features,  including  the  quick  construction  of  restoration  system  and  the  easy  allotment  of  domain  knowledge, 
which  should  make  the  system  as  distinctive  and  perform  admirable,  as  IoT  and  ontology  have  played  a 
important role in the method.
