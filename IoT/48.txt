Abstract:    Internet  of  things  (IoT)  is  an  emerging  paradigm 
where  the  devices  around  us  (persistent  and  non-persistent)  are 
connected  to  each  other  to  provide  seamless  communication,  and 
contextual services.  In the IoT, each device cannot be authenticated 
in the short time due to unbounded number of devices, and receipt of 
their  authentication  request  at  the  same  time.  Therefore,  secure,  and 
efficient  group  authentication,  and  authorization  scheme  is  required 
that  authenticates  a  group  of  devices  at  once  in  the  context  of 
resource  constrained  IoT.  This  paper  presents  novel  Threshold 
Cryptography-based  Group  Authentication  (TCGA)  scheme  for  the 
IoT  which  verifies  authenticity  of  all  the  devices  taking  part  in  the 
group  communication.  This  paper  also  presents  TCGA  framework 
which  is  flexible  and  secure.  The  proposed  TCGA  scheme  is 
implemented  for  WI-FI  environment,  and  the  result  shows  that 
TCGA  scheme  is  lightweight,  and  alleviates  the  effect  of  battery 
exhaustion attack. This paper also presents time analysis, and formal 
security  analysis  of  TCGA  scheme  which  shows  that  the  proposed 
TCGA scheme is safe from the replay, man-in-the-middle attack, and 
is scalable in nature.

I.  Introduction 

The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  refers  to  the  network 
interconnection  of  everyday  devices.  An  IoT  is  a  world-wide 
network  of  inter-connected  devices  uniquely  addressable, 
based  on  a  standard  communication  protocol.  In  the  IoT, 
people are surrounded by different types of computing devices 
which are billion in number, varied in size, and capabilities to 
communicate  with  each  other.  Devices  are  having  limited 
capabilities, and computing resources which range from Radio 
Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  tags  to  embedded  devices, 
PDA, and sensor nodes. IoT integrates the physical world with 
the  information  world,  and  provides  ambient  services,  and 
applications. 
IoT  networks  allow  users,  devices,  and 
applications  in  different  physical  locations  to  communicate 
seamlessly  with  one  another.  In  brief,  the  IoT  facilitates 
different  communication  patterns  like:  user-to-user,  user-to-
device,  device-to-device,  and  devices-to-user.  However,  the 
decentralized, and distributed nature of the IoT face challenges 
in  authentication,  access  control,  and  Identity  Management 
(IdM)  [2,  3,  and  4].  There  are  various  challenges  to  design 
security 
like  constraints,  and 
heterogeneous  communication,  resource  constraints,  and 
distributed nature.

IdM  of  devices  in  the  IoT  is  one  of  the  important 
challenges,  and  can  be  achieved  by  efficient  authentication 
schemes which are simple, secure, and lightweight. In the IoT, 
there  are  unbounded  numbers  of  heterogeneous  devices 
talking  to  each  other.  Each  device  should  not  be  able  to 
authenticate  during  the  short  time.  Due  to  the  scale  of 

devices 

to 

secure 

achieve 

individual 

economics,  more  than  hundreds  of  devices  may  request 
authentication  approval  at  the  same  time.  To  this  purpose, 
lightweight, scalable, and secure group authentication scheme 
is required which will authenticate groups of devices, and not 
the 
group 
communication.  This  paper  proposes  a  group  authentication 
scheme  using  Paillier  Threshold  Cryptography  [5,  6,  and  7] 
which  is  a  public  key  variant  of  the  (t,  n)  threshold  scheme 
where t is threshold, and n is number of group members. The 
Paillier  Cryptosystem  helps 
to  achieve  homomorphic 
properties, which is most suited for privacy preservation in the 
IoT  applications.  It  is  probabilistic  asymmetric  public  key 
encryption  system  which  uses  randomness  in  an  encryption 
algorithm,  so  that  when  encrypting  the  same,  plaintext  for 
several  times.  This  will  yield  different  cipher  texts.  The  key 
properties  of  Paillier  Cryptosystem  include  homomorphic 
addition, 
[5,  8]. 
Essentially,  the  Paillier  Cryptosystem  comprises  of  three 
algorithms:  key  generation,  encryption  and  decryption.    The 
proposed  TCGA  scheme  is  used  to  verify  the  authenticity  of 
all  the  members  taking  part  in  a  group  oriented  application. 
The  scheme  also  helps  in  establishing  a  shared  secret  key 
between  the  members  of  the  group  which  can  be  used  for 
further communication in any group oriented applications.   

indistinguishability,  and 

self-binding 

 
This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  II  presents 
related works, and evaluation of the related works. Section III 
presents  the  proposed  TCGA  scheme  and  TCGA  framework. 
Section  IV  presents  the  implementation  results,  security 
analysis, and the discussion. Finally, section V summarizes the 
paper with the future work.

In a group authentication [9], participants belonging to the 
same  group  are  authenticated.  It  is  many-to-many  type  of 
authentication,  which  is  more  suited  for  group  oriented  IoT 
applications  as  there  are  more  number  of  devices.  Group 
authentication  for  users  is  presented  in  [9],  which  is  t-secure, 
m-user, n-group Group Authentication Scheme (GAS): ((t, m, 
n) GAS), where t is a threshold of the proposed scheme. In [9], 
resources,  constrained  devices  are  not  considered.  Scalable, 
and  decentralized  group  authentication  protocol  for  vehicular 
communication  is  presented  in  [10].    Detail  security  analysis 
of the proposed scheme is not presented in [10]. Group-based 
handover authentication scheme for mobile WiMAX networks 
is presented in [11], where handover of security context takes 
place  at  the  each  mobility.  It  consists  of  point  multiplication 
operation  at  each  node  which  adds  extra  overheads.  Secure 
mutual  authentication  protocol  for  RFID  is  presented  in  [12].

Hash-based encryption adds more overhead to this scheme. In 
[13],  the  profile  based  authentication,  and  authorization  is 

 

discussed  without  implementation  details,  and  results.  A 
group-based negotiation in peer to peer system is presented in 
[14], but authors have failed to discuss the security analysis of 
the  proposed  scheme.  Resource  negotiation  language  is 
discussed  in  the  scope  of  this  paper  but,  its  applicability  to 
other ad-hoc networks is left unaddressed. A lightweight, and 
distributed  group  authentication  scheme  for  ad-hoc  network 
devices  is  presented  in  [15].  Performance  analysis  of  the 
proposed scheme is not discussed in [15].  

 
From  the  state  of  the  art,  it  must  be  however  noted  that 
existing group authentication schemes are not lightweight, and 
secure.  Also in the context of IoT, there is a need of scalable 
group  authentication  scheme  due 
large  number  of 
heterogeneous devices.

III.  Proposed TCGA Scheme 

In  [9],  the  author  has  achieved  group  authentication  by 
releasing token based on Shamir’s (t, n) secret sharing scheme. 
This  paper  extends  this  work  using  Paillier  Threshold 
Cryptography.    Proposed  TCGA  scheme  also  establishes  a 
secret  session  key  at  the  end  of  each  group  authentication 
which  can  be  used  for  group  application.  TCGA  scheme  is 
implemented in WI-FI environment.   

 

Figure 1: Group Authentication 

 

 
Initially,  let’s  consider  an  environment  where  we  have 
devices in two contexts as shown in above Part I of the Figure 
1.  Each  group  contains  a  set  of  devices  communicating  with 
each other using  shared secret key. There can be any number 
of  groups  each  having  its  specified  range  of  connectivity 
according  to  the  WI-FI  standard.  These  groups  can  even 
overlap with each other with many devices capable of being a 
part of more than one group. Part II in the Figure 1 depicts the 
state  of 
the  environment  when  a  member  has  group 
authenticated  with  a  group.  Now,  if  a  device  of  the  group  B, 
wants  to  communicate  with  any  device  in  the  group  A,  then 
device will initiate the handshake, thereby authenticating itself 
with the  group A. Eventually, only authenticated devices from 
the  group  B  will  have  the  secret  of  the  group  A.  Now  it  can 
communicate  with all the  members of the  group  A since it is 
group authenticated. On the other hand, all the devices of the 
group  B  except  the  authenticated  one  cannot  communicate 
with the group A devices. The head of the group is required to 
generate,  and  distribute  the  new  key  pairs  every  time  a  new 
member enters the group to maintain group key leakage, and it 
is  referred  as  Group  Authority  (GA)  in  this  paper.  TCGA 
comprises following five modules: 

 

1.  Key Distribution. 
2.  Key Updation. 

3.  Group Credits Generation. 
4.  Authentication Listener. 
5.  Message Decryptor. 

 

Algorithms  for  these  five  modules  are  presented  below. 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that  it  takes  O  (n) 
time  for ‘n’ devices  which is  linear time, and, hence efficient 
for 
large  number  of  devices.  Time  analysis  of  group 
authentication  is  polynomial  time  with  O  (n2)  which  is  fairly 
good time for group oriented applications in IoT.

1: GA <-- Key Distributor 
2: NewM <-- New Member 
3: Gcurr <-- The Group member wants to join 
4: START 
5:     if (REQUEST == JOIN) 
6:     if (groupListContains(Gcurr) &&  
        Pssword= = Gcurr.Password) 
7:     updateMemberList(IP[NewM]) 
8:     updateThreshold(n) 
9:     keys [] = KeyGen. PaillierThresholdKey (128, n, threshold,    
10:   randomNum( )) 
11:   for (k: Gcurr.groupMembers ) 
12:   Connect (Gcurr.groupMembers.i) 
13:   Send (Gcurr, key [k++]) 
14:    
15: 
16: END 
 

 else 
        Display ("ERROR") 

Time Analysis: n = Number of devices  
 
Recurrence relation can be written as:  

T (n) = T (n-1) + T (1)   
              = T (n-2) + 2*T (1) 
              = T (n-3) + 3*T (1) 
              ... 
              = T (n-k) + k*T (1), let’s put k = n-1 
        
        
  Hence T (n) = O (n)   

 T (n) = T (1) + n-1(T (1)) 
 T (n) = 2 + n*2 – 2 

 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that,  in  the 
proposed TCGA scheme, it takes O (n) time to distribute key 
amongst n devices. This shows that, even for large number of 
devices,  the  time  required  for  key  distribution  is  linear  and 
more appropriate for the scalable IoT.   
 
Algorithm 2 TCGA – Key Updation 
1: Gcurr <-- Current Group 
2: START 
3:     if (REQUEST == "UPDATE_KEY") 
4:     Update (Gcurr.set(PrivatePartKey) ,  
        Gcurr.set (GroupMemberList)) 
5: END 
 
Algorithm 3 TCGA – Group Credits Generation 
1: Gcurr <-- Current Group 
2: START 
3:      secret = Random (r) 
4       hash = MessageDigest ["SHA-512", secret] 
5:      GroupCred = Encrpyt ([secret, hash]_KPublicKey )

in the short time due to unbounded number of devices, and receipt of 
their  authentication  request  at  the  same  time.  Therefore,  secure,  and 
efficient  group  authentication,  and  authorization  scheme  is  required 
that  authenticates  a  group  of  devices  at  once  in  the  context  of 
resource  constrained  IoT.  This  paper  presents  novel  Threshold

IoT  which  verifies  authenticity  of  all  the  devices  taking  part  in  the 
group  communication.  This  paper  also  presents  TCGA  framework 
which  is  flexible  and  secure.  The  proposed  TCGA  scheme  is

TCGA  scheme  is  lightweight,  and  alleviates  the  effect  of  battery 
exhaustion attack. This paper also presents time analysis, and formal 
security  analysis  of  TCGA  scheme  which  shows  that  the  proposed 
TCGA scheme is safe from the replay, man-in-the-middle attack, and 
is scalable in nature.

I.  Introduction 

The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  refers  to  the  network 
interconnection  of  everyday  devices.  An  IoT  is  a  world-wide 
network  of  inter-connected  devices  uniquely  addressable, 
based  on  a  standard  communication  protocol.  In  the  IoT, 
people are surrounded by different types of computing devices 
which are billion in number, varied in size, and capabilities to 
communicate  with  each  other.  Devices  are  having  limited 
capabilities, and computing resources which range from Radio 
Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  tags  to  embedded  devices, 
PDA, and sensor nodes. IoT integrates the physical world with 
the  information  world,  and  provides  ambient  services,  and 
applications. 
IoT  networks  allow  users,  devices,  and 
applications  in  different  physical  locations  to  communicate 
seamlessly  with  one  another.  In  brief,  the  IoT  facilitates 
different  communication  patterns  like:  user-to-user,  user-to-
device,  device-to-device,  and  devices-to-user.  However,  the 
decentralized, and distributed nature of the IoT face challenges 
in  authentication,  access  control,  and  Identity  Management 
(IdM)  [2,  3,  and  4].  There  are  various  challenges  to  design 
security 
like  constraints,  and 
heterogeneous  communication,  resource  constraints,  and 
distributed nature.

IdM  of  devices  in  the  IoT  is  one  of  the  important 
challenges,  and  can  be  achieved  by  efficient  authentication 
schemes which are simple, secure, and lightweight. In the IoT, 
there  are  unbounded  numbers  of  heterogeneous  devices 
talking  to  each  other.  Each  device  should  not  be  able  to 
authenticate  during  the  short  time.  Due  to  the  scale  of 

devices 

to

individual 

economics,  more  than  hundreds  of  devices  may  request 
authentication  approval  at  the  same  time.  To  this  purpose, 
lightweight, scalable, and secure group authentication scheme 
is required which will authenticate groups of devices, and not 
the 
group 
communication.  This  paper  proposes  a  group  authentication 
scheme  using  Paillier  Threshold  Cryptography  [5,  6,  and  7] 
which  is  a  public  key  variant  of  the  (t,  n)  threshold  scheme 
where t is threshold, and n is number of group members. The 
Paillier  Cryptosystem  helps 
to  achieve  homomorphic 
properties, which is most suited for privacy preservation in the 
IoT  applications.  It  is  probabilistic  asymmetric  public  key 
encryption  system  which  uses  randomness  in  an  encryption 
algorithm,  so  that  when  encrypting  the  same,  plaintext  for 
several  times.  This  will  yield  different  cipher  texts.  The  key 
properties  of  Paillier  Cryptosystem  include  homomorphic 
addition, 
[5,  8]. 
Essentially,  the  Paillier  Cryptosystem  comprises  of  three 
algorithms:  key  generation,  encryption  and  decryption.    The 
proposed  TCGA  scheme  is  used  to  verify  the  authenticity  of 
all  the  members  taking  part  in  a  group  oriented  application. 
The  scheme  also  helps  in  establishing  a  shared  secret  key 
between  the  members  of  the  group  which  can  be  used  for 
further communication in any group oriented applications.

In a group authentication [9], participants belonging to the 
same  group  are  authenticated.  It  is  many-to-many  type  of 
authentication,  which  is  more  suited  for  group  oriented  IoT 
applications  as  there  are  more  number  of  devices.  Group 
authentication  for  users  is  presented  in  [9],  which  is  t-secure, 
m-user, n-group Group Authentication Scheme (GAS): ((t, m, 
n) GAS), where t is a threshold of the proposed scheme. In [9], 
resources,  constrained  devices  are  not  considered.  Scalable, 
and  decentralized  group  authentication  protocol  for  vehicular 
communication  is  presented  in  [10].    Detail  security  analysis 
of the proposed scheme is not presented in [10]. Group-based 
handover authentication scheme for mobile WiMAX networks 
is presented in [11], where handover of security context takes 
place  at  the  each  mobility.  It  consists  of  point  multiplication 
operation  at  each  node  which  adds  extra  overheads.  Secure 
mutual  authentication  protocol  for  RFID  is  presented  in  [12]. 
Hash-based encryption adds more overhead to this scheme. In 
[13],  the  profile  based  authentication,  and  authorization  is 

 

discussed  without  implementation  details,  and  results.  A 
group-based negotiation in peer to peer system is presented in 
[14], but authors have failed to discuss the security analysis of 
the  proposed  scheme.  Resource  negotiation  language  is 
discussed  in  the  scope  of  this  paper  but,  its  applicability  to 
other ad-hoc networks is left unaddressed. A lightweight, and 
distributed  group  authentication  scheme  for  ad-hoc  network 
devices  is  presented  in  [15].  Performance  analysis  of  the 
proposed scheme is not discussed in [15].  

 
From  the  state  of  the  art,  it  must  be  however  noted  that 
existing group authentication schemes are not lightweight, and 
secure.  Also in the context of IoT, there is a need of scalable 
group  authentication  scheme  due 
large  number  of 
heterogeneous devices.

III.  Proposed TCGA Scheme 

In  [9],  the  author  has  achieved  group  authentication  by 
releasing token based on Shamir’s (t, n) secret sharing scheme. 
This  paper  extends  this  work  using  Paillier  Threshold 
Cryptography.    Proposed  TCGA  scheme  also  establishes  a 
secret  session  key  at  the  end  of  each  group  authentication 
which  can  be  used  for  group  application.  TCGA  scheme  is 
implemented in WI-FI environment.   

 

Figure 1: Group Authentication 

 

 
Initially,  let’s  consider  an  environment  where  we  have 
devices in two contexts as shown in above Part I of the Figure 
1.  Each  group  contains  a  set  of  devices  communicating  with 
each other using  shared secret key. There can be any number 
of  groups  each  having  its  specified  range  of  connectivity 
according  to  the  WI-FI  standard.  These  groups  can  even 
overlap with each other with many devices capable of being a 
part of more than one group. Part II in the Figure 1 depicts the 
state  of 
the  environment  when  a  member  has  group 
authenticated  with  a  group.  Now,  if  a  device  of  the  group  B, 
wants  to  communicate  with  any  device  in  the  group  A,  then 
device will initiate the handshake, thereby authenticating itself 
with the  group A. Eventually, only authenticated devices from 
the  group  B  will  have  the  secret  of  the  group  A.  Now  it  can 
communicate  with all the  members of the  group  A since it is 
group authenticated. On the other hand, all the devices of the 
group  B  except  the  authenticated  one  cannot  communicate 
with the group A devices. The head of the group is required to 
generate,  and  distribute  the  new  key  pairs  every  time  a  new 
member enters the group to maintain group key leakage, and it 
is  referred  as  Group  Authority  (GA)  in  this  paper.  TCGA 
comprises following five modules: 

 

1.  Key Distribution. 
2.  Key Updation. 

3.  Group Credits Generation. 
4.  Authentication Listener. 
5.  Message Decryptor. 

 

Algorithms  for  these  five  modules  are  presented  below. 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that  it  takes  O  (n) 
time  for ‘n’ devices  which is  linear time, and, hence efficient 
for 
large  number  of  devices.  Time  analysis  of  group 
authentication  is  polynomial  time  with  O  (n2)  which  is  fairly 
good time for group oriented applications in IoT.

Time Analysis: n = Number of devices  
 
Recurrence relation can be written as:  

T (n) = T (n-1) + T (1)   
              = T (n-2) + 2*T (1) 
              = T (n-3) + 3*T (1) 
              ... 
              = T (n-k) + k*T (1), let’s put k = n-1 
        
        
  Hence T (n) = O (n)   

 T (n) = T (1) + n-1(T (1)) 
 T (n) = 2 + n*2 – 2 

 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that,  in  the 
proposed TCGA scheme, it takes O (n) time to distribute key 
amongst n devices. This shows that, even for large number of 
devices,  the  time  required  for  key  distribution  is  linear  and 
more appropriate for the scalable IoT.

Time Analysis: Group Authentication  
 
Recurrence relation can be written as: 
 
              T (n) = T (n-1) + O (n)   
              = T (n-2) + O (n-1)) + O (n) 
              = T (n-2) + O (n-1) + O (n) 
              = T (n-3) + O (n-2) + O (n-1) + O (n) 
                 ... 
              = T (1) + O (2) + ... + O (n-1) + O (n) 
              = O (1 + 2 + ... + n-1 + n) 
              = O (n2) 
 

Time  analysis  of  the  proposed TCGA  scheme  shows  that, 
to authenticate n devices to each other from different group, it 
takes  O  (n2)  time.  O  (n2)  represents  polynomial  time 
complexity and for even large number of devices, it performs 
better.  This  time  is  also  logarithmic  time  as  the  running  time 
of this algorithm is proportional to the square of input size. To 
summarize,  detailed  time  analysis  of  the  proposed  TCGA 
scheme shows that it is time efficient and, most suited for the 
IoT consisting of unbounded number of devices. 

 
TCGA  scheme  uses  a  variant  of 

the  public-key 
cryptography  known as Threshold Cryptography to develop a 
lightweight  group  authentication  mechanism  suitable  for  ad-
hoc devices. Group authentication aims at removing the  need 
to  establish  a  secure  connection  between  all  the  devices  in  a 

particular  group  every  time  they  want  to  communicate,  and 
thereby  reducing  the  number  of  handshakes  done  before  the 
communication  starts.  This  reduced  overhead  will  help  in 
conserving  battery  power  as  well  as  ensures  that  minimum 
numbers of resources are used. This provision of joining new 
member  to  the  group,  and  updating  threshold  value  for  new 
device,  and  generating  key  using  Threshold  Cryptography  is 
the  task  of  key  distribution  module.  Key  Updation  module 
generates public/ private key pairs for GA. The other members 
of the group change their private part keys using this module. 
The  Message  Decryptor  module  combines  all  the  partially 
decrypted  messages, and produces final a decrypted  message. 
The Authentication Listener  module listens for authentication 
request  if  any,  and  accepts  the  Partially  Decrypted  Message 
(PDM) from all the members.  TCGA works in two phases:

The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  refers  to  the  network 
interconnection  of  everyday  devices.  An  IoT  is  a  world-wide

of  groups  each  having  its  specified  range  of  connectivity 
according  to  the  WI-FI  standard.  These  groups  can  even 
overlap with each other with many devices capable of being a 
part of more than one group. Part II in the Figure 1 depicts the 
state  of 
the  environment  when  a  member  has  group 
authenticated  with  a  group.  Now,  if  a  device  of  the  group  B, 
wants  to  communicate  with  any  device  in  the  group  A,  then 
device will initiate the handshake, thereby authenticating itself 
with the  group A. Eventually, only authenticated devices from 
the  group  B  will  have  the  secret  of  the  group  A.  Now  it  can 
communicate  with all the  members of the  group  A since it is 
group authenticated. On the other hand, all the devices of the 
group  B  except  the  authenticated  one  cannot  communicate 
with the group A devices. The head of the group is required to 
generate,  and  distribute  the  new  key  pairs  every  time  a  new 
member enters the group to maintain group key leakage, and it 
is  referred  as  Group  Authority  (GA)  in  this  paper.  TCGA 
comprises following five modules: 

 

1.  Key Distribution. 
2.  Key Updation. 

3.  Group Credits Generation. 
4.  Authentication Listener. 
5.  Message Decryptor. 

 

Algorithms  for  these  five  modules  are  presented  below. 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that  it  takes  O  (n) 
time  for ‘n’ devices  which is  linear time, and, hence efficient 
for 
large  number  of  devices.  Time  analysis  of  group 
authentication  is  polynomial  time  with  O  (n2)  which  is  fairly 
good time for group oriented applications in IoT.

Recurrence relation can be written as:  

T (n) = T (n-1) + T (1)   
              = T (n-2) + 2*T (1) 
              = T (n-3) + 3*T (1) 
              ... 
              = T (n-k) + k*T (1), let’s put k = n-1 
        
        
  Hence T (n) = O (n)   

 T (n) = T (1) + n-1(T (1)) 
 T (n) = 2 + n*2 – 2 

 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that,  in  the 
proposed TCGA scheme, it takes O (n) time to distribute key 
amongst n devices. This shows that, even for large number of 
devices,  the  time  required  for  key  distribution  is  linear  and 
more appropriate for the scalable IoT.

Time Analysis: Group Authentication  
 
Recurrence relation can be written as: 
 
              T (n) = T (n-1) + O (n)   
              = T (n-2) + O (n-1)) + O (n) 
              = T (n-2) + O (n-1) + O (n) 
              = T (n-3) + O (n-2) + O (n-1) + O (n) 
                 ... 
              = T (1) + O (2) + ... + O (n-1) + O (n) 
              = O (1 + 2 + ... + n-1 + n) 
              = O (n2) 
 

Time  analysis  of  the  proposed TCGA  scheme  shows  that, 
to authenticate n devices to each other from different group, it 
takes  O  (n2)  time.  O  (n2)  represents  polynomial  time 
complexity and for even large number of devices, it performs 
better.  This  time  is  also  logarithmic  time  as  the  running  time 
of this algorithm is proportional to the square of input size. To 
summarize,  detailed  time  analysis  of  the  proposed  TCGA 
scheme shows that it is time efficient and, most suited for the 
IoT consisting of unbounded number of devices. 

 
TCGA  scheme  uses  a  variant  of 

the  public-key 
cryptography  known as Threshold Cryptography to develop a 
lightweight  group  authentication  mechanism  suitable  for  ad-
hoc devices. Group authentication aims at removing the  need 
to  establish  a  secure  connection  between  all  the  devices  in  a 

particular  group  every  time  they  want  to  communicate,  and 
thereby  reducing  the  number  of  handshakes  done  before  the 
communication  starts.  This  reduced  overhead  will  help  in 
conserving  battery  power  as  well  as  ensures  that  minimum 
numbers of resources are used. This provision of joining new 
member  to  the  group,  and  updating  threshold  value  for  new 
device,  and  generating  key  using  Threshold  Cryptography  is 
the  task  of  key  distribution  module.  Key  Updation  module 
generates public/ private key pairs for GA. The other members 
of the group change their private part keys using this module. 
The  Message  Decryptor  module  combines  all  the  partially 
decrypted  messages, and produces final a decrypted  message. 
The Authentication Listener  module listens for authentication 
request  if  any,  and  accepts  the  Partially  Decrypted  Message 
(PDM) from all the members.  TCGA works in two phases: 

Figure 2: TCGA Activity Diagram 

 

 

Complete  TCGA  scheme  is  depicted  in  the  Figure  2  with 
an  activity  diagram  which  describes  the  logical  processes,  or 
functions  where  each  process  describes  a  sequence  of  tasks, 
and decisions that govern when, and how they are performed. 

 
a.  Pre-Authentication Phase 

 

In this phase, the GA of the group, who creates the group, 
is responsible for generating a public key KPu  (G) and multiple 
private  keys  KPr1  (G)…..KPrn  (G)  using  Paillier  Threshold 
Cryptosystem  depending  upon  the  number  of  members  (n)  in 
the  group,  and  the  threshold  value  t.  Private  keys  K  Pr1(G)…..K 
Prn(G) are then distributed by the GA among all the members of 
the group. When a new member joins the group, the threshold 
value  is  changed  appropriately,  and  keys  are  generated,  and 
distributed again. This threshold value changes dynamically as 
new  members  join  so  that  the  high  level  of  security  is 
maintained. 
 

b.  Group Authentication Phase  

 

If a group activity needs to be started, group authentication 
needs  to  be  performed  as  a  pre-requisite  to  check  if  all  the 
members  M1…Mm  (where  m<=n)  are  part  of  the  group.  The 
GA chooses a pseudo-random number as a session secret [SS] 
key  which  is  going  to  be  shared  with  all  the  members  of  the 
group once the group authentication is done. This is encrypted 
using  the  public  key  [KPu]  of  the  group,  and  sent  to  all  the 
members of the group. The hash of the session secret H [SS] is 
also sent along with it. 

Message = {[SS] KPu, H [SS]} 

Each  of  the  members,  upon  reception  of  this  message, 
applies their private key part to decrypt it, giving them a PDM. 
Each  device  has  a  unique  PDM  corresponding  to  a  different 
part key.  

 

PDM = Decrypt (Message, PrivatePartKey) 

Each  device  then  sends  this  PDM  to  every  member 
including  the  GA.  All  the  devices  wait  to  combine  all  the 
PDMs until n-1 PDMs are received. Each device combines all 
the PDMs so as to get the decrypted session key.  

 
Session Key = Combine (PDM1, PDM2… PDMm) 
 
If combining all PDM shares is successful, the session key 
is obtained and it proves that all the members are a part of that 
group  only.  The  Decrypted  session  key  is  hashed  to  get  H’ 
[SS] and checked with the one sent by the GA. If H’ [SS] = H 
[SS], then authentication is successful, and session key [SS] is 
obtained.  This  comparison  is  made  to  check  whether  the 
session key obtained is valid. The session key [SS] obtained in 
the  last  step  can  be  used  for  further  communication  between 
the  devices  which  can  be  carried  out  using  Symmetric  Key 
Encryption.  If  combining  all  PDM  shares  is  unsuccessful 
means that there is at least one non-member in the group, and, 
hence the activity cannot be initiated, and group authentication 
fails.  Further  individual  authentication  needs  to  be  done  to 
identify the non-member in the group. 
 

To summarize, when any particular member wants to start 
a  group  activity,  it  send  a  request  to  the  current  GA.  On 
reception  of  the  request,  the  GA  generates  a  session  secret 
which is going to be shared by all the members of that group. 
This session secret is then encrypted with the public key of the 
group.  This  provides  the  required  security  as  it  can  only  be 
decrypted by the complete private  key.  A Hash  map  function 
is  applied  to  the  session  secret  which  is  going  to  be  used  in 
further  steps  to  prove  the  integrity  of  this  message.  It  is  sent 
along  with  the  encrypted  session  secret  in  a  single  message.  
This message is sent to all the members of the group. All the 
devices  then  use  their  own  part  private  keys  to  decrypt  this 
message  which  gives  them  a  PDM  which  is  not  the  final 
session secret. Now it sends this PDM to each member in the 
group. Until n-1 PDMs are received each of the devices waits. 
All the devices then try to combine all of the shares which will 
ultimately  give  them  the  final  session  secret.  If  successful, 
means that all the PDMs received are by the legitimate group 
members  only,  and,  hence  the  group  authentication  succeeds. 
The group activity can then be started using the session secret 
for further communication. If unsuccessful, means that there is 
at least one device which is using a fake part private key and 
hence the partial decryption  generated by  him is not genuine. 
Therefore, upon trying to combine all  the  shares it  was result 
in failure. This means that group authentication fails, and there 
is a need to restart the process.

Abstract:    Internet  of  things  (IoT)  is  an  emerging  paradigm 
where  the  devices  around  us  (persistent  and  non-persistent)  are 
connected  to  each  other  to  provide  seamless  communication,  and 
contextual services.  In the IoT, each device cannot be authenticated 
in the short time due to unbounded number of devices, and receipt of 
their  authentication  request  at  the  same  time.  Therefore,  secure,  and 
efficient  group  authentication,  and  authorization  scheme  is  required 
that  authenticates  a  group  of  devices  at  once  in  the  context  of 
resource  constrained  IoT.  This  paper  presents  novel  Threshold 
Cryptography-based  Group  Authentication  (TCGA)  scheme  for  the 
IoT  which  verifies  authenticity  of  all  the  devices  taking  part  in  the 
group  communication.  This  paper  also  presents  TCGA  framework 
which  is  flexible  and  secure.  The  proposed  TCGA  scheme  is 
implemented  for  WI-FI  environment,  and  the  result  shows  that 
TCGA  scheme  is  lightweight,  and  alleviates  the  effect  of  battery 
exhaustion attack. This paper also presents time analysis, and formal 
security  analysis  of  TCGA  scheme  which  shows  that  the  proposed 
TCGA scheme is safe from the replay, man-in-the-middle attack, and 
is scalable in nature.

I.  Introduction 

The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  refers  to  the  network 
interconnection  of  everyday  devices.  An  IoT  is  a  world-wide 
network  of  inter-connected  devices  uniquely  addressable, 
based  on  a  standard  communication  protocol.  In  the  IoT, 
people are surrounded by different types of computing devices 
which are billion in number, varied in size, and capabilities to 
communicate  with  each  other.  Devices  are  having  limited 
capabilities, and computing resources which range from Radio 
Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  tags  to  embedded  devices, 
PDA, and sensor nodes. IoT integrates the physical world with 
the  information  world,  and  provides  ambient  services,  and 
applications. 
IoT  networks  allow  users,  devices,  and 
applications  in  different  physical  locations  to  communicate 
seamlessly  with  one  another.  In  brief,  the  IoT  facilitates 
different  communication  patterns  like:  user-to-user,  user-to-
device,  device-to-device,  and  devices-to-user.  However,  the 
decentralized, and distributed nature of the IoT face challenges 
in  authentication,  access  control,  and  Identity  Management 
(IdM)  [2,  3,  and  4].  There  are  various  challenges  to  design 
security 
like  constraints,  and 
heterogeneous  communication,  resource  constraints,  and 
distributed nature.

IdM  of  devices  in  the  IoT  is  one  of  the  important 
challenges,  and  can  be  achieved  by  efficient  authentication 
schemes which are simple, secure, and lightweight. In the IoT, 
there  are  unbounded  numbers  of  heterogeneous  devices 
talking  to  each  other.  Each  device  should  not  be  able  to 
authenticate  during  the  short  time.  Due  to  the  scale  of 

devices

individual 

economics,  more  than  hundreds  of  devices  may  request 
authentication  approval  at  the  same  time.  To  this  purpose, 
lightweight, scalable, and secure group authentication scheme 
is required which will authenticate groups of devices, and not 
the 
group 
communication.  This  paper  proposes  a  group  authentication 
scheme  using  Paillier  Threshold  Cryptography  [5,  6,  and  7] 
which  is  a  public  key  variant  of  the  (t,  n)  threshold  scheme 
where t is threshold, and n is number of group members. The 
Paillier  Cryptosystem  helps 
to  achieve  homomorphic 
properties, which is most suited for privacy preservation in the 
IoT  applications.  It  is  probabilistic  asymmetric  public  key 
encryption  system  which  uses  randomness  in  an  encryption 
algorithm,  so  that  when  encrypting  the  same,  plaintext  for 
several  times.  This  will  yield  different  cipher  texts.  The  key 
properties  of  Paillier  Cryptosystem  include  homomorphic 
addition, 
[5,  8]. 
Essentially,  the  Paillier  Cryptosystem  comprises  of  three 
algorithms:  key  generation,  encryption  and  decryption.    The 
proposed  TCGA  scheme  is  used  to  verify  the  authenticity  of 
all  the  members  taking  part  in  a  group  oriented  application. 
The  scheme  also  helps  in  establishing  a  shared  secret  key 
between  the  members  of  the  group  which  can  be  used  for 
further communication in any group oriented applications.

self-binding 

 
This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  II  presents 
related works, and evaluation of the related works. Section III 
presents  the  proposed  TCGA  scheme  and  TCGA  framework. 
Section  IV  presents  the  implementation  results,  security 
analysis, and the discussion. Finally, section V summarizes the 
paper with the future work. 

 

II.  Related Works 

In a group authentication [9], participants belonging to the 
same  group  are  authenticated.  It  is  many-to-many  type  of 
authentication,  which  is  more  suited  for  group  oriented  IoT 
applications  as  there  are  more  number  of  devices.  Group 
authentication  for  users  is  presented  in  [9],  which  is  t-secure, 
m-user, n-group Group Authentication Scheme (GAS): ((t, m, 
n) GAS), where t is a threshold of the proposed scheme. In [9], 
resources,  constrained  devices  are  not  considered.  Scalable, 
and  decentralized  group  authentication  protocol  for  vehicular 
communication  is  presented  in  [10].    Detail  security  analysis 
of the proposed scheme is not presented in [10]. Group-based 
handover authentication scheme for mobile WiMAX networks 
is presented in [11], where handover of security context takes 
place  at  the  each  mobility.  It  consists  of  point  multiplication 
operation  at  each  node  which  adds  extra  overheads.  Secure 
mutual  authentication  protocol  for  RFID  is  presented  in  [12]. 
Hash-based encryption adds more overhead to this scheme. In 
[13],  the  profile  based  authentication,  and  authorization  is 

 

discussed  without  implementation  details,  and  results.  A 
group-based negotiation in peer to peer system is presented in 
[14], but authors have failed to discuss the security analysis of 
the  proposed  scheme.  Resource  negotiation  language  is 
discussed  in  the  scope  of  this  paper  but,  its  applicability  to 
other ad-hoc networks is left unaddressed. A lightweight, and 
distributed  group  authentication  scheme  for  ad-hoc  network 
devices  is  presented  in  [15].  Performance  analysis  of  the 
proposed scheme is not discussed in [15].  

 
From  the  state  of  the  art,  it  must  be  however  noted  that 
existing group authentication schemes are not lightweight, and 
secure.  Also in the context of IoT, there is a need of scalable 
group  authentication  scheme  due 
large  number  of 
heterogeneous devices.

III.  Proposed TCGA Scheme 

In  [9],  the  author  has  achieved  group  authentication  by 
releasing token based on Shamir’s (t, n) secret sharing scheme. 
This  paper  extends  this  work  using  Paillier  Threshold 
Cryptography.    Proposed  TCGA  scheme  also  establishes  a 
secret  session  key  at  the  end  of  each  group  authentication 
which  can  be  used  for  group  application.  TCGA  scheme  is 
implemented in WI-FI environment.   

 

Figure 1: Group Authentication 

 

 
Initially,  let’s  consider  an  environment  where  we  have 
devices in two contexts as shown in above Part I of the Figure 
1.  Each  group  contains  a  set  of  devices  communicating  with 
each other using  shared secret key. There can be any number 
of  groups  each  having  its  specified  range  of  connectivity 
according  to  the  WI-FI  standard.  These  groups  can  even 
overlap with each other with many devices capable of being a 
part of more than one group. Part II in the Figure 1 depicts the 
state  of 
the  environment  when  a  member  has  group 
authenticated  with  a  group.  Now,  if  a  device  of  the  group  B, 
wants  to  communicate  with  any  device  in  the  group  A,  then 
device will initiate the handshake, thereby authenticating itself 
with the  group A. Eventually, only authenticated devices from 
the  group  B  will  have  the  secret  of  the  group  A.  Now  it  can 
communicate  with all the  members of the  group  A since it is 
group authenticated. On the other hand, all the devices of the 
group  B  except  the  authenticated  one  cannot  communicate 
with the group A devices. The head of the group is required to 
generate,  and  distribute  the  new  key  pairs  every  time  a  new 
member enters the group to maintain group key leakage, and it 
is  referred  as  Group  Authority  (GA)  in  this  paper.  TCGA 
comprises following five modules: 

 

1.  Key Distribution. 
2.  Key Updation. 

3.  Group Credits Generation. 
4.  Authentication Listener. 
5.  Message Decryptor. 

 

Algorithms  for  these  five  modules  are  presented  below. 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that  it  takes  O  (n) 
time  for ‘n’ devices  which is  linear time, and, hence efficient 
for 
large  number  of  devices.  Time  analysis  of  group 
authentication  is  polynomial  time  with  O  (n2)  which  is  fairly 
good time for group oriented applications in IoT.

Recurrence relation can be written as:  

T (n) = T (n-1) + T (1)   
              = T (n-2) + 2*T (1) 
              = T (n-3) + 3*T (1)

  Hence T (n) = O (n)   

 T (n) = T (1) + n-1(T (1)) 
 T (n) = 2 + n*2 – 2 

 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that,  in  the 
proposed TCGA scheme, it takes O (n) time to distribute key 
amongst n devices. This shows that, even for large number of 
devices,  the  time  required  for  key  distribution  is  linear  and 
more appropriate for the scalable IoT.

Time Analysis: Group Authentication  
 
Recurrence relation can be written as: 
 
              T (n) = T (n-1) + O (n)   
              = T (n-2) + O (n-1)) + O (n) 
              = T (n-2) + O (n-1) + O (n) 
              = T (n-3) + O (n-2) + O (n-1) + O (n) 
                 ... 
              = T (1) + O (2) + ... + O (n-1) + O (n) 
              = O (1 + 2 + ... + n-1 + n) 
              = O (n2) 
 

Time  analysis  of  the  proposed TCGA  scheme  shows  that, 
to authenticate n devices to each other from different group, it 
takes  O  (n2)  time.  O  (n2)  represents  polynomial  time 
complexity and for even large number of devices, it performs 
better.  This  time  is  also  logarithmic  time  as  the  running  time 
of this algorithm is proportional to the square of input size. To 
summarize,  detailed  time  analysis  of  the  proposed  TCGA 
scheme shows that it is time efficient and, most suited for the 
IoT consisting of unbounded number of devices. 

 
TCGA  scheme  uses  a  variant  of 

the  public-key 
cryptography  known as Threshold Cryptography to develop a 
lightweight  group  authentication  mechanism  suitable  for  ad-
hoc devices. Group authentication aims at removing the  need 
to  establish  a  secure  connection  between  all  the  devices  in  a 

particular  group  every  time  they  want  to  communicate,  and 
thereby  reducing  the  number  of  handshakes  done  before  the 
communication  starts.  This  reduced  overhead  will  help  in 
conserving  battery  power  as  well  as  ensures  that  minimum 
numbers of resources are used. This provision of joining new 
member  to  the  group,  and  updating  threshold  value  for  new 
device,  and  generating  key  using  Threshold  Cryptography  is 
the  task  of  key  distribution  module.  Key  Updation  module 
generates public/ private key pairs for GA. The other members 
of the group change their private part keys using this module. 
The  Message  Decryptor  module  combines  all  the  partially 
decrypted  messages, and produces final a decrypted  message. 
The Authentication Listener  module listens for authentication 
request  if  any,  and  accepts  the  Partially  Decrypted  Message 
(PDM) from all the members.  TCGA works in two phases: 

Figure 2: TCGA Activity Diagram 

 

 

Complete  TCGA  scheme  is  depicted  in  the  Figure  2  with 
an  activity  diagram  which  describes  the  logical  processes,  or 
functions  where  each  process  describes  a  sequence  of  tasks, 
and decisions that govern when, and how they are performed. 

 
a.  Pre-Authentication Phase 

 

In this phase, the GA of the group, who creates the group, 
is responsible for generating a public key KPu  (G) and multiple 
private  keys  KPr1  (G)…..KPrn  (G)  using  Paillier  Threshold 
Cryptosystem  depending  upon  the  number  of  members  (n)  in 
the  group,  and  the  threshold  value  t.  Private  keys  K  Pr1(G)…..K 
Prn(G) are then distributed by the GA among all the members of 
the group. When a new member joins the group, the threshold 
value  is  changed  appropriately,  and  keys  are  generated,  and 
distributed again. This threshold value changes dynamically as 
new  members  join  so  that  the  high  level  of  security  is 
maintained. 
 

b.  Group Authentication Phase  

 

If a group activity needs to be started, group authentication 
needs  to  be  performed  as  a  pre-requisite  to  check  if  all  the 
members  M1…Mm  (where  m<=n)  are  part  of  the  group.  The 
GA chooses a pseudo-random number as a session secret [SS] 
key  which  is  going  to  be  shared  with  all  the  members  of  the 
group once the group authentication is done. This is encrypted 
using  the  public  key  [KPu]  of  the  group,  and  sent  to  all  the 
members of the group. The hash of the session secret H [SS] is 
also sent along with it. 

Message = {[SS] KPu, H [SS]} 

Each  of  the  members,  upon  reception  of  this  message, 
applies their private key part to decrypt it, giving them a PDM. 
Each  device  has  a  unique  PDM  corresponding  to  a  different 
part key.  

 

PDM = Decrypt (Message, PrivatePartKey) 

Each  device  then  sends  this  PDM  to  every  member 
including  the  GA.  All  the  devices  wait  to  combine  all  the 
PDMs until n-1 PDMs are received. Each device combines all 
the PDMs so as to get the decrypted session key.  

 
Session Key = Combine (PDM1, PDM2… PDMm) 
 
If combining all PDM shares is successful, the session key 
is obtained and it proves that all the members are a part of that 
group  only.  The  Decrypted  session  key  is  hashed  to  get  H’ 
[SS] and checked with the one sent by the GA. If H’ [SS] = H 
[SS], then authentication is successful, and session key [SS] is 
obtained.  This  comparison  is  made  to  check  whether  the 
session key obtained is valid. The session key [SS] obtained in 
the  last  step  can  be  used  for  further  communication  between 
the  devices  which  can  be  carried  out  using  Symmetric  Key 
Encryption.  If  combining  all  PDM  shares  is  unsuccessful 
means that there is at least one non-member in the group, and, 
hence the activity cannot be initiated, and group authentication 
fails.  Further  individual  authentication  needs  to  be  done  to 
identify the non-member in the group. 
 

To summarize, when any particular member wants to start 
a  group  activity,  it  send  a  request  to  the  current  GA.  On 
reception  of  the  request,  the  GA  generates  a  session  secret 
which is going to be shared by all the members of that group. 
This session secret is then encrypted with the public key of the 
group.  This  provides  the  required  security  as  it  can  only  be 
decrypted by the complete private  key.  A Hash  map  function 
is  applied  to  the  session  secret  which  is  going  to  be  used  in 
further  steps  to  prove  the  integrity  of  this  message.  It  is  sent 
along  with  the  encrypted  session  secret  in  a  single  message.  
This message is sent to all the members of the group. All the 
devices  then  use  their  own  part  private  keys  to  decrypt  this 
message  which  gives  them  a  PDM  which  is  not  the  final 
session secret. Now it sends this PDM to each member in the 
group. Until n-1 PDMs are received each of the devices waits. 
All the devices then try to combine all of the shares which will 
ultimately  give  them  the  final  session  secret.  If  successful, 
means that all the PDMs received are by the legitimate group 
members  only,  and,  hence  the  group  authentication  succeeds. 
The group activity can then be started using the session secret 
for further communication. If unsuccessful, means that there is 
at least one device which is using a fake part private key and 
hence the partial decryption  generated by  him is not genuine. 
Therefore, upon trying to combine all  the  shares it  was result 
in failure. This means that group authentication fails, and there 
is a need to restart the process. 
 

Figure 3: Proposed TCGA Framework 

 

 

•  Proposed TCGA Framework 
 
In  the  IoT  communication,  there  are  devices  belonging  to 
same group or different group communicating to each other in 
distributed  manner.  When  devices  of 
the  same  group 
communicate  with  each  other,  there  is  some  amount  of  trust 
available between them. But when the devices of the different 
group communicate to each other, proposed TCGA scheme is 
required.  Proposed  TCGA  framework  is  presented  in  the 
Figure  3.  Framework  depicts  the  major  components  of 
authentication  process.  In  the  IoT  applications  like  banking, 
utilities,  agriculture  and  healthcare,  authentication  is  a  major 

 

concern.  When  the  devices  belonging  to  different  groups 
communicate to each other through Internet, TCGA performs 
key distribution, key updation, message decryption and finally 
group authentication in order to authenticate each other.  
 

The security analysis of the proposed TCGA framework is 
given  below.  Security  analysis  shows  that  proposed  TCGA 
framework 
realizes  many-to-many 
authentication and secure in distributed environment.

IV.  Results and Discussion 

TCGA  scheme  is  implemented  for  WI-FI  using  laptop 
devices.  All  the  devices  communicate  with  each  other  with 
respect  to  their  individual  group.  Implementation  results  are 
discussed below. 

 

Implementation Results: 

• 
 
Working  of  TCGA  shows  that,  generating  session  secret, 
encryption,  and  hashing  take  place  at  GA.  In  this  paper, 
TCGA  scheme  is  compared  with  the  group  authentication 
scheme presented in [9] in terms of the number of handshake 
between  GA,  and  device  to  device.  Number  of  handshakes 
between  communicating  entities  and  the  computation  at  the 
respective  entity  is  directly  related  to  the  computational 
overhead of the authentication scheme. In the TCGA scheme, 
the number of handshakes between devices, and GA are three 
which include request for the session secret, sending a reply to 
the device comprising of (SS, Kpu (G), H [SS], and finally the 
reply 
successful 
authentication,  or  failure.  In  the  scheme  presented  in  [9],  the 
number  of  handshakes  between  GA,  and  communicating 
entity  (user)  are  four  which  includes  all  user  registration, 
sending  private  token  to  each  user,  GA  assisted  group 
authentication,  and  the  result  of  authentication  to  GA.  In 
TCGA scheme, three types of computation takes place at GA 
which  includes  generation  of  session  secret,  encryption,  and 
hash creation.

Figure 4: Number of Devices Vs Group Authentication Time 

 

 
A series of three measurements have been taken to find the 
group authentication time in seconds by increasing the number 
of  devices  from  two  to  ten.  Figure  4  shows  that,  with  the 
increase  in  the  number  of  devices,  there  is  no  significant 
change in the authentication time. This result shows that, even 
the  numbers  of  devices  are  increased  at  a  faster  rate;  there  is 
no  increase  in  the  authentication  time  at  the  same  rate.  This 
shows that TCGA scheme is scalable, and best suited for IoT 
consisting of unbound number of devices.  
 

 
In  [9],  computations  takes  place  at  GA  includes  selecting 
random  polynomial  of  degree  t-1,  computing  n  tokens,  token 
distribution to all group members, and the selection of secret. 
Hence,  there  are  four  different  types  of  computation  taking 
place  at  GA  in  this  case.  Table  I  shows  the  comparison  of 
TCGA  scheme  with  the  scheme  proposed  in  [9]  for  different 
comparative parameters.  

 
The  proposed  TCGA  scheme  is  implemented  for  WI-FI 
devices  using  laptop  devices  of  the  same  configuration  in 
order to compare the computational time. Computational time 
is  measured  at  GA  for  authenticating  one  device,  and  the 
average of three measurements is taken to avoid the variation 
caused by environmental parameters. Result shows that TCGA 
scheme takes 0.496 seconds at GA, and GAS [9] takes 0.681 
seconds.  This  difference  in  the  computational  time  at  GA  to 
authenticate  one  device  shows  that  TCGA  is  energy  efficient 
as compared to the GAS. This makes TCGA lightweight, and 
it helps to alleviate battery exhaustion attack.  

 
 

Figure 5: TCGA Vs GAS  

 

 
The  proposed  TCGA  scheme  is  also  compared  with  GAS 
scheme  in  terms  of  the  computational  time  required  for 
authenticating devices. The number of devices varies from two 
to ten, and authentication time in seconds in measured for both 
TCGA  and  GAS.  Figure  5  shows  that,  TCGA  scheme 
performs  better  than  GAS  scheme.  Results  shown  in  the 
Figure  4,  and  5  shows  that  the  proposed  TCGA  scheme 
performs  better  in  terms  of  the  number  of  handshake, 
computations  at  GA  as  well  as  the  time  required  to 
authenticate varied number of devices.

Abstract:    Internet  of  things  (IoT)  is  an  emerging  paradigm 
where  the  devices  around  us  (persistent  and  non-persistent)  are 
connected  to  each  other  to  provide  seamless  communication,  and 
contextual services.  In the IoT, each device cannot be authenticated 
in the short time due to unbounded number of devices, and receipt of 
their  authentication  request  at  the  same  time.  Therefore,  secure,  and 
efficient  group  authentication,  and  authorization  scheme  is  required 
that  authenticates  a  group  of  devices  at  once  in  the  context  of 
resource  constrained  IoT.  This  paper  presents  novel  Threshold 
Cryptography-based  Group  Authentication  (TCGA)  scheme  for  the 
IoT  which  verifies  authenticity  of  all  the  devices  taking  part  in  the 
group  communication.  This  paper  also  presents  TCGA  framework 
which  is  flexible  and  secure.  The  proposed  TCGA  scheme  is 
implemented  for  WI-FI  environment,  and  the  result  shows  that 
TCGA  scheme  is  lightweight,  and  alleviates  the  effect  of  battery 
exhaustion attack. This paper also presents time analysis, and formal 
security  analysis  of  TCGA  scheme  which  shows  that  the  proposed 
TCGA scheme is safe from the replay, man-in-the-middle attack, and 
is scalable in nature.

I.  Introduction 

The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  refers  to  the  network 
interconnection  of  everyday  devices.  An  IoT  is  a  world-wide 
network  of  inter-connected  devices  uniquely  addressable, 
based  on  a  standard  communication  protocol.  In  the  IoT, 
people are surrounded by different types of computing devices 
which are billion in number, varied in size, and capabilities to 
communicate  with  each  other.  Devices  are  having  limited 
capabilities, and computing resources which range from Radio 
Frequency  Identification  (RFID)  tags  to  embedded  devices, 
PDA, and sensor nodes. IoT integrates the physical world with 
the  information  world,  and  provides  ambient  services,  and 
applications. 
IoT  networks  allow  users,  devices,  and 
applications  in  different  physical  locations  to  communicate 
seamlessly  with  one  another.  In  brief,  the  IoT  facilitates 
different  communication  patterns  like:  user-to-user,  user-to-
device,  device-to-device,  and  devices-to-user.  However,  the 
decentralized, and distributed nature of the IoT face challenges 
in  authentication,  access  control,  and  Identity  Management 
(IdM)  [2,  3,  and  4].  There  are  various  challenges  to  design 
security 
like  constraints,  and 
heterogeneous  communication,  resource  constraints,  and 
distributed nature.

IdM  of  devices  in  the  IoT  is  one  of  the  important 
challenges,  and  can  be  achieved  by  efficient  authentication 
schemes which are simple, secure, and lightweight. In the IoT, 
there  are  unbounded  numbers  of  heterogeneous  devices 
talking  to  each  other.  Each  device  should  not  be  able  to 
authenticate  during  the  short  time.  Due  to  the  scale  of 

devices 

to

individual 

economics,  more  than  hundreds  of  devices  may  request 
authentication  approval  at  the  same  time.  To  this  purpose, 
lightweight, scalable, and secure group authentication scheme 
is required which will authenticate groups of devices, and not 
the 
group 
communication.  This  paper  proposes  a  group  authentication 
scheme  using  Paillier  Threshold  Cryptography  [5,  6,  and  7] 
which  is  a  public  key  variant  of  the  (t,  n)  threshold  scheme 
where t is threshold, and n is number of group members. The 
Paillier  Cryptosystem  helps 
to  achieve  homomorphic 
properties, which is most suited for privacy preservation in the 
IoT  applications.  It  is  probabilistic  asymmetric  public  key 
encryption  system  which  uses  randomness  in  an  encryption 
algorithm,  so  that  when  encrypting  the  same,  plaintext  for 
several  times.  This  will  yield  different  cipher  texts.  The  key 
properties  of  Paillier  Cryptosystem  include  homomorphic 
addition, 
[5,  8]. 
Essentially,  the  Paillier  Cryptosystem  comprises  of  three 
algorithms:  key  generation,  encryption  and  decryption.    The 
proposed  TCGA  scheme  is  used  to  verify  the  authenticity  of 
all  the  members  taking  part  in  a  group  oriented  application. 
The  scheme  also  helps  in  establishing  a  shared  secret  key 
between  the  members  of  the  group  which  can  be  used  for 
further communication in any group oriented applications.

self-binding 

 
This  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  II  presents 
related works, and evaluation of the related works. Section III 
presents  the  proposed  TCGA  scheme  and  TCGA  framework. 
Section  IV  presents  the  implementation  results,  security 
analysis, and the discussion. Finally, section V summarizes the 
paper with the future work. 

 

II.  Related Works 

In a group authentication [9], participants belonging to the 
same  group  are  authenticated.  It  is  many-to-many  type  of 
authentication,  which  is  more  suited  for  group  oriented  IoT 
applications  as  there  are  more  number  of  devices.  Group 
authentication  for  users  is  presented  in  [9],  which  is  t-secure, 
m-user, n-group Group Authentication Scheme (GAS): ((t, m, 
n) GAS), where t is a threshold of the proposed scheme. In [9], 
resources,  constrained  devices  are  not  considered.  Scalable, 
and  decentralized  group  authentication  protocol  for  vehicular 
communication  is  presented  in  [10].    Detail  security  analysis 
of the proposed scheme is not presented in [10]. Group-based 
handover authentication scheme for mobile WiMAX networks 
is presented in [11], where handover of security context takes 
place  at  the  each  mobility.  It  consists  of  point  multiplication 
operation  at  each  node  which  adds  extra  overheads.  Secure 
mutual  authentication  protocol  for  RFID  is  presented  in  [12]. 
Hash-based encryption adds more overhead to this scheme. In 
[13],  the  profile  based  authentication,  and  authorization  is 

 

discussed  without  implementation  details,  and  results.  A 
group-based negotiation in peer to peer system is presented in 
[14], but authors have failed to discuss the security analysis of 
the  proposed  scheme.  Resource  negotiation  language  is 
discussed  in  the  scope  of  this  paper  but,  its  applicability  to 
other ad-hoc networks is left unaddressed. A lightweight, and 
distributed  group  authentication  scheme  for  ad-hoc  network 
devices  is  presented  in  [15].  Performance  analysis  of  the 
proposed scheme is not discussed in [15].  

 
From  the  state  of  the  art,  it  must  be  however  noted  that 
existing group authentication schemes are not lightweight, and 
secure.  Also in the context of IoT, there is a need of scalable 
group  authentication  scheme  due 
large  number  of 
heterogeneous devices.

III.  Proposed TCGA Scheme 

In  [9],  the  author  has  achieved  group  authentication  by 
releasing token based on Shamir’s (t, n) secret sharing scheme. 
This  paper  extends  this  work  using  Paillier  Threshold 
Cryptography.    Proposed  TCGA  scheme  also  establishes  a 
secret  session  key  at  the  end  of  each  group  authentication 
which  can  be  used  for  group  application.  TCGA  scheme  is 
implemented in WI-FI environment.   

 

Figure 1: Group Authentication 

 

 
Initially,  let’s  consider  an  environment  where  we  have 
devices in two contexts as shown in above Part I of the Figure 
1.  Each  group  contains  a  set  of  devices  communicating  with 
each other using  shared secret key. There can be any number 
of  groups  each  having  its  specified  range  of  connectivity 
according  to  the  WI-FI  standard.  These  groups  can  even 
overlap with each other with many devices capable of being a 
part of more than one group. Part II in the Figure 1 depicts the 
state  of 
the  environment  when  a  member  has  group 
authenticated  with  a  group.  Now,  if  a  device  of  the  group  B, 
wants  to  communicate  with  any  device  in  the  group  A,  then 
device will initiate the handshake, thereby authenticating itself 
with the  group A. Eventually, only authenticated devices from 
the  group  B  will  have  the  secret  of  the  group  A.  Now  it  can 
communicate  with all the  members of the  group  A since it is 
group authenticated. On the other hand, all the devices of the 
group  B  except  the  authenticated  one  cannot  communicate 
with the group A devices. The head of the group is required to 
generate,  and  distribute  the  new  key  pairs  every  time  a  new 
member enters the group to maintain group key leakage, and it 
is  referred  as  Group  Authority  (GA)  in  this  paper.  TCGA 
comprises following five modules: 

 

1.  Key Distribution. 
2.  Key Updation. 

3.  Group Credits Generation. 
4.  Authentication Listener. 
5.  Message Decryptor. 

 

Algorithms  for  these  five  modules  are  presented  below. 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that  it  takes  O  (n) 
time  for ‘n’ devices  which is  linear time, and, hence efficient 
for 
large  number  of  devices.  Time  analysis  of  group 
authentication  is  polynomial  time  with  O  (n2)  which  is  fairly 
good time for group oriented applications in IoT.

              = T (n-3) + 3*T (1)

              = T (n-k) + k*T (1), let’s put k = n-1 
        
        
  Hence T (n) = O (n)   

 T (n) = T (1) + n-1(T (1)) 
 T (n) = 2 + n*2 – 2 

 
Time  analysis  of  key  distribution  shows  that,  in  the 
proposed TCGA scheme, it takes O (n) time to distribute key 
amongst n devices. This shows that, even for large number of 
devices,  the  time  required  for  key  distribution  is  linear  and 
more appropriate for the scalable IoT.

Time Analysis: Group Authentication  
 
Recurrence relation can be written as: 
 
              T (n) = T (n-1) + O (n)   
              = T (n-2) + O (n-1)) + O (n) 
              = T (n-2) + O (n-1) + O (n) 
              = T (n-3) + O (n-2) + O (n-1) + O (n) 
                 ... 
              = T (1) + O (2) + ... + O (n-1) + O (n) 
              = O (1 + 2 + ... + n-1 + n) 
              = O (n2) 
 

Time  analysis  of  the  proposed TCGA  scheme  shows  that, 
to authenticate n devices to each other from different group, it 
takes  O  (n2)  time.  O  (n2)  represents  polynomial  time 
complexity and for even large number of devices, it performs 
better.  This  time  is  also  logarithmic  time  as  the  running  time 
of this algorithm is proportional to the square of input size. To 
summarize,  detailed  time  analysis  of  the  proposed  TCGA 
scheme shows that it is time efficient and, most suited for the 
IoT consisting of unbounded number of devices. 

 
TCGA  scheme  uses  a  variant  of 

the  public-key 
cryptography  known as Threshold Cryptography to develop a 
lightweight  group  authentication  mechanism  suitable  for  ad-
hoc devices. Group authentication aims at removing the  need 
to  establish  a  secure  connection  between  all  the  devices  in  a 

particular  group  every  time  they  want  to  communicate,  and 
thereby  reducing  the  number  of  handshakes  done  before  the 
communication  starts.  This  reduced  overhead  will  help  in 
conserving  battery  power  as  well  as  ensures  that  minimum 
numbers of resources are used. This provision of joining new 
member  to  the  group,  and  updating  threshold  value  for  new 
device,  and  generating  key  using  Threshold  Cryptography  is 
the  task  of  key  distribution  module.  Key  Updation  module 
generates public/ private key pairs for GA. The other members 
of the group change their private part keys using this module. 
The  Message  Decryptor  module  combines  all  the  partially 
decrypted  messages, and produces final a decrypted  message. 
The Authentication Listener  module listens for authentication 
request  if  any,  and  accepts  the  Partially  Decrypted  Message 
(PDM) from all the members.  TCGA works in two phases: 

Figure 2: TCGA Activity Diagram 

 

 

Complete  TCGA  scheme  is  depicted  in  the  Figure  2  with 
an  activity  diagram  which  describes  the  logical  processes,  or 
functions  where  each  process  describes  a  sequence  of  tasks, 
and decisions that govern when, and how they are performed. 

 
a.  Pre-Authentication Phase 

 

In this phase, the GA of the group, who creates the group, 
is responsible for generating a public key KPu  (G) and multiple 
private  keys  KPr1  (G)…..KPrn  (G)  using  Paillier  Threshold 
Cryptosystem  depending  upon  the  number  of  members  (n)  in 
the  group,  and  the  threshold  value  t.  Private  keys  K  Pr1(G)…..K 
Prn(G) are then distributed by the GA among all the members of 
the group. When a new member joins the group, the threshold 
value  is  changed  appropriately,  and  keys  are  generated,  and 
distributed again. This threshold value changes dynamically as 
new  members  join  so  that  the  high  level  of  security  is 
maintained. 
 

b.  Group Authentication Phase  

 

If a group activity needs to be started, group authentication 
needs  to  be  performed  as  a  pre-requisite  to  check  if  all  the 
members  M1…Mm  (where  m<=n)  are  part  of  the  group.  The 
GA chooses a pseudo-random number as a session secret [SS] 
key  which  is  going  to  be  shared  with  all  the  members  of  the 
group once the group authentication is done. This is encrypted 
using  the  public  key  [KPu]  of  the  group,  and  sent  to  all  the 
members of the group. The hash of the session secret H [SS] is 
also sent along with it. 

Message = {[SS] KPu, H [SS]} 

Each  of  the  members,  upon  reception  of  this  message, 
applies their private key part to decrypt it, giving them a PDM. 
Each  device  has  a  unique  PDM  corresponding  to  a  different 
part key.  

 

PDM = Decrypt (Message, PrivatePartKey) 

Each  device  then  sends  this  PDM  to  every  member 
including  the  GA.  All  the  devices  wait  to  combine  all  the 
PDMs until n-1 PDMs are received. Each device combines all 
the PDMs so as to get the decrypted session key.  

 
Session Key = Combine (PDM1, PDM2… PDMm) 
 
If combining all PDM shares is successful, the session key 
is obtained and it proves that all the members are a part of that 
group  only.  The  Decrypted  session  key  is  hashed  to  get  H’ 
[SS] and checked with the one sent by the GA. If H’ [SS] = H 
[SS], then authentication is successful, and session key [SS] is 
obtained.  This  comparison  is  made  to  check  whether  the 
session key obtained is valid. The session key [SS] obtained in 
the  last  step  can  be  used  for  further  communication  between 
the  devices  which  can  be  carried  out  using  Symmetric  Key 
Encryption.  If  combining  all  PDM  shares  is  unsuccessful 
means that there is at least one non-member in the group, and, 
hence the activity cannot be initiated, and group authentication 
fails.  Further  individual  authentication  needs  to  be  done  to 
identify the non-member in the group. 
 

To summarize, when any particular member wants to start 
a  group  activity,  it  send  a  request  to  the  current  GA.  On 
reception  of  the  request,  the  GA  generates  a  session  secret 
which is going to be shared by all the members of that group. 
This session secret is then encrypted with the public key of the 
group.  This  provides  the  required  security  as  it  can  only  be 
decrypted by the complete private  key.  A Hash  map  function 
is  applied  to  the  session  secret  which  is  going  to  be  used  in 
further  steps  to  prove  the  integrity  of  this  message.  It  is  sent 
along  with  the  encrypted  session  secret  in  a  single  message.  
This message is sent to all the members of the group. All the 
devices  then  use  their  own  part  private  keys  to  decrypt  this 
message  which  gives  them  a  PDM  which  is  not  the  final 
session secret. Now it sends this PDM to each member in the 
group. Until n-1 PDMs are received each of the devices waits. 
All the devices then try to combine all of the shares which will 
ultimately  give  them  the  final  session  secret.  If  successful, 
means that all the PDMs received are by the legitimate group 
members  only,  and,  hence  the  group  authentication  succeeds. 
The group activity can then be started using the session secret 
for further communication. If unsuccessful, means that there is 
at least one device which is using a fake part private key and 
hence the partial decryption  generated by  him is not genuine. 
Therefore, upon trying to combine all  the  shares it  was result 
in failure. This means that group authentication fails, and there 
is a need to restart the process. 
 

Figure 3: Proposed TCGA Framework 

 

 

•  Proposed TCGA Framework 
 
In  the  IoT  communication,  there  are  devices  belonging  to 
same group or different group communicating to each other in 
distributed  manner.  When  devices  of 
the  same  group 
communicate  with  each  other,  there  is  some  amount  of  trust 
available between them. But when the devices of the different 
group communicate to each other, proposed TCGA scheme is 
required.  Proposed  TCGA  framework  is  presented  in  the 
Figure  3.  Framework  depicts  the  major  components  of 
authentication  process.  In  the  IoT  applications  like  banking, 
utilities,  agriculture  and  healthcare,  authentication  is  a  major 

 

concern.  When  the  devices  belonging  to  different  groups 
communicate to each other through Internet, TCGA performs 
key distribution, key updation, message decryption and finally 
group authentication in order to authenticate each other.  
 

The security analysis of the proposed TCGA framework is 
given  below.  Security  analysis  shows  that  proposed  TCGA 
framework 
realizes  many-to-many 
authentication and secure in distributed environment.

IV.  Results and Discussion 

TCGA  scheme  is  implemented  for  WI-FI  using  laptop 
devices.  All  the  devices  communicate  with  each  other  with 
respect  to  their  individual  group.  Implementation  results  are 
discussed below. 

 

Implementation Results: 

• 
 
Working  of  TCGA  shows  that,  generating  session  secret, 
encryption,  and  hashing  take  place  at  GA.  In  this  paper, 
TCGA  scheme  is  compared  with  the  group  authentication 
scheme presented in [9] in terms of the number of handshake 
between  GA,  and  device  to  device.  Number  of  handshakes 
between  communicating  entities  and  the  computation  at  the 
respective  entity  is  directly  related  to  the  computational 
overhead of the authentication scheme. In the TCGA scheme, 
the number of handshakes between devices, and GA are three 
which include request for the session secret, sending a reply to 
the device comprising of (SS, Kpu (G), H [SS], and finally the 
reply 
successful 
authentication,  or  failure.  In  the  scheme  presented  in  [9],  the 
number  of  handshakes  between  GA,  and  communicating 
entity  (user)  are  four  which  includes  all  user  registration, 
sending  private  token  to  each  user,  GA  assisted  group 
authentication,  and  the  result  of  authentication  to  GA.  In 
TCGA scheme, three types of computation takes place at GA 
which  includes  generation  of  session  secret,  encryption,  and 
hash creation.

Figure 4: Number of Devices Vs Group Authentication Time 

 

 
A series of three measurements have been taken to find the 
group authentication time in seconds by increasing the number 
of  devices  from  two  to  ten.  Figure  4  shows  that,  with  the 
increase  in  the  number  of  devices,  there  is  no  significant 
change in the authentication time. This result shows that, even 
the  numbers  of  devices  are  increased  at  a  faster  rate;  there  is 
no  increase  in  the  authentication  time  at  the  same  rate.  This 
shows that TCGA scheme is scalable, and best suited for IoT 
consisting of unbound number of devices.  
 

 
In  [9],  computations  takes  place  at  GA  includes  selecting 
random  polynomial  of  degree  t-1,  computing  n  tokens,  token 
distribution to all group members, and the selection of secret. 
Hence,  there  are  four  different  types  of  computation  taking 
place  at  GA  in  this  case.  Table  I  shows  the  comparison  of 
TCGA  scheme  with  the  scheme  proposed  in  [9]  for  different 
comparative parameters.  

 
The  proposed  TCGA  scheme  is  implemented  for  WI-FI 
devices  using  laptop  devices  of  the  same  configuration  in 
order to compare the computational time. Computational time 
is  measured  at  GA  for  authenticating  one  device,  and  the 
average of three measurements is taken to avoid the variation 
caused by environmental parameters. Result shows that TCGA 
scheme takes 0.496 seconds at GA, and GAS [9] takes 0.681 
seconds.  This  difference  in  the  computational  time  at  GA  to 
authenticate  one  device  shows  that  TCGA  is  energy  efficient 
as compared to the GAS. This makes TCGA lightweight, and 
it helps to alleviate battery exhaustion attack.  

 
 

Figure 5: TCGA Vs GAS  

 

 
The  proposed  TCGA  scheme  is  also  compared  with  GAS 
scheme  in  terms  of  the  computational  time  required  for 
authenticating devices. The number of devices varies from two 
to ten, and authentication time in seconds in measured for both 
TCGA  and  GAS.  Figure  5  shows  that,  TCGA  scheme 
performs  better  than  GAS  scheme.  Results  shown  in  the 
Figure  4,  and  5  shows  that  the  proposed  TCGA  scheme 
performs  better  in  terms  of  the  number  of  handshake, 
computations  at  GA  as  well  as  the  time  required  to 
authenticate varied number of devices.  

 
 

 

•  Security Analysis 

 

The  proposed  TCGA  scheme  is  also  analyzed  for  the 
replay attack, and man-in-the-middle attack. The analysis is as 
follows: 

Replay Attack 

i. 
Replay  attack  is  one  in  which  a  valid  data  transmission 
between  two  devices  is  intercepted,  and  is  reused  with 
malicious  intent.  Let's  consider  the  scenario  in  which  an 
attacker M possessing the symmetric key tries to communicate 
with a third person belonging to the same group in subsequent 
sessions.  This  will  not  be  possible  as  the  session  key  is 
dynamically changed as each new group activity is initiated. 

 

Man-in-the-Middle Attack 

ii. 
A  man-in-the-middle  attack  is  a  one  in  which  an  attacker 
M  makes  an  independent  connection  with  the  victims  A,  and 
B,  making  them  believe  that  they  are  communicating  with 
each  other.  The  attacker  M  intercepts  the  message  coming 
from A to B, and B to A, and re-routes them. In our proposed 
scheme,  the  session  key  is  established  between  the  members 
of 
the  group  activity.  Any 
communication  between  the  group  members  is  secured  by 
using symmetric key encryption using this session key. Hence, 
the attacker M cannot decrypt the messages between A, and B, 
and  misuse  the  information  sent  between  the  legitimate 
devices.

V.  Conclusions and Future Work 

secures 

lightweight, 

scalable,  and 

In the IoT, there are unbounded numbers of heterogeneous 
devices talking to each other. Each device should  not be able 
to  authenticate  during  the  short  time.  Due  to  the  scale  of 
economics,  more  than  hundreds  of  devices  may  request 
authentication approval at the same time. To this purpose, this 
paper has presented TCGA which is Threshold Cryptography-
based 
the  Group 
Authentication  scheme.  This  scheme  not  only  established  a 
group  authentication  scheme  which  ensures  the  simultaneous 
authentication  of  all  the  members  of  a  group  using  Paillier 
Threshold  Cryptography  but  also  established  a  secret  session 
key which can be used for communication that might occur in 
group oriented applications.  The Implementation results have 
been  measured  for  computational  time  and  authentication 
time, and also compared with the existing work. Results shows 
that, proposed TCGA scheme is lightweight and scalable, and 
alleviates  the  effect  of  battery  exhaustion  attack.  Security 
analysis of TCGA is also presented in this paper which shows 
that,  TCGA  is  resistant  to  replay,  and  man-in-the-middle 
attack. 

The future plan is to integrate TCGA scheme with the IdM 
framework  presented  in  [16].  Implementation  of  TCGA  for 
wireless  sensor  network,  and  RFID  is  also  another  good 
research area to continue.
