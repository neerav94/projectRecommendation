1 INTRODUCTION 

The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  is  the  network  of  physical 
objects  accessed  through  the  Internet,  as  defined  by 
technology analysts and visionaries. These objects contain 
embedded technology to interact with internal states or the 
external  environment.  In  other  words,  when  objects  can 
sense  and  communicate,  it  changes  how  and  where 
decisions  are  made,  and  who  makes  them.  The  IoT  is 
connecting  new  places–such  as  manufacturing  floors, 
energy  grids,  healthcare  facilities,  and 
transportation 
systems–to the Internet. When an object can represent itself 
digitally,  it  can  be  controlled  from  anywhere.  This 
connectivity means more data, gathered from more places, 
with more ways to increase efficiency and improve safety 
and security. 
Internet  of  Things  gives  objects  the  capacity  to  identify 
itself,  perceive  the  surrounding  data,  interact  with  servers 
over  the  internet  and  make  queries  to  change  their  state. 
These objects can be personal objects such as smart phones, 
digital cameras or elements in our environment.  
Radio-frequency

prerequisite  for  the  Internet  of  Things.  RFID  is  used  for 
sensing  the  objects  and  also  for  transfer  of  information 
about the object onto the network wirelessly till it reaches 
its destination.  
The basic ideology behind the working of RFID technology 
is explained in section II, section III briefs on how RFID is

RFID  is  often  seen  as  a  prerequisite  for  the  Internet  of 
Things.  The  typical  internet  of  things  based  on  RFID  is 
composed  of  three  major  components  including  RFID 
system, middleware system and Internet system. 
a)  RFID  system  consists  of  readers,  tags  and  antennas. 
Identification of target is done with a unique Electronic 
Product Code (EPC) saved in RFID tag. RFID tags are 
wireless  devices  which  communicate  with  RFID 
readers.  Readers 
transport,  receiver  and 
microprocessor  responsible  for  reading  or  writing  tag 
information.  Radio-frequency  signals  between  RFID 
tag  and  the  reader  are  transmitted  by  Antennas.  This 
layer  collects  information  and  identifies  the  physical 
world.  

include 

b) The middleware system is responsible for information 
transmission,  initial  processing  of  information,  and 
classification  of  data.  This  layer  includes  key  server 
and Object Naming Service (ONS) server.  

c)  The  Internet  system  is  responsible  for  analysis, 
processing, control and decision making of information 
to implement customized services ordered by users and 
controlling  the  connection between  things  and  things. 
This  layer  includes  the  internet  and  database  (PML 
database). 

Figure 2:  Working of IOT 

 

 
Through  the  EPC  code  saved  in  RFID  tag,  the  reader 
collects data from the tag. The middleware system can find 
the  relevant  information  of  the  object  by  finding  the 
corresponding IP address on the Object Naming Server on 
the internet through this EPC code and the information is 
processed and managed by the middleware system 
 

IV.  SMART ENVIRONMENT WITH IOT 

We  propose  the  use  of  IOT  which  uses  intelligent  bar 
codes(RFID) that can talk to a networked system to track 
every product that you put in your shopping cart. IOT with 
RFIDs  can  be  used    in  shopping  malls.  These  RFID  tags 
will communicate with an electronic reader that will detect 
every  item  in  the  cart.  The  reader  will  be  connected  to  a 
large network that will send information on your products 

to  the  retailer  and  product  manufacturers.  Your bank will 
then be notified and the amount of the bill will be deducted 
from your account.  
• 

 At  the  grocery  store,  you  buy  a  carton  of  milk.  The 
milk containers will have an RFID tag that stores the 
milk's expiration date and price. When you lift the milk 
from the shelf, the shelf may display the milk's specific 
expiration date, or the information could be wirelessly 
sent to your personal digital assistant or cell phone. 

•  As you exit the store, you pass through doors with an 
embedded tag reader. This reader tabulates the cost of 
all  the  items  in  your  shopping  cart  and  sends  the 
grocery  bill  to  your  bank,  which  deducts  the  amount 
from  your  account.  Product  manufacturers  know  that 
you've bought their product, and the store's computers 
know  exactly  how  many  of  each  product  need  to  be 
reordered. 

•  Once  you  get  home,  you  put  your  milk 

in 
the refrigerator,  which  is  also  equipped  with  a  tag 
reader. This smart refrigerator is capable of tracking all 
of the groceries stored in it. It can track the foods you 
use  and  how  often  you  restock  your  refrigerator,  and 
can let you know when that milk and other foods spoil. 
•  Products are also tracked when they are thrown into a 
trash can or recycle bin. At this point, your refrigerator 
could  add  milk  to  your  grocery  list,  or  you  could 
program the fridge to order these items automatically. 
•  Based on the products you buy, your grocery store gets 
to know your unique preferences. Instead of receiving 
generic newsletters with weekly grocery specials, you 
might receive one created just for you.  

  In  order  for  this  system  to  work,  each  product  will  be 
given  a  unique  product  number.  MIT's  Auto-ID  Center  is 
working  on  an Electronic  Product  Code (EPC)  identifier 
that could replace the UPC. Every smart label could contain 
96 bits of information, including the product manufacturer, 
product  name  and  a  40-bit  serial  number.  Using  this 
system, a smart label would communicate with a network 
called  the Object  Naming  Service.  This  database  would 
retrieve  information  about  a  product  and  then  direct 
information to the manufacturer's computers. 
 

V. PROTECTING OBECT INFORMATION SENT FROM TAG 
1.  Killing the Tag 
The manufacturer of the items can embed C1G2 UHF Tags 
with  a  Kill  Password  as  per  the  EPCglobal  C1G2  UHF 
RFID  Protocol  standard  [3].  the  tag  is  permanently 
unusable and unreadable  whenever an RFID reader sends 
this kill password to the tag. Therefore, once a tagged item 
is  purchased  by  customer,  the  cashier  (  point-of-sale)  can 
obtain  the  tag's  kill  password  from  the  store's  EPC-
Information system and kill the tag permanently.  
2. Locking the Tag 
The manufacturer of the items can also embed C1G2 UHF 
Tags with a unique 32-bit value Access Password as per the 
EPCglobal C1G2 UHF RFID Protocol standard [3] .The tag 
verifies  the  access  password  sent  by  the  RFID  reader  to 
check if it is the  same as the one embedded within itself. If 
the  access  passwords  tally,  the  tag  allows  the  reader  to 
perform Read, Write, and Lock operation on it. A tag's chip

password and access password. The reserved memory bank 
is permanently locked by the manufacturer; as a result the 
access  password  can  neither  be  read  nor modified  by  any 
reader. As mentioned above, most of the tags contain only 
its unique EPC number and all the data associated with that 
EPC  number 
the  EPC-Information 
system(EPC-IS).  Access  to  the  EPC-IS  is  secure,  and 
restricted  to  only  authorized  supply  chain  stakeholders. 
Generally, the EPC memory bank is never locked, because 
the EPC number is used to retrieve the data associated with 
that  item  and  also  to  retrieve  its  corresponding  access 
password  (from  EPC-IS).  Based  on  the  above-mentioned 
access password and locking features available with C1G2 
UHF  tags,  we  propose  the  following  approach,  where  the 
tag  need  not  be  killed  permanently  in  order  to  protect 
consumer  privacy.  Once  a  tagged  item  is  purchased  by 
customer, the clerk at the point-of-sale can retrieve the tag's 
access  password  from  the  store's  EPC-IS  and  using  this 
access password, the clerk can lock all the memory banks 
of the tag including the EPC memory bank. The customer 
can  download  and  store  the  EPC  numbers  and  their 
corresponding  access  passwords  into  her  mobile/smart 
phone.  This  can  be  made  possible  via  the  mobile  RFID-
enabled  mobile/smart  phone  communicating  with  the 
mobile  RFID-module  at 
this 
proposed  approach,  the  intruder  can  no  longer  get  any 
information  (including  the  EPC  number)  from  the  RFID 
tags  that  are  in  customer's  possession,  as  all  the  memory 
banks of the tags are locked and intruder does not have the 
access passwords. 
After purchasing the RFID tagged items from the store, the 
retailer terminal allows the shop manager to download and 
store  the  EPC  numbers  and  their  corresponding  access 
passwords  into  the  mobile  RFID-enabled  mobile/smart 
phone. Shop manager uses the Smartphone's 3G/4G/Wi-FI 
network  to  establish  an  HTTPS  (Hypertext  Transfer 
Protocol  Secure)  connection  [5]  with  the  shop  server,  in 
order to send the EPC numbers and their access passwords. 
Based on the EPC numbers, the shop server identifies the 
appropriate EPC-IS and uses the access passwords as proof 
of  purchase,  downloads  the  related  information  (product 
description,  size,  weight,  manufacturing  date,  expiry  date, 
directions  to  use,  ingredients,  warranty  certificate,  etc.) 
associated  with  the  EPC  numbers.  The  EPC-IS  must 
provide  only  the  information,  which  is  relevant  to  the 
consumer who purchased the items. Therefore, by the time 
shop manager has purchased tagged items, the shop server 
is  ready  with  all  the  information  about  the  items.  After 
obtaining  the  EPC  numbers  from  Shop  managers  mobile 
RFID-device,  the  shop  server  now  needs  to  contact  the 
appropriate  EPC-IS  to  download  the  related  information 
associated  with  the  EPC  numbers.  As  per  the  EPCglobal 
Architecture  Specification  [2],  there  exists  an  Object 
Naming Service (ONS), which can assist the shop server in 
locating the EPC-IS. The retailer at the point-of-sale gives 
away  the  access  passwords  to  only  those  consumers  who 
purchased the tagged items. The EPC-IS already has the list 
of EPC numbers and their corresponding access passwords, 

therefore when the shop server sends the access passwords 
to  the  EPC-IS  it  proves  that  shop  manager/shop  server 
indeed purchased the tagged items.

device, shop server and EPC-IS.

and shop server. 

 
The  RFID  reader  in  the  Shop  does  not  get  any  EPC 
numbers  from  the  newly  added  items  in  the  shop  as  their 
memory banks are all locked. In such a situation, the RFID 
reader communicates with the shop server and requests all 
the RFID tag access passwords that have been downloaded 
by  the  server  (from  EPC-IS)  but  not  yet  activated  in  the 
smart shop. The shop server then sends all those access  to 
the RFID reader in the shop and the reader checks each of 
these passwords with every locked tag until a particular tag 
responds  with  its  EPC  number.  With  this  approach  a  tag 
can be unlocked without knowing its EPC number initially. 
This  approach  can  be  easily  understood by  looking  at  the

1 INTRODUCTION 

The  Internet  of  Things  (IoT)  is  the  network  of  physical 
objects  accessed  through  the  Internet,  as  defined  by 
technology analysts and visionaries. These objects contain 
embedded technology to interact with internal states or the 
external  environment.  In  other  words,  when  objects  can 
sense  and  communicate,  it  changes  how  and  where 
decisions  are  made,  and  who  makes  them.  The  IoT  is 
connecting  new  places–such  as  manufacturing  floors, 
energy  grids,  healthcare  facilities,  and 
transportation 
systems–to the Internet. When an object can represent itself 
digitally,  it  can  be  controlled  from  anywhere.  This 
connectivity means more data, gathered from more places, 
with more ways to increase efficiency and improve safety 
and security. 
Internet  of  Things  gives  objects  the  capacity  to  identify 
itself,  perceive  the  surrounding  data,  interact  with  servers 
over  the  internet  and  make  queries  to  change  their  state. 
These objects can be personal objects such as smart phones, 
digital cameras or elements in our environment.  
Radio-frequency 
as 
is 
prerequisite  for  the  Internet  of  Things.  RFID  is  used  for 
sensing  the  objects  and  also  for  transfer  of  information 
about the object onto the network wirelessly till it reaches 
its destination.  
The basic ideology behind the working of RFID technology 
is explained in section II, section III briefs on how RFID is 
used in implementing internet of things, the use of IOT in 
Smart Environment and its secure use is briefed in section 
IV and V respectively and section VI has conclusion with 
the basic summary of the advantages of using this method 
of authentication.

use 

    Radio-frequency  identification (RFID)  is  the  wireless 
non-contact 
radio-frequency electromagnetic 
fields to  transfer  data,  for  the  purposes  of  automatically 
identifying  and  tracking  tags  attached  to  objects.  Data 
stored  on  RFID  tags  can  be  changed,  updated  and 

of 

locked. RFID  tags  can  be  broadly  classified  into  3  types: 
active,  semi-passive  and passive. Active  and  semi-passive 
RFID tags use internal batteries to power their circuits. An 
active tag also uses its battery to broadcast radio waves to a 
reader. The semi-passive tag relies on the reader to supply 
its power for broadcasting. Passive RFID tags rely entirely 
on  the  reader  as  their  power  source.  The  active  and  semi 
passive tags contain more hardware than the passive RFID 
tags,  hence  they  are  more  expensive  compared  to  passive 
tags.  Therefore  Active  and  semi-passive  tags  are  reserved 
for  costly  items  and  passive  tags  are  used  for  relatively 
cheaper items.  Nevertheless , all the 3 category of tags are 
manufactured  to  be  disposable,  along  with  the  disposable 
consumer goods on which they are placed. 
These tags can be of 3 storage types    
1. read-write: Data can be added or overwritten. 
2. read-only: This cannot be overwritten  they contain only 
the data that  is stored in them when they were made.  
3.  write-once,  read  many(WORM):  Tags  can  have 
additional data added once, but they cannot be overwritten. 
The  mode  of  communication  between  the  reader  and  the 
tag  of  an  RFID  system  is  based  on  radio  frequency  (RF) 
technology. 
A  simplified  RFID  system  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  tag 
includes the antenna within itself, which is responsible for 
providing  communication  while  the  reader  is  usually 
having  one  or  two  antennas.  The  reader  which  contains  a 
trans-receiver generates a pulse of electromagnetic waves. 
The transponder receives the transmission which is further, 
rectified to get the dc power supply for the IC memory. 

 

Figure 1. Simplified RFID system architecture. 

 
The processed signal transmitted by the transponder is then 
received by the reader again to obtain the tag’s ID number. 
As  the  RFID  technology  is  simple,  more  flexible  and 
relatively  cheaper  it  is  nowadays  gaining  attention  in  a 
large  number  of 
as  personal 
identification,  food  production  control,  security  guard 
monitoring, and inventory management.

RFID  is  often  seen  as  a  prerequisite  for  the  Internet  of 
Things.  The  typical  internet  of  things  based  on  RFID  is 
composed  of  three  major  components  including  RFID 
system, middleware system and Internet system. 
a)  RFID  system  consists  of  readers,  tags  and  antennas. 
Identification of target is done with a unique Electronic 
Product Code (EPC) saved in RFID tag. RFID tags are 
wireless  devices  which  communicate  with  RFID 
readers.  Readers 
transport,  receiver  and 
microprocessor  responsible  for  reading  or  writing  tag 
information.  Radio-frequency  signals  between  RFID 
tag  and  the  reader  are  transmitted  by  Antennas.  This 
layer  collects  information  and  identifies  the  physical 
world.  

include 

b) The middleware system is responsible for information 
transmission,  initial  processing  of  information,  and 
classification  of  data.  This  layer  includes  key  server 
and Object Naming Service (ONS) server.  

c)  The  Internet  system  is  responsible  for  analysis, 
processing, control and decision making of information 
to implement customized services ordered by users and 
controlling  the  connection between  things  and  things. 
This  layer  includes  the  internet  and  database  (PML 
database). 

Figure 2:  Working of IOT 

 

 
Through  the  EPC  code  saved  in  RFID  tag,  the  reader 
collects data from the tag. The middleware system can find 
the  relevant  information  of  the  object  by  finding  the 
corresponding IP address on the Object Naming Server on 
the internet through this EPC code and the information is 
processed and managed by the middleware system 
 

IV.  SMART ENVIRONMENT WITH IOT 

We  propose  the  use  of  IOT  which  uses  intelligent  bar 
codes(RFID) that can talk to a networked system to track 
every product that you put in your shopping cart. IOT with 
RFIDs  can  be  used    in  shopping  malls.  These  RFID  tags 
will communicate with an electronic reader that will detect 
every  item  in  the  cart.  The  reader  will  be  connected  to  a 
large network that will send information on your products 

to  the  retailer  and  product  manufacturers.  Your bank will 
then be notified and the amount of the bill will be deducted 
from your account.  
• 

 At  the  grocery  store,  you  buy  a  carton  of  milk.  The 
milk containers will have an RFID tag that stores the 
milk's expiration date and price. When you lift the milk 
from the shelf, the shelf may display the milk's specific 
expiration date, or the information could be wirelessly 
sent to your personal digital assistant or cell phone. 

•  As you exit the store, you pass through doors with an 
embedded tag reader. This reader tabulates the cost of 
all  the  items  in  your  shopping  cart  and  sends  the 
grocery  bill  to  your  bank,  which  deducts  the  amount 
from  your  account.  Product  manufacturers  know  that 
you've bought their product, and the store's computers 
know  exactly  how  many  of  each  product  need  to  be 
reordered. 

•  Once  you  get  home,  you  put  your  milk 

in 
the refrigerator,  which  is  also  equipped  with  a  tag 
reader. This smart refrigerator is capable of tracking all 
of the groceries stored in it. It can track the foods you 
use  and  how  often  you  restock  your  refrigerator,  and 
can let you know when that milk and other foods spoil. 
•  Products are also tracked when they are thrown into a 
trash can or recycle bin. At this point, your refrigerator 
could  add  milk  to  your  grocery  list,  or  you  could 
program the fridge to order these items automatically. 
•  Based on the products you buy, your grocery store gets 
to know your unique preferences. Instead of receiving 
generic newsletters with weekly grocery specials, you 
might receive one created just for you.  

  In  order  for  this  system  to  work,  each  product  will  be 
given  a  unique  product  number.  MIT's  Auto-ID  Center  is 
working  on  an Electronic  Product  Code (EPC)  identifier 
that could replace the UPC. Every smart label could contain 
96 bits of information, including the product manufacturer, 
product  name  and  a  40-bit  serial  number.  Using  this 
system, a smart label would communicate with a network 
called  the Object  Naming  Service.  This  database  would 
retrieve  information  about  a  product  and  then  direct 
information to the manufacturer's computers. 
 

V. PROTECTING OBECT INFORMATION SENT FROM TAG 
1.  Killing the Tag 
The manufacturer of the items can embed C1G2 UHF Tags 
with  a  Kill  Password  as  per  the  EPCglobal  C1G2  UHF 
RFID  Protocol  standard  [3].  the  tag  is  permanently 
unusable and unreadable  whenever an RFID reader sends 
this kill password to the tag. Therefore, once a tagged item 
is  purchased  by  customer,  the  cashier  (  point-of-sale)  can 
obtain  the  tag's  kill  password  from  the  store's  EPC-
Information system and kill the tag permanently.  
2. Locking the Tag 
The manufacturer of the items can also embed C1G2 UHF 
Tags with a unique 32-bit value Access Password as per the 
EPCglobal C1G2 UHF RFID Protocol standard [3] .The tag 
verifies  the  access  password  sent  by  the  RFID  reader  to 
check if it is the  same as the one embedded within itself. If 
the  access  passwords  tally,  the  tag  allows  the  reader  to 
perform Read, Write, and Lock operation on it. A tag's chip

the  point-of-sale.  With 

has  four  memory  banks:  Reserved,  EPC,  TID,  and  User. 
The  Reserved  memory  bank  is  used  to  store  the  kill 
password and access password. The reserved memory bank 
is permanently locked by the manufacturer; as a result the 
access  password  can  neither  be  read  nor modified  by  any 
reader. As mentioned above, most of the tags contain only 
its unique EPC number and all the data associated with that 
EPC  number 
the  EPC-Information 
system(EPC-IS).  Access  to  the  EPC-IS  is  secure,  and 
restricted  to  only  authorized  supply  chain  stakeholders. 
Generally, the EPC memory bank is never locked, because 
the EPC number is used to retrieve the data associated with 
that  item  and  also  to  retrieve  its  corresponding  access 
password  (from  EPC-IS).  Based  on  the  above-mentioned 
access password and locking features available with C1G2 
UHF  tags,  we  propose  the  following  approach,  where  the 
tag  need  not  be  killed  permanently  in  order  to  protect 
consumer  privacy.  Once  a  tagged  item  is  purchased  by 
customer, the clerk at the point-of-sale can retrieve the tag's 
access  password  from  the  store's  EPC-IS  and  using  this 
access password, the clerk can lock all the memory banks 
of the tag including the EPC memory bank. The customer 
can  download  and  store  the  EPC  numbers  and  their 
corresponding  access  passwords  into  her  mobile/smart 
phone.  This  can  be  made  possible  via  the  mobile  RFID-
enabled  mobile/smart  phone  communicating  with  the 
mobile  RFID-module  at 
this 
proposed  approach,  the  intruder  can  no  longer  get  any 
information  (including  the  EPC  number)  from  the  RFID 
tags  that  are  in  customer's  possession,  as  all  the  memory 
banks of the tags are locked and intruder does not have the 
access passwords. 
After purchasing the RFID tagged items from the store, the 
retailer terminal allows the shop manager to download and 
store  the  EPC  numbers  and  their  corresponding  access 
passwords  into  the  mobile  RFID-enabled  mobile/smart 
phone. Shop manager uses the Smartphone's 3G/4G/Wi-FI 
network  to  establish  an  HTTPS  (Hypertext  Transfer 
Protocol  Secure)  connection  [5]  with  the  shop  server,  in 
order to send the EPC numbers and their access passwords. 
Based on the EPC numbers, the shop server identifies the 
appropriate EPC-IS and uses the access passwords as proof 
of  purchase,  downloads  the  related  information  (product 
description,  size,  weight,  manufacturing  date,  expiry  date, 
directions  to  use,  ingredients,  warranty  certificate,  etc.) 
associated  with  the  EPC  numbers.  The  EPC-IS  must 
provide  only  the  information,  which  is  relevant  to  the 
consumer who purchased the items. Therefore, by the time 
shop manager has purchased tagged items, the shop server 
is  ready  with  all  the  information  about  the  items.  After 
obtaining  the  EPC  numbers  from  Shop  managers  mobile 
RFID-device,  the  shop  server  now  needs  to  contact  the 
appropriate  EPC-IS  to  download  the  related  information 
associated  with  the  EPC  numbers.  As  per  the  EPCglobal 
Architecture  Specification  [2],  there  exists  an  Object 
Naming Service (ONS), which can assist the shop server in 
locating the EPC-IS. The retailer at the point-of-sale gives 
away  the  access  passwords  to  only  those  consumers  who 
purchased the tagged items. The EPC-IS already has the list 
of EPC numbers and their corresponding access passwords, 

therefore when the shop server sends the access passwords 
to  the  EPC-IS  it  proves  that  shop  manager/shop  server 
indeed purchased the tagged items. 

 
Figure 3. Secure Communication between mobile- RFID-

device, shop server and EPC-IS. 

 

 
Figure 4.  Secure Communication between the Shop objects 

and shop server. 

 
The  RFID  reader  in  the  Shop  does  not  get  any  EPC 
numbers  from  the  newly  added  items  in  the  shop  as  their 
memory banks are all locked. In such a situation, the RFID 
reader communicates with the shop server and requests all 
the RFID tag access passwords that have been downloaded 
by  the  server  (from  EPC-IS)  but  not  yet  activated  in  the 
smart shop. The shop server then sends all those access  to 
the RFID reader in the shop and the reader checks each of 
these passwords with every locked tag until a particular tag 
responds  with  its  EPC  number.  With  this  approach  a  tag 
can be unlocked without knowing its EPC number initially. 
This  approach  can  be  easily  understood by  looking  at  the 
Figure 4.
