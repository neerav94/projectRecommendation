Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments.

methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online

can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools:

of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based

 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them.

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports.

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization.

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning 

There are also many articles  on learning analytics published 
in various journal such as Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal 
of  Educational  Technology  &  Society,  International  Review  of 
Research 
(IRRODL),

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

                                                                   ICTACT JOURNAL ON SOFT COMPUTING:  
SPECIAL ISSUE ON SOFT COMPUTING MODELS FOR BIG DATA, JULY 2015, VOLUME: 05, ISSUE: 04 

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization. 

5.  LITERATURE REVIEW

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  data  collection  process 
resulted in the identification of a total of 90 distinct articles. 45 
articles  were  selected  for  the  search  term  “Educational  Data 
Mining”  [15-59]  and  another  45  articles  were  selected  for  the 
search term “Learning Analytics” [11; 60-103]. From the search 
results, it can be seen that all these articles have been frequently 
cited by other  researchers.  As these articles are frequently  cited 
by  researchers,  they  can  be  selected  as  a  good  representative 
sample of the literature in the field. 

5.2.2  Data Classification/Analysis 

Articles were classified both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The  quantitative  analysis  was  used  to  classify  the  papers 
according  to  the  publication  year  and  the  type  of  publication  in 
which the articles appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified 
using  open  coded  content  analysis  whereby  each  paper  was 
reviewed to identify themes and trends in the literature. 

5.3  RESULTS 

5.3.1  Quantitative Details: 

From the 45 articles selected on “Educational Data Mining” , 
17 were published in 2010, 6 in 2011, 14 in 2012, 5 in 2013 and 
3  in  2014  (Fig.3.).  From  the  45  articles  selected  on  “Learning 
Analytics”,  2  were  published  in  2010,  8  articles  in  2011,  20 
articles in 2012, 14 articles in 2013, 1 article in 2014 and none in 
2015  (Fig.4.).  As  Google  Scholar  searched  on  relevance  of  the 
article  based  on  frequency  of  views  and  citation,  articles  from 
2014  and  2015  were  not  listed  at  the  top  results  of  the  search, 
therefore not reviewed in this study.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization. 

5.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

the  annual 

Since  2011, 

International  Conference  on 
Educational  Data  Mining  (EDM)  and  the  annual  International 
Conference on  Learning  Analytics and Knowledge (LAK)  have 
seen  many  papers  submitted  and  presented  to  showcase  the 
emerging and  fast developing field of Educational Data Mining 
and Learning  Analytics (refer Fig.1.). The trend in the numbers 
of articles submitted/published in  the two journals in the past 5 
years clearly shows the growing interest in the field.

A  total  of  119  papers  have  been  submitted  in  the  recent 
international  conference  on  Educational  Data  Mining  held  in 
2014  which  shows  dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of  papers 
submitted when compared to the 103 and 51 papers submitted in 
the  same  conference  in  2013  and  2012  respectively.  The  graph 
shown below clearly shows the growth of research in this field.  

The  research  papers  submitted  in  EDM  2014  covered  a 
variety  of  topics  under  Education  Data  Mining  and  Big  Data. 
But around 54% of the submitted papers were addressing the top 
8 topics. 

5.1  MAJOR TOPICS OF INTEREST 

The major topics in which the researchers have concentrated 
in  the  EDM  2014  conference  are  listed  below  in  the  order  of

Fig.2. Popular Topics in EDM 2014 

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning 

There are also many articles  on learning analytics published 
in various journal such as Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal 
of  Educational  Technology  &  Society,  International  Review  of 
Research 
(IRRODL), 
International  Journal  of  Technology  Enhanced  Learning, 
International  Journal  of  E-Learning  and  Distance  Education 
(JDE),  Australasian  Journal  of  Educational  Technology, 
International  Journal  of  Learning  Technology  and  British 
Journal of Educational Technology 

However,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  we  only  review 
searched  literature  on  Google  Scholar  sorted  by  relevance 
relating to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. 

5.2  METHODS 

5.2.1  Data Collection: 

This  study  reviews  literature  chosen  with  the  primary  focus 
in  Educational  Data  Mining  and  Learning  Analytics  and  its 
implications  to  higher  education,  educational  technology  and 
instructional design.  

Google  Scholar  was  used  to  search  and  locate  academic 
papers  from  journals,  conference  proceedings  and  professional 
magazines  with  the  keywords  “educational  data  mining”  and 
“learning  analytics”.  The  search  period  was  set  from  2010  to 
2015  and  the  papers  reviewed  include  both  qualitative  and 
quantitative  studies  from  researchers  in  the  field  of  educational 

1038 

data mining and learning analytics worldwide. The search for the 
keywords  in  Google  Scholar  when  sorted  by  relevance  yielded 
the below results.

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  data  collection  process 
resulted in the identification of a total of 90 distinct articles. 45 
articles  were  selected  for  the  search  term  “Educational  Data 
Mining”  [15-59]  and  another  45  articles  were  selected  for  the 
search term “Learning Analytics” [11; 60-103]. From the search 
results, it can be seen that all these articles have been frequently 
cited by other  researchers.  As these articles are frequently  cited 
by  researchers,  they  can  be  selected  as  a  good  representative 
sample of the literature in the field. 

5.2.2  Data Classification/Analysis 

Articles were classified both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The  quantitative  analysis  was  used  to  classify  the  papers 
according  to  the  publication  year  and  the  type  of  publication  in 
which the articles appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified 
using  open  coded  content  analysis  whereby  each  paper  was 
reviewed to identify themes and trends in the literature. 

5.3  RESULTS 

5.3.1  Quantitative Details: 

From the 45 articles selected on “Educational Data Mining” , 
17 were published in 2010, 6 in 2011, 14 in 2012, 5 in 2013 and 
3  in  2014  (Fig.3.).  From  the  45  articles  selected  on  “Learning 
Analytics”,  2  were  published  in  2010,  8  articles  in  2011,  20 
articles in 2012, 14 articles in 2013, 1 article in 2014 and none in 
2015  (Fig.4.).  As  Google  Scholar  searched  on  relevance  of  the 
article  based  on  frequency  of  views  and  citation,  articles  from 
2014  and  2015  were  not  listed  at  the  top  results  of  the  search, 
therefore not reviewed in this study.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

                                                                   ICTACT JOURNAL ON SOFT COMPUTING:  
SPECIAL ISSUE ON SOFT COMPUTING MODELS FOR BIG DATA, JULY 2015, VOLUME: 05, ISSUE: 04 

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization.

A  total  of  119  papers  have  been  submitted  in  the  recent 
international  conference  on  Educational  Data  Mining  held  in 
2014  which  shows  dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of  papers 
submitted when compared to the 103 and 51 papers submitted in 
the  same  conference  in  2013  and  2012  respectively.  The  graph 
shown below clearly shows the growth of research in this field.  

The  research  papers  submitted  in  EDM  2014  covered  a 
variety  of  topics  under  Education  Data  Mining  and  Big  Data. 
But around 54% of the submitted papers were addressing the top 
8 topics.

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning 

There are also many articles  on learning analytics published 
in various journal such as Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal 
of  Educational  Technology  &  Society,  International  Review  of 
Research 
(IRRODL), 
International  Journal  of  Technology  Enhanced  Learning, 
International  Journal  of  E-Learning  and  Distance  Education 
(JDE),  Australasian  Journal  of  Educational  Technology, 
International  Journal  of  Learning  Technology  and  British 
Journal of Educational Technology 

However,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  we  only  review 
searched  literature  on  Google  Scholar  sorted  by  relevance 
relating to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. 

5.2  METHODS 

5.2.1  Data Collection: 

This  study  reviews  literature  chosen  with  the  primary  focus 
in  Educational  Data  Mining  and  Learning  Analytics  and  its 
implications  to  higher  education,  educational  technology  and 
instructional design.  

Google  Scholar  was  used  to  search  and  locate  academic 
papers  from  journals,  conference  proceedings  and  professional 
magazines  with  the  keywords  “educational  data  mining”  and 
“learning  analytics”.  The  search  period  was  set  from  2010  to 
2015  and  the  papers  reviewed  include  both  qualitative  and 
quantitative  studies  from  researchers  in  the  field  of  educational 

1038 

data mining and learning analytics worldwide. The search for the 
keywords  in  Google  Scholar  when  sorted  by  relevance  yielded 
the below results.

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  data  collection  process 
resulted in the identification of a total of 90 distinct articles. 45 
articles  were  selected  for  the  search  term  “Educational  Data 
Mining”  [15-59]  and  another  45  articles  were  selected  for  the 
search term “Learning Analytics” [11; 60-103]. From the search 
results, it can be seen that all these articles have been frequently 
cited by other  researchers.  As these articles are frequently  cited 
by  researchers,  they  can  be  selected  as  a  good  representative 
sample of the literature in the field. 

5.2.2  Data Classification/Analysis 

Articles were classified both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The  quantitative  analysis  was  used  to  classify  the  papers 
according  to  the  publication  year  and  the  type  of  publication  in 
which the articles appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified 
using  open  coded  content  analysis  whereby  each  paper  was 
reviewed to identify themes and trends in the literature. 

5.3  RESULTS 

5.3.1  Quantitative Details: 

From the 45 articles selected on “Educational Data Mining” , 
17 were published in 2010, 6 in 2011, 14 in 2012, 5 in 2013 and 
3  in  2014  (Fig.3.).  From  the  45  articles  selected  on  “Learning 
Analytics”,  2  were  published  in  2010,  8  articles  in  2011,  20 
articles in 2012, 14 articles in 2013, 1 article in 2014 and none in 
2015  (Fig.4.).  As  Google  Scholar  searched  on  relevance  of  the 
article  based  on  frequency  of  views  and  citation,  articles  from 
2014  and  2015  were  not  listed  at  the  top  results  of  the  search, 
therefore not reviewed in this study.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization. 

5.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

the  annual 

Since  2011, 

International  Conference  on 
Educational  Data  Mining  (EDM)  and  the  annual  International 
Conference on  Learning  Analytics and Knowledge (LAK)  have 
seen  many  papers  submitted  and  presented  to  showcase  the 
emerging and  fast developing field of Educational Data Mining 
and Learning  Analytics (refer Fig.1.). The trend in the numbers 
of articles submitted/published in  the two journals in the past 5 
years clearly shows the growing interest in the field.

A  total  of  119  papers  have  been  submitted  in  the  recent 
international  conference  on  Educational  Data  Mining  held  in 
2014  which  shows  dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of  papers 
submitted when compared to the 103 and 51 papers submitted in 
the  same  conference  in  2013  and  2012  respectively.  The  graph 
shown below clearly shows the growth of research in this field.  

The  research  papers  submitted  in  EDM  2014  covered  a 
variety  of  topics  under  Education  Data  Mining  and  Big  Data. 
But around 54% of the submitted papers were addressing the top 
8 topics.

Fig.2. Popular Topics in EDM 2014 

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning 

There are also many articles  on learning analytics published 
in various journal such as Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal 
of  Educational  Technology  &  Society,  International  Review  of 
Research 
(IRRODL), 
International  Journal  of  Technology  Enhanced  Learning, 
International  Journal  of  E-Learning  and  Distance  Education 
(JDE),  Australasian  Journal  of  Educational  Technology, 
International  Journal  of  Learning  Technology  and  British 
Journal of Educational Technology 

However,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  we  only  review 
searched  literature  on  Google  Scholar  sorted  by  relevance 
relating to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. 

5.2  METHODS 

5.2.1  Data Collection: 

This  study  reviews  literature  chosen  with  the  primary  focus 
in  Educational  Data  Mining  and  Learning  Analytics  and  its 
implications  to  higher  education,  educational  technology  and 
instructional design.  

Google  Scholar  was  used  to  search  and  locate  academic 
papers  from  journals,  conference  proceedings  and  professional 
magazines  with  the  keywords  “educational  data  mining”  and 
“learning  analytics”.  The  search  period  was  set  from  2010  to 
2015  and  the  papers  reviewed  include  both  qualitative  and 
quantitative  studies  from  researchers  in  the  field  of  educational 

1038 

data mining and learning analytics worldwide. The search for the 
keywords  in  Google  Scholar  when  sorted  by  relevance  yielded 
the below results.

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  data  collection  process 
resulted in the identification of a total of 90 distinct articles. 45 
articles  were  selected  for  the  search  term  “Educational  Data 
Mining”  [15-59]  and  another  45  articles  were  selected  for  the 
search term “Learning Analytics” [11; 60-103]. From the search 
results, it can be seen that all these articles have been frequently 
cited by other  researchers.  As these articles are frequently  cited 
by  researchers,  they  can  be  selected  as  a  good  representative 
sample of the literature in the field. 

5.2.2  Data Classification/Analysis 

Articles were classified both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The  quantitative  analysis  was  used  to  classify  the  papers 
according  to  the  publication  year  and  the  type  of  publication  in 
which the articles appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified 
using  open  coded  content  analysis  whereby  each  paper  was 
reviewed to identify themes and trends in the literature. 

5.3  RESULTS 

5.3.1  Quantitative Details: 

From the 45 articles selected on “Educational Data Mining” , 
17 were published in 2010, 6 in 2011, 14 in 2012, 5 in 2013 and 
3  in  2014  (Fig.3.).  From  the  45  articles  selected  on  “Learning 
Analytics”,  2  were  published  in  2010,  8  articles  in  2011,  20 
articles in 2012, 14 articles in 2013, 1 article in 2014 and none in 
2015  (Fig.4.).  As  Google  Scholar  searched  on  relevance  of  the 
article  based  on  frequency  of  views  and  citation,  articles  from 
2014  and  2015  were  not  listed  at  the  top  results  of  the  search, 
therefore not reviewed in this study.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization.

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization.

A  total  of  119  papers  have  been  submitted  in  the  recent 
international  conference  on  Educational  Data  Mining  held  in 
2014  which  shows  dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of  papers 
submitted when compared to the 103 and 51 papers submitted in 
the  same  conference  in  2013  and  2012  respectively.  The  graph 
shown below clearly shows the growth of research in this field.  

The  research  papers  submitted  in  EDM  2014  covered  a 
variety  of  topics  under  Education  Data  Mining  and  Big  Data. 
But around 54% of the submitted papers were addressing the top 
8 topics.

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning 

There are also many articles  on learning analytics published 
in various journal such as Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal 
of  Educational  Technology  &  Society,  International  Review  of 
Research 
(IRRODL), 
International  Journal  of  Technology  Enhanced  Learning, 
International  Journal  of  E-Learning  and  Distance  Education 
(JDE),  Australasian  Journal  of  Educational  Technology, 
International  Journal  of  Learning  Technology  and  British 
Journal of Educational Technology 

However,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  we  only  review 
searched  literature  on  Google  Scholar  sorted  by  relevance 
relating to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. 

5.2  METHODS 

5.2.1  Data Collection: 

This  study  reviews  literature  chosen  with  the  primary  focus 
in  Educational  Data  Mining  and  Learning  Analytics  and  its 
implications  to  higher  education,  educational  technology  and 
instructional design.  

Google  Scholar  was  used  to  search  and  locate  academic 
papers  from  journals,  conference  proceedings  and  professional 
magazines  with  the  keywords  “educational  data  mining”  and 
“learning  analytics”.  The  search  period  was  set  from  2010  to 
2015  and  the  papers  reviewed  include  both  qualitative  and 
quantitative  studies  from  researchers  in  the  field  of  educational

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  data  collection  process 
resulted in the identification of a total of 90 distinct articles. 45 
articles  were  selected  for  the  search  term  “Educational  Data 
Mining”  [15-59]  and  another  45  articles  were  selected  for  the 
search term “Learning Analytics” [11; 60-103]. From the search 
results, it can be seen that all these articles have been frequently 
cited by other  researchers.  As these articles are frequently  cited 
by  researchers,  they  can  be  selected  as  a  good  representative 
sample of the literature in the field. 

5.2.2  Data Classification/Analysis 

Articles were classified both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The  quantitative  analysis  was  used  to  classify  the  papers 
according  to  the  publication  year  and  the  type  of  publication  in 
which the articles appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified 
using  open  coded  content  analysis  whereby  each  paper  was 
reviewed to identify themes and trends in the literature. 

5.3  RESULTS 

5.3.1  Quantitative Details: 

From the 45 articles selected on “Educational Data Mining” , 
17 were published in 2010, 6 in 2011, 14 in 2012, 5 in 2013 and 
3  in  2014  (Fig.3.).  From  the  45  articles  selected  on  “Learning 
Analytics”,  2  were  published  in  2010,  8  articles  in  2011,  20 
articles in 2012, 14 articles in 2013, 1 article in 2014 and none in 
2015  (Fig.4.).  As  Google  Scholar  searched  on  relevance  of  the 
article  based  on  frequency  of  views  and  citation,  articles  from 
2014  and  2015  were  not  listed  at  the  top  results  of  the  search, 
therefore not reviewed in this study.

5.4  LIMITATIONS 

Due to time constraint, only 90 articles were reviewed, which 
represents  only  1%  of  the  search  results  for  the  terms 
“Educational Data Mining” and “Learning Analytics” in Google 
Scholar.  Also  due  to  Google  Scholar  search  algorithm,  articles 
from year 2014 and 2015 were not listed at the top of the search 
results, thus not selected for the review in this study. 

Another  limitation  is  that  articles  published  in  languages 
other  than  English  were  not  considered  for  this  review.  As  the 
search  was  conducted  only  on  Google  Scholar,  articles  from 
journals and academic databases were also not included. 

5.5  DISCUSSION 

The growth in the emerging fields of educational data mining 
and  learning  analytics  can  be  seen  from  the  availability  of 
literature from 2010 until present. In the 45 articles selected for 
review  in  “Educational  Data  Mining”,  18  were  focusing  on 
exploring  the  ways  in  which  the  data  mining  techniques  can  be 
applied in education, while another 18 focused on evaluating or 
predicting  student's  performance.  A  few  articles  focused  on 
specific  data  mining  algorithms  and  pedagogical  analysis.  This 
clearly  shows  that  researchers  are  focusing  mainly  on  the  top 
two  themes,  the  application  of  data  mining  techniques  in 
education  and  prediction  of  student  performance.  The  4  themes 
were  selected  as  they  clearly  distinguish  the  articles  into  4 
groups and help identify the theme most used by the researchers. 

Even  though  only  45  articles  on  “Learning  Analytics”  were 
reviewed in this study, it can be seen from the theme categories 
that  researchers  are  focusing  their  efforts  on  3  major  trends  in 
the field of learning analytics. 

First,  there  are  articles  focusing  on  the  development  of 
academic  analytics,  and  introduction  of  learning  analytics,  its 
concepts,  implications  and  impact  to  higher  education  and  e-
learning,  the  importance  of  aligning  with  pedagogy,  learning 
theory  and  design  and  the  research  frameworks  and  ethics 
policies.  

Second,  from  the  technical  view  point,  researchers  are 
looking  at  educational  data  mining  and  the  use  of  datasets  to 
improve  learning  analytics,  especially  through  communication 
and collaboration between educational data mining and learning 
analytics  communities.  To  help  teachers  and  students  visualise 
learning  traces,  researchers  are  designing  and  developing 
frameworks  and  dashboards  for  information  visualization.  The 
use of learning analytics in assessments enabling automated, real 
time  feedback  using  multiple  modalities  and  videogames  to 
students, will impact student performance and success.  

Third,  the  use  of  learning  analytics  in  social  learning  and 
MOOCs. Learners build knowledge together in their cultural and 
forums, 
social  settings 
synchronous 
the 
constructivist learning theory. 

through  discourse, 

from  online 

supporting 

text 

to 

social  networks, 

The  study  also  revealed  less  number  of  articles  focusing  on 
evaluating learning outcomes by analyzing natural language text.  
Researchers  can  focus  on  predicting  student  performance  in 
learning  environments  where  students  interact  through  forums. 
As  essay  answers  and  forum  content  are  currently  manually

evaluated by teachers, it has greater scope for the application of 
big data techniques in the future.  

6.  CONCLUSION 

As  the  data  involved  in  education  becomes  larger,  the 
applications  of  Big  Data  techniques  become  more  and  more 
necessary in learning environments. MOOCs are good examples 
of  learning  environments  that  were  resource  hungry  and  raised 
the  need  for  data  mining  in  education.  The  recent  trends  in  the 
published papers in EDM indicate the growth in data mining in 
education  field.  Apart  from  EDM  which  we  saw  in  this  study, 
other  communities  are  also  involved  in  researching  this  field. 
Exploring those communities will provide greater insights in the 
field.  Educational  Data  Mining  is  sure  to  reshape  the  way  in 
which the forthcoming generations would learn. 

This  study  revealed  two  major  trends  from  articles  located 
from  top  45  search  results  of  a  Google  scholar  search  on 
“Educational  Data  Mining”.  The  articles  were  mainly  from 
journals  and  conferences  related  to  Educational  Data  Mining. 
The major trends were identified as “Introduction to the concepts 
of  applying  Data  Mining  in  Education”  and  “Prediction  or 
measurement  of  Student  Performance  using  Data  Mining”.  As 
the  former 
involved  articles  on  performance 
prediction,  we  can  conclude  that  the  biggest  focus  is  on 
“Performance Prediction using Data Mining”. 

trend  also 

This  study  also  highlighted  3  major  trends  and  10  themes 
from articles located from the top 45 search results of a Google 
Scholar  search  on  “Learning  Analytics”.  The  articles  were 
mainly  from  Educational  Technology  journals  and  conference 
proceedings. There were 22 articles on the first trend of articles 
introducing the concept and development of the field of learning 
analytics  to  higher  education  and  e-learning,  17  articles  on  the 
second  trend  of  technical  development  of  learning  analytics 
framework and tools, and 6 articles on the third trend of learning 
analytics use in social learning.  

As  this  study  has  reviewed  only  a  tiny  portion  of  the 
available articles, there remains a need for a systematic study of 
published  literature  on  the  fast  growing  field  of  application  of 
big data in education and learning.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization. 

5.  LITERATURE REVIEW

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning 

There are also many articles  on learning analytics published 
in various journal such as Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal 
of  Educational  Technology  &  Society,  International  Review  of 
Research 
(IRRODL), 
International  Journal  of  Technology  Enhanced  Learning, 
International  Journal  of  E-Learning  and  Distance  Education 
(JDE),  Australasian  Journal  of  Educational  Technology, 
International  Journal  of  Learning  Technology  and  British

However,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  we  only  review 
searched  literature  on  Google  Scholar  sorted  by  relevance 
relating to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. 

5.2  METHODS 

5.2.1  Data Collection: 

This  study  reviews  literature  chosen  with  the  primary  focus 
in  Educational  Data  Mining  and  Learning  Analytics  and  its 
implications  to  higher  education,  educational  technology  and 
instructional design.  

Google  Scholar  was  used  to  search  and  locate  academic 
papers  from  journals,  conference  proceedings  and  professional 
magazines  with  the  keywords  “educational  data  mining”  and 
“learning  analytics”.  The  search  period  was  set  from  2010  to 
2015  and  the  papers  reviewed  include  both  qualitative  and 
quantitative  studies  from  researchers  in  the  field  of  educational

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  data  collection  process 
resulted in the identification of a total of 90 distinct articles. 45 
articles  were  selected  for  the  search  term  “Educational  Data 
Mining”  [15-59]  and  another  45  articles  were  selected  for  the 
search term “Learning Analytics” [11; 60-103]. From the search 
results, it can be seen that all these articles have been frequently 
cited by other  researchers.  As these articles are frequently  cited 
by  researchers,  they  can  be  selected  as  a  good  representative 
sample of the literature in the field. 

5.2.2  Data Classification/Analysis 

Articles were classified both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The  quantitative  analysis  was  used  to  classify  the  papers 
according  to  the  publication  year  and  the  type  of  publication  in 
which the articles appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified 
using  open  coded  content  analysis  whereby  each  paper  was 
reviewed to identify themes and trends in the literature. 

5.3  RESULTS 

5.3.1  Quantitative Details: 

From the 45 articles selected on “Educational Data Mining” , 
17 were published in 2010, 6 in 2011, 14 in 2012, 5 in 2013 and 
3  in  2014  (Fig.3.).  From  the  45  articles  selected  on  “Learning 
Analytics”,  2  were  published  in  2010,  8  articles  in  2011,  20 
articles in 2012, 14 articles in 2013, 1 article in 2014 and none in 
2015  (Fig.4.).  As  Google  Scholar  searched  on  relevance  of  the 
article  based  on  frequency  of  views  and  citation,  articles  from 
2014  and  2015  were  not  listed  at  the  top  results  of  the  search, 
therefore not reviewed in this study.

5.4  LIMITATIONS 

Due to time constraint, only 90 articles were reviewed, which 
represents  only  1%  of  the  search  results  for  the  terms 
“Educational Data Mining” and “Learning Analytics” in Google 
Scholar.  Also  due  to  Google  Scholar  search  algorithm,  articles 
from year 2014 and 2015 were not listed at the top of the search 
results, thus not selected for the review in this study. 

Another  limitation  is  that  articles  published  in  languages 
other  than  English  were  not  considered  for  this  review.  As  the 
search  was  conducted  only  on  Google  Scholar,  articles  from 
journals and academic databases were also not included. 

5.5  DISCUSSION 

The growth in the emerging fields of educational data mining 
and  learning  analytics  can  be  seen  from  the  availability  of 
literature from 2010 until present. In the 45 articles selected for 
review  in  “Educational  Data  Mining”,  18  were  focusing  on 
exploring  the  ways  in  which  the  data  mining  techniques  can  be 
applied in education, while another 18 focused on evaluating or 
predicting  student's  performance.  A  few  articles  focused  on 
specific  data  mining  algorithms  and  pedagogical  analysis.  This 
clearly  shows  that  researchers  are  focusing  mainly  on  the  top 
two  themes,  the  application  of  data  mining  techniques  in 
education  and  prediction  of  student  performance.  The  4  themes 
were  selected  as  they  clearly  distinguish  the  articles  into  4 
groups and help identify the theme most used by the researchers. 

Even  though  only  45  articles  on  “Learning  Analytics”  were 
reviewed in this study, it can be seen from the theme categories 
that  researchers  are  focusing  their  efforts  on  3  major  trends  in 
the field of learning analytics. 

First,  there  are  articles  focusing  on  the  development  of 
academic  analytics,  and  introduction  of  learning  analytics,  its 
concepts,  implications  and  impact  to  higher  education  and  e-
learning,  the  importance  of  aligning  with  pedagogy,  learning 
theory  and  design  and  the  research  frameworks  and  ethics 
policies.  

Second,  from  the  technical  view  point,  researchers  are 
looking  at  educational  data  mining  and  the  use  of  datasets  to 
improve  learning  analytics,  especially  through  communication 
and collaboration between educational data mining and learning 
analytics  communities.  To  help  teachers  and  students  visualise 
learning  traces,  researchers  are  designing  and  developing 
frameworks  and  dashboards  for  information  visualization.  The 
use of learning analytics in assessments enabling automated, real 
time  feedback  using  multiple  modalities  and  videogames  to 
students, will impact student performance and success.  

Third,  the  use  of  learning  analytics  in  social  learning  and 
MOOCs. Learners build knowledge together in their cultural and 
forums,

evaluated by teachers, it has greater scope for the application of 
big data techniques in the future.  

6.  CONCLUSION 

As  the  data  involved  in  education  becomes  larger,  the 
applications  of  Big  Data  techniques  become  more  and  more 
necessary in learning environments. MOOCs are good examples 
of  learning  environments  that  were  resource  hungry  and  raised 
the  need  for  data  mining  in  education.  The  recent  trends  in  the 
published papers in EDM indicate the growth in data mining in 
education  field.  Apart  from  EDM  which  we  saw  in  this  study, 
other  communities  are  also  involved  in  researching  this  field. 
Exploring those communities will provide greater insights in the 
field.  Educational  Data  Mining  is  sure  to  reshape  the  way  in 
which the forthcoming generations would learn. 

This  study  revealed  two  major  trends  from  articles  located 
from  top  45  search  results  of  a  Google  scholar  search  on 
“Educational  Data  Mining”.  The  articles  were  mainly  from 
journals  and  conferences  related  to  Educational  Data  Mining. 
The major trends were identified as “Introduction to the concepts 
of  applying  Data  Mining  in  Education”  and  “Prediction  or 
measurement  of  Student  Performance  using  Data  Mining”.  As 
the  former 
involved  articles  on  performance 
prediction,  we  can  conclude  that  the  biggest  focus  is  on 
“Performance Prediction using Data Mining”. 

trend  also 

This  study  also  highlighted  3  major  trends  and  10  themes 
from articles located from the top 45 search results of a Google 
Scholar  search  on  “Learning  Analytics”.  The  articles  were 
mainly  from  Educational  Technology  journals  and  conference 
proceedings. There were 22 articles on the first trend of articles 
introducing the concept and development of the field of learning 
analytics  to  higher  education  and  e-learning,  17  articles  on  the 
second  trend  of  technical  development  of  learning  analytics 
framework and tools, and 6 articles on the third trend of learning 
analytics use in social learning.  

As  this  study  has  reviewed  only  a  tiny  portion  of  the 
available articles, there remains a need for a systematic study of 
published  literature  on  the  fast  growing  field  of  application  of 
big data in education and learning.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization. 

5.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

the  annual 

Since  2011, 

International  Conference  on 
Educational  Data  Mining  (EDM)  and  the  annual  International 
Conference on  Learning  Analytics and Knowledge (LAK)  have 
seen  many  papers  submitted  and  presented  to  showcase  the 
emerging and  fast developing field of Educational Data Mining 
and Learning  Analytics (refer Fig.1.). The trend in the numbers 
of articles submitted/published in  the two journals in the past 5 
years clearly shows the growing interest in the field.

A  total  of  119  papers  have  been  submitted  in  the  recent 
international  conference  on  Educational  Data  Mining  held  in 
2014  which  shows  dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of  papers 
submitted when compared to the 103 and 51 papers submitted in 
the  same  conference  in  2013  and  2012  respectively.  The  graph 
shown below clearly shows the growth of research in this field.  

The  research  papers  submitted  in  EDM  2014  covered  a 
variety  of  topics  under  Education  Data  Mining  and  Big  Data. 
But around 54% of the submitted papers were addressing the top 
8 topics.

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning 

There are also many articles  on learning analytics published 
in various journal such as Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal 
of  Educational  Technology  &  Society,  International  Review  of 
Research 
(IRRODL), 
International  Journal  of  Technology  Enhanced  Learning, 
International  Journal  of  E-Learning  and  Distance  Education 
(JDE),  Australasian  Journal  of  Educational  Technology, 
International  Journal  of  Learning  Technology  and  British 
Journal of Educational Technology 

However,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  we  only  review 
searched  literature  on  Google  Scholar  sorted  by  relevance 
relating to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. 

5.2  METHODS 

5.2.1  Data Collection: 

This  study  reviews  literature  chosen  with  the  primary  focus 
in  Educational  Data  Mining  and  Learning  Analytics  and  its 
implications  to  higher  education,  educational  technology  and 
instructional design.  

Google  Scholar  was  used  to  search  and  locate  academic 
papers  from  journals,  conference  proceedings  and  professional 
magazines  with  the  keywords  “educational  data  mining”  and 
“learning  analytics”.  The  search  period  was  set  from  2010  to 
2015  and  the  papers  reviewed  include  both  qualitative  and 
quantitative  studies  from  researchers  in  the  field  of  educational 

1038 

data mining and learning analytics worldwide. The search for the 
keywords  in  Google  Scholar  when  sorted  by  relevance  yielded 
the below results.

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  data  collection  process 
resulted in the identification of a total of 90 distinct articles. 45 
articles  were  selected  for  the  search  term  “Educational  Data 
Mining”  [15-59]  and  another  45  articles  were  selected  for  the 
search term “Learning Analytics” [11; 60-103]. From the search 
results, it can be seen that all these articles have been frequently 
cited by other  researchers.  As these articles are frequently  cited 
by  researchers,  they  can  be  selected  as  a  good  representative 
sample of the literature in the field. 

5.2.2  Data Classification/Analysis 

Articles were classified both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The  quantitative  analysis  was  used  to  classify  the  papers 
according  to  the  publication  year  and  the  type  of  publication  in 
which the articles appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified 
using  open  coded  content  analysis  whereby  each  paper  was 
reviewed to identify themes and trends in the literature. 

5.3  RESULTS 

5.3.1  Quantitative Details: 

From the 45 articles selected on “Educational Data Mining” , 
17 were published in 2010, 6 in 2011, 14 in 2012, 5 in 2013 and 
3  in  2014  (Fig.3.).  From  the  45  articles  selected  on  “Learning 
Analytics”,  2  were  published  in  2010,  8  articles  in  2011,  20 
articles in 2012, 14 articles in 2013, 1 article in 2014 and none in 
2015  (Fig.4.).  As  Google  Scholar  searched  on  relevance  of  the 
article  based  on  frequency  of  views  and  citation,  articles  from 
2014  and  2015  were  not  listed  at  the  top  results  of  the  search, 
therefore not reviewed in this study.

5.4  LIMITATIONS 

Due to time constraint, only 90 articles were reviewed, which 
represents  only  1%  of  the  search  results  for  the  terms 
“Educational Data Mining” and “Learning Analytics” in Google 
Scholar.  Also  due  to  Google  Scholar  search  algorithm,  articles 
from year 2014 and 2015 were not listed at the top of the search 
results, thus not selected for the review in this study. 

Another  limitation  is  that  articles  published  in  languages 
other  than  English  were  not  considered  for  this  review.  As  the 
search  was  conducted  only  on  Google  Scholar,  articles  from 
journals and academic databases were also not included. 

5.5  DISCUSSION 

The growth in the emerging fields of educational data mining 
and  learning  analytics  can  be  seen  from  the  availability  of 
literature from 2010 until present. In the 45 articles selected for 
review  in  “Educational  Data  Mining”,  18  were  focusing  on 
exploring  the  ways  in  which  the  data  mining  techniques  can  be 
applied in education, while another 18 focused on evaluating or 
predicting  student's  performance.  A  few  articles  focused  on 
specific  data  mining  algorithms  and  pedagogical  analysis.  This 
clearly  shows  that  researchers  are  focusing  mainly  on  the  top 
two  themes,  the  application  of  data  mining  techniques  in 
education  and  prediction  of  student  performance.  The  4  themes 
were  selected  as  they  clearly  distinguish  the  articles  into  4 
groups and help identify the theme most used by the researchers. 

Even  though  only  45  articles  on  “Learning  Analytics”  were 
reviewed in this study, it can be seen from the theme categories 
that  researchers  are  focusing  their  efforts  on  3  major  trends  in 
the field of learning analytics. 

First,  there  are  articles  focusing  on  the  development  of 
academic  analytics,  and  introduction  of  learning  analytics,  its 
concepts,  implications  and  impact  to  higher  education  and  e-
learning,  the  importance  of  aligning  with  pedagogy,  learning 
theory  and  design  and  the  research  frameworks  and  ethics 
policies.  

Second,  from  the  technical  view  point,  researchers  are 
looking  at  educational  data  mining  and  the  use  of  datasets  to 
improve  learning  analytics,  especially  through  communication 
and collaboration between educational data mining and learning 
analytics  communities.  To  help  teachers  and  students  visualise 
learning  traces,  researchers  are  designing  and  developing 
frameworks  and  dashboards  for  information  visualization.  The 
use of learning analytics in assessments enabling automated, real 
time  feedback  using  multiple  modalities  and  videogames  to 
students, will impact student performance and success.  

Third,  the  use  of  learning  analytics  in  social  learning  and 
MOOCs. Learners build knowledge together in their cultural and 
forums,

The  study  also  revealed  less  number  of  articles  focusing  on 
evaluating learning outcomes by analyzing natural language text.  
Researchers  can  focus  on  predicting  student  performance  in 
learning  environments  where  students  interact  through  forums.

evaluated by teachers, it has greater scope for the application of 
big data techniques in the future.  

6.  CONCLUSION 

As  the  data  involved  in  education  becomes  larger,  the 
applications  of  Big  Data  techniques  become  more  and  more 
necessary in learning environments. MOOCs are good examples 
of  learning  environments  that  were  resource  hungry  and  raised 
the  need  for  data  mining  in  education.  The  recent  trends  in  the 
published papers in EDM indicate the growth in data mining in 
education  field.  Apart  from  EDM  which  we  saw  in  this  study, 
other  communities  are  also  involved  in  researching  this  field. 
Exploring those communities will provide greater insights in the 
field.  Educational  Data  Mining  is  sure  to  reshape  the  way  in 
which the forthcoming generations would learn. 

This  study  revealed  two  major  trends  from  articles  located 
from  top  45  search  results  of  a  Google  scholar  search  on 
“Educational  Data  Mining”.  The  articles  were  mainly  from 
journals  and  conferences  related  to  Educational  Data  Mining. 
The major trends were identified as “Introduction to the concepts 
of  applying  Data  Mining  in  Education”  and  “Prediction  or 
measurement  of  Student  Performance  using  Data  Mining”.  As 
the  former 
involved  articles  on  performance 
prediction,  we  can  conclude  that  the  biggest  focus  is  on 
“Performance Prediction using Data Mining”. 

trend  also 

This  study  also  highlighted  3  major  trends  and  10  themes 
from articles located from the top 45 search results of a Google 
Scholar  search  on  “Learning  Analytics”.  The  articles  were 
mainly  from  Educational  Technology  journals  and  conference 
proceedings. There were 22 articles on the first trend of articles 
introducing the concept and development of the field of learning 
analytics  to  higher  education  and  e-learning,  17  articles  on  the 
second  trend  of  technical  development  of  learning  analytics 
framework and tools, and 6 articles on the third trend of learning 
analytics use in social learning.  

As  this  study  has  reviewed  only  a  tiny  portion  of  the 
available articles, there remains a need for a systematic study of 
published  literature  on  the  fast  growing  field  of  application  of 
big data in education and learning.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

                                                                   ICTACT JOURNAL ON SOFT COMPUTING:

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization.

Fig.2. Popular Topics in EDM 2014 

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning 

There are also many articles  on learning analytics published 
in various journal such as Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal 
of  Educational  Technology  &  Society,  International  Review  of 
Research 
(IRRODL), 
International  Journal  of  Technology  Enhanced  Learning, 
International  Journal  of  E-Learning  and  Distance  Education 
(JDE),  Australasian  Journal  of  Educational  Technology, 
International  Journal  of  Learning  Technology  and  British 
Journal of Educational Technology 

However,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  we  only  review 
searched  literature  on  Google  Scholar  sorted  by  relevance 
relating to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. 

5.2  METHODS 

5.2.1  Data Collection: 

This  study  reviews  literature  chosen  with  the  primary  focus 
in  Educational  Data  Mining  and  Learning  Analytics  and  its 
implications  to  higher  education,  educational  technology  and 
instructional design.  

Google  Scholar  was  used  to  search  and  locate  academic 
papers  from  journals,  conference  proceedings  and  professional 
magazines  with  the  keywords  “educational  data  mining”  and 
“learning  analytics”.  The  search  period  was  set  from  2010  to 
2015  and  the  papers  reviewed  include  both  qualitative  and 
quantitative  studies  from  researchers  in  the  field  of  educational 

1038 

data mining and learning analytics worldwide. The search for the 
keywords  in  Google  Scholar  when  sorted  by  relevance  yielded 
the below results.

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  data  collection  process 
resulted in the identification of a total of 90 distinct articles. 45 
articles  were  selected  for  the  search  term  “Educational  Data 
Mining”  [15-59]  and  another  45  articles  were  selected  for  the 
search term “Learning Analytics” [11; 60-103]. From the search 
results, it can be seen that all these articles have been frequently 
cited by other  researchers.  As these articles are frequently  cited 
by  researchers,  they  can  be  selected  as  a  good  representative 
sample of the literature in the field. 

5.2.2  Data Classification/Analysis 

Articles were classified both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The  quantitative  analysis  was  used  to  classify  the  papers 
according  to  the  publication  year  and  the  type  of  publication  in 
which the articles appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified 
using  open  coded  content  analysis  whereby  each  paper  was 
reviewed to identify themes and trends in the literature. 

5.3  RESULTS 

5.3.1  Quantitative Details: 

From the 45 articles selected on “Educational Data Mining” , 
17 were published in 2010, 6 in 2011, 14 in 2012, 5 in 2013 and 
3  in  2014  (Fig.3.).  From  the  45  articles  selected  on  “Learning 
Analytics”,  2  were  published  in  2010,  8  articles  in  2011,  20 
articles in 2012, 14 articles in 2013, 1 article in 2014 and none in 
2015  (Fig.4.).  As  Google  Scholar  searched  on  relevance  of  the 
article  based  on  frequency  of  views  and  citation,  articles  from 
2014  and  2015  were  not  listed  at  the  top  results  of  the  search, 
therefore not reviewed in this study.

5.4  LIMITATIONS 

Due to time constraint, only 90 articles were reviewed, which 
represents  only  1%  of  the  search  results  for  the  terms 
“Educational Data Mining” and “Learning Analytics” in Google 
Scholar.  Also  due  to  Google  Scholar  search  algorithm,  articles 
from year 2014 and 2015 were not listed at the top of the search 
results, thus not selected for the review in this study. 

Another  limitation  is  that  articles  published  in  languages 
other  than  English  were  not  considered  for  this  review.  As  the 
search  was  conducted  only  on  Google  Scholar,  articles  from 
journals and academic databases were also not included. 

5.5  DISCUSSION 

The growth in the emerging fields of educational data mining 
and  learning  analytics  can  be  seen  from  the  availability  of 
literature from 2010 until present. In the 45 articles selected for 
review  in  “Educational  Data  Mining”,  18  were  focusing  on 
exploring  the  ways  in  which  the  data  mining  techniques  can  be 
applied in education, while another 18 focused on evaluating or 
predicting  student's  performance.  A  few  articles  focused  on 
specific  data  mining  algorithms  and  pedagogical  analysis.  This 
clearly  shows  that  researchers  are  focusing  mainly  on  the  top 
two  themes,  the  application  of  data  mining  techniques  in 
education  and  prediction  of  student  performance.  The  4  themes 
were  selected  as  they  clearly  distinguish  the  articles  into  4 
groups and help identify the theme most used by the researchers. 

Even  though  only  45  articles  on  “Learning  Analytics”  were 
reviewed in this study, it can be seen from the theme categories 
that  researchers  are  focusing  their  efforts  on  3  major  trends  in 
the field of learning analytics. 

First,  there  are  articles  focusing  on  the  development  of 
academic  analytics,  and  introduction  of  learning  analytics,  its 
concepts,  implications  and  impact  to  higher  education  and  e-
learning,  the  importance  of  aligning  with  pedagogy,  learning 
theory  and  design  and  the  research  frameworks  and  ethics 
policies.  

Second,  from  the  technical  view  point,  researchers  are 
looking  at  educational  data  mining  and  the  use  of  datasets  to 
improve  learning  analytics,  especially  through  communication 
and collaboration between educational data mining and learning 
analytics  communities.  To  help  teachers  and  students  visualise 
learning  traces,  researchers  are  designing  and  developing 
frameworks  and  dashboards  for  information  visualization.  The 
use of learning analytics in assessments enabling automated, real 
time  feedback  using  multiple  modalities  and  videogames  to 
students, will impact student performance and success.  

Third,  the  use  of  learning  analytics  in  social  learning  and 
MOOCs. Learners build knowledge together in their cultural and 
forums,

The  study  also  revealed  less  number  of  articles  focusing  on 
evaluating learning outcomes by analyzing natural language text.  
Researchers  can  focus  on  predicting  student  performance  in 
learning  environments  where  students  interact  through  forums.

evaluated by teachers, it has greater scope for the application of 
big data techniques in the future.  

6.  CONCLUSION 

As  the  data  involved  in  education  becomes  larger,  the 
applications  of  Big  Data  techniques  become  more  and  more 
necessary in learning environments. MOOCs are good examples 
of  learning  environments  that  were  resource  hungry  and  raised 
the  need  for  data  mining  in  education.  The  recent  trends  in  the 
published papers in EDM indicate the growth in data mining in 
education  field.  Apart  from  EDM  which  we  saw  in  this  study, 
other  communities  are  also  involved  in  researching  this  field. 
Exploring those communities will provide greater insights in the 
field.  Educational  Data  Mining  is  sure  to  reshape  the  way  in 
which the forthcoming generations would learn. 

This  study  revealed  two  major  trends  from  articles  located 
from  top  45  search  results  of  a  Google  scholar  search  on 
“Educational  Data  Mining”.  The  articles  were  mainly  from 
journals  and  conferences  related  to  Educational  Data  Mining. 
The major trends were identified as “Introduction to the concepts 
of  applying  Data  Mining  in  Education”  and  “Prediction  or 
measurement  of  Student  Performance  using  Data  Mining”.  As 
the  former 
involved  articles  on  performance 
prediction,  we  can  conclude  that  the  biggest  focus  is  on 
“Performance Prediction using Data Mining”. 

trend  also 

This  study  also  highlighted  3  major  trends  and  10  themes 
from articles located from the top 45 search results of a Google 
Scholar  search  on  “Learning  Analytics”.  The  articles  were 
mainly  from  Educational  Technology  journals  and  conference 
proceedings. There were 22 articles on the first trend of articles 
introducing the concept and development of the field of learning 
analytics  to  higher  education  and  e-learning,  17  articles  on  the 
second  trend  of  technical  development  of  learning  analytics 
framework and tools, and 6 articles on the third trend of learning 
analytics use in social learning.  

As  this  study  has  reviewed  only  a  tiny  portion  of  the 
available articles, there remains a need for a systematic study of 
published  literature  on  the  fast  growing  field  of  application  of 
big data in education and learning.

Abstract 

The  usage  of  learning  management  systems  in  education  has  been 
increasing  in  the  last  few  years.  Students  have  started  using  mobile 
phones, primarily smart phones that have become a part of their daily 
life,  to  access  online  content.  Student's  online  activities  generate 
enormous  amount  of  unused  data  that  are  wasted  as  traditional 
learning  analytics  are  not  capable  of  processing  them.  This  has 
resulted  in  the  penetration  of  Big  Data  technologies  and  tools  into 
education,  to  process  the  large  amount  of  data  involved.  This  study 
looks  into  the  recent  applications  of  Big  Data  technologies  in 
education and presents a review of literature available on Educational 
Data Mining and Learning Analytics.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Learning that initially started in the class room was based on 
three  models  namely  behavioral,  cognitive  and  constructivist 
models [2] The behavioral models rely on observable changes in 
the  behavior  of  the  student  to  assess  the  learning  outcome.  The 
cognitive models are based on the active involvement of teacher 
in  the 
learning  which  helps  in  guided  learning.  In  the 
constructivist  models,  the  students  have  to  learn  on  their  own 
from the knowledge available to them. 

Siemens  (2004)  [4]  proposed  a  new  model 

termed 
“Connectivism”  which  was  characterized  as  the  “amplification 
of learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension 
of  personal  network”.  According  to  this  model,  learning  is  no 
longer an internal activity [5] Connectivism proposed learning in 
a  network  of  nodes  which  improved  the  learning  experience  of 
students  and  reduced  the  need  for  the  direct  involvement  of  an 
instructor.  Since  then,  traditional  learning  environments  have 
gradually mutated into community based learning environments. 

2.  EMERGENCE OF BIG DATA IN LEARNING 

resulted 

in  education  has 
improvements.  Community  based 

in  several  new 
Research 
pedagogical 
learning 
environments  have increased  in  number. In the current learning 
environments, users learn in online communities like discussion 
forums,  online  chats,  instant  messaging  clients  and  various 
Learning  Management  Systems  like  Moodle.  Recent  learning 
methods  like  Flipped  Classroom  [6]  greatly  depend  on  online 
activities.  Several  frameworks  [7]  and  models  have  been 
proposed  for  online  learning  management  systems  to  improve 
the learning experience. Entry of open source projects in mobile 
computing  has  led  to  low  cost  smartphones  and  smartphones 

have penetrated much. Students have started using smart phones 
to  access  learning  content.  As  the  learning  environments  have 
become  accessible  anywhere  through  the  internet,  students 
access their courses anywhere and indulge in learning activities. 
Students’ activities through learning management systems create 
large  amount  of  data  that  can  be  utilized  in  developing  the 
learning  environment,  helping  the  students  in  learning  and 
improving the overall learning experience. 

In addition to the data available from  student activities, data 
are  also  created  by  educational 
institutions  which  use 
applications  to  manage  courses,  classes  and  students.  The 
amount  of  data  made  available  in  the  above  scenarios  is  so 
enormous  [1]  that  traditional  processing  techniques  cannot  be 
used to process them. Due to the limitations of the conventional 
data  processing  applications,  the  educational  institutions  have 
started  exploring  “Big  Data”  technologies  to  process  the 
educational data. 

3.  BIG DATA 

The  term  “Big  Data”  refers  to  any  set  of  data  [3]  that  is  so 
large  or  so  complex  that  conventional  applications  are  not 
adequate  to  process  them.  The  term  also  refers  to  the  tools  and 
technologies  used  to  handle  “Big  Data”.  Examples  of  Big  Data 
include  the  amount  of  data  shared  in  the  internet  everyday, 
YouTube  videos  viewed,  twitter  feeds  and  mobile  phone 
location  data.  In  the  recent  years,  data  produced  by  learning 
environments  have  also  started  to  get  big  enough  raising  the 
need for Big Data technologies and tools to handle them. 

3.1  CHALLENGES IN HANDLING BIG DATA 

Several challenges  need to be addressed  while  handling Big 

Data. Those challenges include  

3.1.1  Storage: 

While the common capacity of hard disks nowadays is in the 
range of terabytes, the amount of data generated through internet 
everyday is in the order of exabytes. Though the data generated 
in  education  is  not  as  large  as  all  the  data  generated  through 
internet, it is large enough, and would get much larger in future. 
The traditional RDBMS tools will be unable to store or process 
such Big Data. To overcome this challenge, databases that don't 
use  traditional  SQL  based  queries  are  used.  Compression 
technology is used to compress the data at rest and in memory. 

3.1.2  Analysis: 

As  data  generated  to  several  types  of  online  learning  sites 
differ in structure and the size of the data is also huge, analysis 

1035 

KATRINA SIN AND LOGANATHAN MUTHU: APPLICATION OF BIG DATA IN EDUCATION DATA MINING AND LEARNING ANALYTICS – A LITERATURE REVIEW 

of  the  data  may  consume  a  lot  of  time  and  resources.  To 
overcome  this,  scaled  out  architectures  are  used  to  process  the 
data  in  a  distributed  manner.  Data  are  split  into  smaller  pieces 
and  processed  in  a  vast  number  of  computers  available 
throughout the network and the processed data is aggregated. 

and  Compression  technology  to  overcome  the  challenges 
faced in handling Big Data. 

4.  APPLICATIONS IN LEARNING 

3.1.3  Reporting: 

Big  Data  techniques  can  be  used  in  a  variety  of  ways  in 

Traditional  reports  involve  display  of  statistical  data  in  the 
form  of  numbers.  When  large  amount  of  data  are  involved, 
traditional reports become difficult to interpret by human beings. 
In  those  cases  the  reports  need  to  be represented  in  a  form  that 
can be easily recognized by looking into them. 

The Big Data technologies overcome these  challenges using 

various techniques.  

3.2  TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

3.2.1  Techniques: 

The challenges faced in processing Big Data technologies are 
overcome  by  using  various  techniques.  The  most  popular 
techniques used in educational data mining are listed below. 

 Regression  –  Regression  is  used  in  predicting  values  of  a 
dependant  variable  by  estimating  the  relationship  among 
variables using statistical analysis 

 Nearest  Neighbor  –  In  this  technique  the  values  are 
predicted based on the predicted values of the records that 
are nearest to the record tha needs to be predicted. 

 Clustering  –  Clustering  involves  grouping  of  records  that 
are similar by identifying the distance between them in an 
n-dimensional space where n is the number of variables.  

 Classification  –  Classification  is  the  identification  of  the 
category/class to which a value  belongs to, on the basis of 
previously categorized values. 

3.2.2  Open Source Tools: 

Several  Open  source  tools  exist  which  help  in  taming  Big 

Data [9] Some of the top tools are listed below. 

 MongoDB is a cross platform document oriented database 
management system. It uses JSON like douments instead of 
a table based architecture. 

 Hadoop  is  a  framework  that  allows  distributed  processing 
of  big  datasets  across  clusters  of  networked  computers 
using simple programming models. 

 MapReduce is a programming model and framework used 
by  hadoop.  It  enables  processing  huge  amount  of  data  in 
parallel on large clusters of compute nodes. 

 Orange  is  a  python  based  tool  for  processing  and  mining 
big  data.  It  has  an  easy  to  use  interface  with  drag  &  drop 
functionalities with variety of add-ons. 

 Weka  is  a  java  based  tool  for  processing  large  amount  of 
data. It has a  vast  selection of algorithms  that can be  used 
in mining data. 

3.2.3  Proprietary Tools: 

 SAP  HANA  is  a  proprietary  in-memory  RDBMS  capable 
of  handling 
large  amount  of  data.  It  uses  Parallel 
InMemory  relational  query  techniques,  Columnar  stores 

learning analytics as listed below [8]: 

 Performance Prediction  

o Student's  performance  can  be  predicted  by  analyzing 
student's  interaction  in  a  learning  environment  with 
other students and teachers 

 Attrition Risk Detection 

o By  analyzing  the  student's  behavior,  risk  of  students 
dropping  out  from  courses  can  be  detected  and 
measures  can  be  implemented  in  the  beginning  of  the 
course to retain students. 

 Data Visualization 

o Reports  on  educational  data  become  more  and  more 
complex  as  educational  data  grow  in  size.  Data  can  be 
visualized  using  data  visualization  techniques  to  easily 
identify  the  trends  and  relations  in  the  data  just  by 
looking on the visual reports. 

 Intelligent feedback 

o Learning systems can provide intelligent and immediate 
feedback  to  students  in  reponse  to  their  inputs  which 
will improve student interaction and performance.  

 Course Recommendation 

o New courses can be recommended to students based on 
the interests of the students identified by analyzing their 
activities.  That  will  ensure  that  students  are  not 
misguided  in  choosing  fields  in  which  they  may  not 
have interest.  

 Student skill estimation  

o Estimation of the skills acquired by the student 

 Behavior Detection 

o Detection  of  student  behaviors  in  community  based 
activities  or  games  which  help  in  developing  a  student 
model 

 Grouping & collaboration of students  
 Social network analysis  
 Developing concept maps  
 Constructing courseware  
 Planning and scheduling 

4.1  PERFORMANCE PREDICTION 

Predictive Analytics enables prediction of student's behavior, 
skill and performance by analyzing various activities performed 
by the student  while interacting  with the  Learning Management 
System  or  with  fellow  students.  Based  on  the  activities  of  the 
students, the performance of the students can be predicted using 
the  data  mining  techniques  that  can  be  used  in  identifying  the 
underperforming  students  so  that  the  instructors  can  focus  on 
developing them. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  [10]  in  his  case  study  titled  “Applying 
Big  Data  in  Higher  Education:  A  Case  Study”,  describes  the 
successful  implementation  of  a  Big  Data  analysis  tool:  “SAP's 
HANA”,  in  the  University  of  Kentucky.  By  monitoring  and 
analyzing the  student's background data, their system calculates

a  scored  termed  “K-Score”  for  each  student.  The  score  depicts 
the  involvement  of  students  in  the  learning  activities.  A  low 
score  represents  an  underperforming  student  who  needs  to  be 
taken care of. 

4.2  SKILL ESTIMATION 

Skill  Estimation  refers  to  the  estimation  of  the  skills  of  the 
students so that the learning environment can be adjusted to suit 
the  student's  skills.  Skills  were  calculated  based  on  the 
interaction  of  the  student  with  the  system  or  in  the  message 
boards or discussion forums. 

Paulo  Blikstein  in  his  paper  “Using  learning  analytics  to 
assess  students'  behavior  in  open-ended  programming  tasks” 
[11]  notes  the  use  of  a  tool  named  “NetLogo”.  He  logs  the 
mouse  inputs  of  students  into  the  lab  machines  through  the 
software  and  with  help  of  the  data  logged  finds  the  error  rates 
and progress rates of the students. 

Beheshti [12] , in his paper titled “Predictive performance of 
prevailing  approaches  to  skills  assessment  techniques:  Insights 
from  real  vs.  synthetic  data  sets”,  uses  synthetic  as  well  as  real 
data  sets  for  assessing  the  skills  of  learners.  He  compares  the 
differences  between  the  details  of  the  skills  obtained  by  the 
different  techniques  and  analyses  his  methodology.  The  results 
show that the real data provides more accurate results. 

4.3  BEHAVIOR DETECTION 

Joseph  Grafsgaard  [13],  in  his  paper  “Predicting  Learning 
and  Affect  from  Multimodal  Data  Streams  in  Task-Oriented 
Tutorial Dialogue”, presents a system  for recognizing the  facial 
expressions of the students to predict the engagement, frustration 
and learning outcomes of students after the learning session. He 
also  uses  gesture  detection  and  posture  tracking  algorithms  to 
capture  non-verbal  behaviors  of  students  and  associates  them 
with the learning patterns. 

Seong  Jae  Lee  [14],  in  his  paper  “Learning  Individual 
Behavior  in  an  Educational  Game:  A  Data-Driven  Approach”, 
describes  a  framework  for  modeling  user's  behavior.  The 
proposed  system  learns  individual  policies  from  the  movement 
of  the  players  in  the  game  and  builds  a  cognitive  model.  He 
states  that  this  type  of  modeling  will  help  in  understanding 
learning processes of the user who interacts with the system and 
in adapting the learning environment to the user. 

4.4  ATTRITION RISK PREDICTION 

Researchers  have  also  used  the  big  data  techniques  in 
predicting  the  risk  of  attrition  associated  with  students.  In 
educational institutions where the students are likely to drop out 
of courses, the student's activities are monitored and the student's 
engagement score is predicted. The predicted score was found to 
be dependent on the attrition rates. 

Lalitha Agnohotri, in her paper titled “Building a Student At-
Risk  Model:  An  End-to-End  Perspective  From  User  to  Data 
Scientist”, proposes a new model named “Student At Risk” that 
is  capable  of  calculating  risk  ratings  for  new  joinees.  She  uses 
historical  data  to  model  the  student's  behavior  and  uses  the 
created model in the system to calculate the attrition risks of new 
joinees.  The  ratings  can  be  used  to  identify  the  students  at  risk 
and take needed measures to retain those students in advance. 

4.5  DATA VISUALIZATION 

Paulo Blikstein also points to a tool named “SNAPP” (Social 
Networks  Adapting  Pedagogical  Practice)  that  is  used  by 
instructors to visualize the interaction of students in online blogs 
and find the course in which they are interested the most. 

Vince  Kellen  (2013)  uses  the  data  obtained  on  the  student 
activities  in  classrooms  and  builds  a  visualization  of  classroom 
utilization for each classroom on a weekly and hourly basis. The 
visualization  clearly  shows  the  patterns  of  the  data  that  can  be 
easily  recognized  compared  to  the  traditional  way  of  reporting 
the  data.  Also  the  data  are  not  aggregated  and  are  directly 
processed with the help of HANA to produce the visualization. 

5.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

the  annual 

Since  2011, 

International  Conference  on 
Educational  Data  Mining  (EDM)  and  the  annual  International 
Conference on  Learning  Analytics and Knowledge (LAK)  have 
seen  many  papers  submitted  and  presented  to  showcase  the 
emerging and  fast developing field of Educational Data Mining 
and Learning  Analytics (refer Fig.1.). The trend in the numbers 
of articles submitted/published in  the two journals in the past 5 
years clearly shows the growing interest in the field.

A  total  of  119  papers  have  been  submitted  in  the  recent 
international  conference  on  Educational  Data  Mining  held  in 
2014  which  shows  dramatic  increase  in  the  number  of  papers 
submitted when compared to the 103 and 51 papers submitted in 
the  same  conference  in  2013  and  2012  respectively.  The  graph 
shown below clearly shows the growth of research in this field.  

The  research  papers  submitted  in  EDM  2014  covered  a 
variety  of  topics  under  Education  Data  Mining  and  Big  Data. 
But around 54% of the submitted papers were addressing the top 
8 topics.

Fig.2. Popular Topics in EDM 2014 

13  out  of  the  119  papers  that  were  submitted  in  the  2014 
edition  of  the  EDM  conference  were  associated  with  Behavior 
Detection  techniques.  Most  of  these  papers  were  involved  in 
studying and detecting the behavior and engagement of students 
in  educational  games.  In  Game-Based  Learning  environments, 
the student's were allowed to play some game, while the system 
monitored the student's activities. Using the data available on the 
activities  of  the  student  while  playing  the  game,  the  system 
detects the behavior of the student and applies it to adapt to the 
student or for modeling the student behavior. 

in  Open  and  Distance  Learning 

There are also many articles  on learning analytics published 
in various journal such as Journal of Learning Analytics, Journal 
of  Educational  Technology  &  Society,  International  Review  of 
Research 
(IRRODL), 
International  Journal  of  Technology  Enhanced  Learning, 
International  Journal  of  E-Learning  and  Distance  Education 
(JDE),  Australasian  Journal  of  Educational  Technology, 
International  Journal  of  Learning  Technology  and  British 
Journal of Educational Technology 

However,  for  the  purpose  of  this  study,  we  only  review 
searched  literature  on  Google  Scholar  sorted  by  relevance 
relating to Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. 

5.2  METHODS 

5.2.1  Data Collection: 

This  study  reviews  literature  chosen  with  the  primary  focus 
in  Educational  Data  Mining  and  Learning  Analytics  and  its 
implications  to  higher  education,  educational  technology  and 
instructional design.  

Google  Scholar  was  used  to  search  and  locate  academic 
papers  from  journals,  conference  proceedings  and  professional 
magazines  with  the  keywords  “educational  data  mining”  and 
“learning  analytics”.  The  search  period  was  set  from  2010  to 
2015  and  the  papers  reviewed  include  both  qualitative  and 
quantitative  studies  from  researchers  in  the  field  of  educational 

1038 

data mining and learning analytics worldwide. The search for the 
keywords  in  Google  Scholar  when  sorted  by  relevance  yielded 
the below results.

For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  the  data  collection  process 
resulted in the identification of a total of 90 distinct articles. 45 
articles  were  selected  for  the  search  term  “Educational  Data 
Mining”  [15-59]  and  another  45  articles  were  selected  for  the 
search term “Learning Analytics” [11; 60-103]. From the search 
results, it can be seen that all these articles have been frequently 
cited by other  researchers.  As these articles are frequently  cited 
by  researchers,  they  can  be  selected  as  a  good  representative 
sample of the literature in the field. 

5.2.2  Data Classification/Analysis 

Articles were classified both quantitatively and qualitatively. 
The  quantitative  analysis  was  used  to  classify  the  papers 
according  to  the  publication  year  and  the  type  of  publication  in 
which the articles appeared. Papers were qualitatively classified 
using  open  coded  content  analysis  whereby  each  paper  was 
reviewed to identify themes and trends in the literature. 

5.3  RESULTS 

5.3.1  Quantitative Details: 

From the 45 articles selected on “Educational Data Mining” , 
17 were published in 2010, 6 in 2011, 14 in 2012, 5 in 2013 and 
3  in  2014  (Fig.3.).  From  the  45  articles  selected  on  “Learning 
Analytics”,  2  were  published  in  2010,  8  articles  in  2011,  20 
articles in 2012, 14 articles in 2013, 1 article in 2014 and none in 
2015  (Fig.4.).  As  Google  Scholar  searched  on  relevance  of  the 
article  based  on  frequency  of  views  and  citation,  articles  from 
2014  and  2015  were  not  listed  at  the  top  results  of  the  search, 
therefore not reviewed in this study.

5.4  LIMITATIONS 

Due to time constraint, only 90 articles were reviewed, which 
represents  only  1%  of  the  search  results  for  the  terms 
“Educational Data Mining” and “Learning Analytics” in Google 
Scholar.  Also  due  to  Google  Scholar  search  algorithm,  articles 
from year 2014 and 2015 were not listed at the top of the search 
results, thus not selected for the review in this study. 

Another  limitation  is  that  articles  published  in  languages 
other  than  English  were  not  considered  for  this  review.  As  the 
search  was  conducted  only  on  Google  Scholar,  articles  from 
journals and academic databases were also not included. 

5.5  DISCUSSION 

The growth in the emerging fields of educational data mining 
and  learning  analytics  can  be  seen  from  the  availability  of 
literature from 2010 until present. In the 45 articles selected for 
review  in  “Educational  Data  Mining”,  18  were  focusing  on 
exploring  the  ways  in  which  the  data  mining  techniques  can  be 
applied in education, while another 18 focused on evaluating or 
predicting  student's  performance.  A  few  articles  focused  on 
specific  data  mining  algorithms  and  pedagogical  analysis.  This 
clearly  shows  that  researchers  are  focusing  mainly  on  the  top 
two  themes,  the  application  of  data  mining  techniques  in 
education  and  prediction  of  student  performance.  The  4  themes 
were  selected  as  they  clearly  distinguish  the  articles  into  4 
groups and help identify the theme most used by the researchers. 

Even  though  only  45  articles  on  “Learning  Analytics”  were 
reviewed in this study, it can be seen from the theme categories 
that  researchers  are  focusing  their  efforts  on  3  major  trends  in 
the field of learning analytics. 

First,  there  are  articles  focusing  on  the  development  of 
academic  analytics,  and  introduction  of  learning  analytics,  its 
concepts,  implications  and  impact  to  higher  education  and  e-
learning,  the  importance  of  aligning  with  pedagogy,  learning 
theory  and  design  and  the  research  frameworks  and  ethics 
policies.  

Second,  from  the  technical  view  point,  researchers  are 
looking  at  educational  data  mining  and  the  use  of  datasets  to 
improve  learning  analytics,  especially  through  communication 
and collaboration between educational data mining and learning 
analytics  communities.  To  help  teachers  and  students  visualise 
learning  traces,  researchers  are  designing  and  developing 
frameworks  and  dashboards  for  information  visualization.  The 
use of learning analytics in assessments enabling automated, real 
time  feedback  using  multiple  modalities  and  videogames  to 
students, will impact student performance and success.  

Third,  the  use  of  learning  analytics  in  social  learning  and 
MOOCs. Learners build knowledge together in their cultural and 
forums,

The  study  also  revealed  less  number  of  articles  focusing  on 
evaluating learning outcomes by analyzing natural language text.  
Researchers  can  focus  on  predicting  student  performance  in 
learning  environments  where  students  interact  through  forums.

evaluated by teachers, it has greater scope for the application of 
big data techniques in the future.  

6.  CONCLUSION 

As  the  data  involved  in  education  becomes  larger,  the 
applications  of  Big  Data  techniques  become  more  and  more 
necessary in learning environments. MOOCs are good examples 
of  learning  environments  that  were  resource  hungry  and  raised 
the  need  for  data  mining  in  education.  The  recent  trends  in  the 
published papers in EDM indicate the growth in data mining in 
education  field.  Apart  from  EDM  which  we  saw  in  this  study, 
other  communities  are  also  involved  in  researching  this  field. 
Exploring those communities will provide greater insights in the 
field.  Educational  Data  Mining  is  sure  to  reshape  the  way  in 
which the forthcoming generations would learn. 

This  study  revealed  two  major  trends  from  articles  located 
from  top  45  search  results  of  a  Google  scholar  search  on 
“Educational  Data  Mining”.  The  articles  were  mainly  from 
journals  and  conferences  related  to  Educational  Data  Mining. 
The major trends were identified as “Introduction to the concepts 
of  applying  Data  Mining  in  Education”  and  “Prediction  or 
measurement  of  Student  Performance  using  Data  Mining”.  As 
the  former 
involved  articles  on  performance 
prediction,  we  can  conclude  that  the  biggest  focus  is  on 
“Performance Prediction using Data Mining”. 

trend  also 

This  study  also  highlighted  3  major  trends  and  10  themes 
from articles located from the top 45 search results of a Google 
Scholar  search  on  “Learning  Analytics”.  The  articles  were 
mainly  from  Educational  Technology  journals  and  conference 
proceedings. There were 22 articles on the first trend of articles 
introducing the concept and development of the field of learning 
analytics  to  higher  education  and  e-learning,  17  articles  on  the 
second  trend  of  technical  development  of  learning  analytics 
framework and tools, and 6 articles on the third trend of learning 
analytics use in social learning.  

As  this  study  has  reviewed  only  a  tiny  portion  of  the 
available articles, there remains a need for a systematic study of 
published  literature  on  the  fast  growing  field  of  application  of 
big data in education and learning.
