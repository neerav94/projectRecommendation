Abstract.  Currently,  the  usage  rate  of  GPS  is  increasing.  In  addition  to  GPS, 
Big Data is also in the spotlight. The Big Data is a technique that creates values 
through repetition pattern analysis of data [1]. Using the Big Data, it is possible 
to  analyze  the  movement  path,  time,  and  behavior  pattern  repetitive  of  the 
students.  This  study  has  been  conducted  using  the  information  collected 
through  GPS.  Our  future  work  will  be  on  increasing  the  reliability  of  the  data 
and gathering of information of the day of the week,  weather, blood type,  and 
occupation.

1     Introduction 

Currently,  the  usage  rate  of  the  GPS  receiver  is  increasing  [2][6].  GPS  is  used  in 
many  fields  such  as  intersection  location,  aircrafts,  vehicles,  and  smartphones  [9]. 
Among these, GPS is widely used in smartphones in particular when compared with 
the other fields.

In this paper, we use the Big Data analysis using the GPS data. Currently, the Big 
Data is used in many parts of the world, similar to the real-time automatic translation 
system  by  Google  [3].  The  Big  Data  is  used  in  ZARA  availability  management, 
operating  systems,  and  Transportation  Safety  Authority’s  service  record  analysis 
system  [8].  The  Big  Data  is  the  core  technology  used  in  many  fields  such  as 
prevention  of  disease,  crime,  unemployment,  accident  prevention,  earthquake 
prediction, and stock price analysis [4][7]. The GPS aids in collecting a large amount

3     Conclusion 

In this study, the students’ movement pattern data from  the combined patterns of the 
moving  path  and  behavior  were  calculated.  This  study  was  conducted  using  the 
collected GPS data, such as time, grade, and sex, via smartphone.   

From  the  results  of  the  high-level  analysis  and  Big  Data,  we  could  determine  the 
specific  and  detailed  student  movement  patterns.  This  study  analyzed  the  results  of 
the students’ movement patterns, based on which, we will conduct further research on 
the  movement  pattern  with  additional  data  such  as  weather,  season,  blood,  and 
occupation.
