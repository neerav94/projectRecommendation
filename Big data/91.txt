Introduction

Big Data

Spurred by the growth of the World Wide Web and the Internet, 
and  their  similarity  to  numerous  other  large,  dynamic,  real-life 
networks, a truly cross-disciplinary science of complex networks has 
emerged in the past 15 years [1-12]. Hundreds of studies have been 
conducted  and  papers  published  exploring  properties  of  complex 
networks—such as, their size, diameter, degree distribution, pairwise-
distance distribution, cliques, communities, clustering coefficient, and 
the like [5-11]. Several growth models of these evolving networks have 
been proposed and studied [5,6]. However, an area of active interest, 
which  has  not  been  studied  adequately,  is  that  of  designing  control 
policies to steer the evolution of such a network towards a desired goal 
[8]. In practical situations, such as controlling the spread of diseases or 
the formation of opinions, topological properties, of the network, may 
need to be controlled. It would, therefore, be valuable to have automated 
synthesis [7] of strategies for controlling relevant topological properties 
of  complex  networks  described  by,  for  example,  a  preferential-
attachment and preferential-deletion model [6]. We propose that an 
automated optimal control of evolving complex networks be achieved 
by  leveraging  recent  results  in  developing  stochastic  models  for  the 
evolution  of  complex  networks  in  combination  with  the  classical 
results on dynamic-programming algorithms for optimal control [2-4].
Complex Networks

Interactions  between  multiple  entities  have  been  modeled  and 
studied as static graphs at small scale for nearly a century. But the study 
of large, random, evolving graphs as models for the World Wide Web, 
the Internet, and other real-life networks took off only about 15 years 
ago.  In  particular,  inspired  by  the  need  to  understand  the  evolving 
interactions among multiple entities in sub-disciplines as different as 
cyber-security and metagenomics, the study of complex networks has 
generated a great deal of interest in the computer-science community.
The  Erdos-Renyi  uniform  random  graphs  exhibit  neither  the 
degree  distribution  nor  the  clustering  coefficient  of  many  naturally 
occurring real-world networks. The degree distribution of small-world 
networks  is  binomial  and,  hence,  disagrees  with  that  of  many  real-
world networks. Likewise, static models are not capable of providing a 
description of the temporal evolution of real-world networks; thus, the 
recent emphasis on studying dynamic models of real-world networks. 
Such models are usually described by a stochastic graph process, where 
the graph evolves by two broad sets of rules: (i) Preferential attachment 
of  a  new  node  to  existing  nodes,  and  (ii)  Copying.  Most  of  these 
stochastic models have focused on the shape of the asymptotic degree 
distribution of complex real-world networks. 

Much of the recent study of real-world networks identifies broad 
families of complex networks, models their generative processes, and 
suggests algorithms that exploit the properties of these broad families 
of  real-world  networks.  The  focus  of  investigation  into  real-world 
networks has been on a set of easily measurable properties of graphs: 
e. g, size, diameter, degree distribution, pair-wise-distance distribution, 
cliques,  communities,  clustering  coefficient,  connectivity  and  the 
like. Several families of networks, including citation networks, email 
networks,  twitter  networks,  social  networks,  peer-to-peer  networks, 
metabolic networks, genetic regulatory networks, and web graphs, have 
been well studied using these readily measurable properties of graphs. 

While the interdisciplinary area of complex networks has enabled us 
to understand, analyze, and predict the evolving complex interactions 
among the network entities; with the advent of rapid data acquisition 
techniques in combination with the dramatic drop in cost of sensing, 
transmitting, storing, and processing data, we are surrounded by Big 
Data. It has now become possible to track the evolution of interactions 
among network entities in real-time. 

While  different  models  have  been  proposed  to  account  for  the 
variety  of  complex  networks  observed  in  natural  and  engineered 
systems;  computational  methods  for  automated  synthesis  of  control 
strategies  to  steer  such  evolving  interactions  towards  a  desired  goal 
have not received adequate attention. Problems requiring synthesis of 
such optimal control strategies for complex networks are all around us 
[8]. Two representative examples are discussed in the following:
Epidemics on Networks

The spread of infectious diseases is often modeled with dynamic 
contact networks--where nodes represent infected individuals [9]. As 
the disease spreads, new nodes are added to this network. The death of a 
patient results in deletion of the corresponding node from the dynamic 
network of infected individuals. In such a setting, the probability of a 
node being added to the network can be controlled through a number 
of tools: isolation, immunization, and quarantine. While it is desirable 
to enforce all mechanisms to prevent an epidemic, we seek to optimize 
the  trade-off  between  the  control  of  the  epidemic  and  the  total  cost 
of  the  control  methods  employed  to  achieve  such  a  goal.  Using  the 
optimal control synthesis approach envisioned here, we can synthesize 
optimal strategies for controlling the number of infected individuals in 
evolving epidemiological networks. 
Opinion Networks

The second example of controller synthesis for complex networks 
is the formation of robust opinion networks. The creation of a stable 
opinion  network  may  require  the  formation  of  a  dense  network 
such that the entire opinion network itself is robust and immune to 
deletion of a few nodes. Thus, the topological property of interest for 
such networks is the average edge-density of such an opinion network. 
While the probability of adding a new node can be directly controlled, 
a key question is how to determine the optimal birth process to ensure 
that the edge-density of the network reaches a desired threshold.

Control Strategy

Here,  we  propose  that  dynamic  programming  based  optimal 
control synthesis for stochastic dynamical systems be used to synthesize 
control strategies for stochastic models of evolving complex networks. 
This approach combines the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) dynamic 
programming algorithm with a stochastic model for the evolution of 
complex networks involving the preferential birth and death of nodes 
in the complex network.
Automated Synthesis of Control Strategy

Recent  advances  in  constraint  solving  technology  have  led  to 
renewed interest in the problem of automated synthesis [7]. Synthesis 
algorithms  for  systems  as  varied  as  software,  stochastic  models  in 
biology  and  hybrid  and  dynamical  systems  have  been  developed. 
However, the automated synthesis of control strategies for stochastic 
complex  networks  has  not  been  studied  much.  Our  approach  for 
controlling  the  dynamics  of  stochastic  complex  networks  builds 
on  existing  work  in  complex  networks  theory  and  in  the  optimal 
deterministic control of stochastic dynamical systems. It involves the 
following three different steps:

1.  Based on the interactions observed among the entities being 
studied,  we  first  choose  an  appropriate  stochastic  dynamical 
model  for  describing  the  evolution  of  these  interactions.  A 
variety of existing dynamical models have been proposed and 
are  available  in  the  literature.  Some  of  these  dynamic  real-
world network models include those that only permit birth of 
new nodes, while others allow both the birth of new nodes and 
the death of the old ones. Several readily measurable properties 
of  the  interactions  being  studied  (e.g.,  degree  distributions, 
graph diameter, number and size of communities, etc.) may be 
used to determine a stochastic dynamic model appropriate for 
describing the temporally evolving interactions.

the 

topological  characteristics  of 

2.  When  a  suitable  stochastic  dynamical  model  has  been 
identified  using 
the 
interactions  being  studied,  we  still  need  to  determine  the 
numerical  values  parameters  that  can  fit  the  behavioral 
predictions of the stochastic dynamical model to the empirical 
data corresponding to the observed interactions. For example, 
a  stochastic  preferential  attachment  and  deletion  model 
for  complex  networks  is  parameterized  by  the  probability 
that  determines  the  rates  of  birth  and  death  of  nodes  in  the 
network.  The  probability  must  be  chosen  carefully  so  that 
the predictions of the model are in close agreement with the 
observed values. A variety of machine learning techniques may 
be used to compute the numerical parameters of the model. 
If  the  observations  are  available  as  time-series  data;  Kalman 
filtering, Bayesian networks, or evolutionary algorithms may 
be used to determine the parameters of the stochastic model. If 
there are additional qualitative constraints on the interactions 
being studied, parameter synthesis methods based on temporal 
logic  and  symbolic  algorithms  may  be  used  to  prune  the 
parameter search space. At the end of this step, a completely 
defined stochastic dynamical model describing the evolution 
of the complex network is determined.

3.  We  then  suggest  the  synthesis  of  control  strategies  using 
dynamic programming based optimal control algorithms for 
the stochastic dynamical model so as to achieve one or more

desired topological properties of complex networks. In order 
to  compute  an  optimal  strategy,  we  must  first  define  a  cost 
function that approximates the desired notion of optimality. 
We recommend using a cost metric involving the state of the 
complex  network  and  the  control  inputs  applied  to  it,  that 
captures  two  different  aspects  of  an  optimal  control  strategy 
for  complex  networks:  (i)  the  distance  between  the  current 
topological property of an evolving network and the desired 
state  of  the  topological  property,  and  (ii)  the  cost  associated 
with the input being applied to steer the complex network to 
a desired state. This will drive a complex network to a desired 
topology  and  minimize  the  cost  involved  with  the  control 
inputs that guide the complex network. 

Conclusion

In this paper, we have outlined how Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman style 
synthesis of control strategies can be applied to the problem of optimal 
control in complex networks. We have focused on a continuous variant 
of the preferential attachment and deletion model. In future work, one 
should investigate the capability of the proposed framework to design 
control  strategies  for  other  stochastic  dynamic  models  of  evolving 
complex  networks.  Further,  as  the  control  law  is  being  applied, 
additional  observations  on  the  evolving  complex  network  may  be 
used to ascertain the efficacy of the control policy. Our ongoing work 
includes investigating the use of online algorithms for controlling the 
evolution of complex networks.

As  we  encounter  the  flood  of  Big  Data,  much  of  it  being 
unstructured at least on the surface, it is imperative that we seek out 
hidden structures to manage, understand, and exploit Big Data. Graph 
theory  and  complex  network  may  prove  to  be  a  very  convenient 
framework  for  such  an  undertaking.  The  optimal  control  synthesis 
philosophy discussed here may then be deployed to control engineered 
and natural systems whose evolution can be described by structured 
Big Data.
