(1)  Ontology  free.  The  ontology  based  labeling  de-
fines  ontology  and  then  let  users  label  the  multimedia 
resources  using  the  semantic  markups  in  the  ontology. 
Social tagging requires all the users in the social network 
label the  multimedia resources with their  own keywords 
and share with others. Different from ontology based an-
notation.  There  is  no  pre-defined  ontology  or  taxonomy 
in  social  tagging.  Thus  the  tagging  task  is  more  conven-
ient for users.  

(2)  User  oriented.  The  users  can  annotate  images 
with their favorite tags. The tags of multimedia resources 
are  determined  by  users‘  cognitive  ability.  To  the  multi-
media resources, users may give different tags. Each mul-
timedia  resource  may  be  with  one  tag  at  least,  and  each 
tag may appear in many different multimedia resources. 

(3) 

Semantic  loss.  Irrelevant  social  tags  frequently 
appear,  and  users  typically  will  not  tag  all  semantic  ob-
jects in the image, which is called semantic loss. Polysemy, 
synonyms,  and  ambiguity  are  some  drawbacks  of  social 
tagging. 

In this paper, the Semantic Link Network (SLN) [18, 19, 
20]  model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources 
with  social  tags.  Semantic  Link  Network  is  designed  to 
establish  associated  relations  among  various  resources 
(e.g.,  Web  pages  or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming 
at extending the loosely connected network of no seman-
tics  (e.g.,  the  Web)  to  an  association-rich  network.  Since 
the theory of cognitive science considers that the associat-
ed  relations  can  make  one  resource  more  comprehensive 
to users [21], the motivation of SLN is to organize the as-
sociated  resources  loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  ef-
fectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as 
browsing,  knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness 
between  tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in 
the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  The  major  contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized as follow.  

(1) A  whole  model  for  generating  the  association  rela-
tion  between  multimedia  resources  using  Semantic  Link 
Network  model  is  proposed.  The  definitions,  modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used 
in the proposed method. The integration between the Se-
mantic Link Network and multimedia resources provides 
a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. 
(2) The  tags  and  the  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia 
resources are used to measure their semantic association.  
The  hierarchical  semantic  of  multimedia  resources  are 
defined  by  their  annotated  tags  and  surrounding  texts. 
The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different 
in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic 
Link Network model are implemented to measure associ-
ation relations. 

(3) A real data set including 100 thousand images with 
social  tags  from  Flickr  is  used  in  our  experiments.  Two 
evaluation methods including clustering and retrieval are 
performed, which shows the proposed method can meas-
ure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accu-
rately and robustly. 

(4) The  relatedness  measures  between  concepts  are  ex-

tended  to  the  level  of  multimedia.  Since  the  association 
relation  is  the  basic  mechanism  of  brain.  The  proposed 
Semantic Link Network based model can help the multi-
media  related  applications  such  as  searching  and  recom-
mendation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
gives  the  related  work  of  social  tags  and  semantic  link 
network. The problem definition is introduced in Section 
3.  Section  4  proposes  the  method  for  measuring  associa-
tion of multimedia. Experiments are presented in Section 
5. Conclusions are made in the last section. 

2  RELATED WORK 

Advances  in  Semantic  Web  have  made  ontology  another 
useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  semantics.  The 
ontology  builds  a  formal  and  explicit  representation  of 
semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  relation-
ships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive im-
plicit  knowledge.  In  this  section,  the  related  work  of  the 
proposed  model  is  given.  The  Semantic  Web  [15]  is  an 
evolving development of the World Wide Web, in which 
the meanings of information on the web is defined; there-
fore,  it  is  possible  for  machines  to  process  it.  The  basic 
idea  of  Semantic  Web  is  to  use  ontological  concepts  and 
vocabularies to accurately describe contents in a machine 
readable  way.  These  concepts  and  vocabularies  can  then 
be shared and retrieved on the web. In the Semantic Web, 
each fragment of the description is a triple, based on De-
scription  Logic.  Thus,  the  implicit  connections  and  se-
mantics within the description fragments can be reasoned 
using  Description  Logic  theory  and  ontological  defini-
tions. Earlier research work on the Semantic Web focused 
on  defining  domain  specific  ontologies  and  reasoning 
technologies.  Therefore,  data  are  only  meaningful  in  cer-
tain  domains  and  are  not  connected  to  each  other  from 
the World Wide Web point of view, which certainly limits 
the  contributions  of  Semantic  Web  for  sharing  and  re-
trieving contents within a distributed environment. 

The  Semantic  Link  Network  (SLN)  was  proposed  as  a 
semantic  data  model  for  organizing  various  Web  re-
sources  by  extending  the  Web‘s  hyperlink  to  a  semantic 
link.  SLN  is  a  directed  network  consisting  of  semantic 
nodes and semantic links. A semantic node can be a con-
cept, an instance of concept, a schema of data set, a URL, 
any  form  of  resources,  or  even  an  SLN.  A  semantic  link 
reflects  a  kind  of  relational  knowledge  represented  as  a 
pointer  with  a  tag  describing  such  semantic  relations  as 
cause  Effect,  implication,  subtype,  similar,  instance,  se-
quence,  reference,  and  equal.  The  semantics  of  tags  are 
usually common sense and can be regulated by its catego-
ry,  relevant  reasoning  rules,  and  use  cases.  A  set  of  gen-
eral  semantic  relation  reasoning  rules  was  suggested  in 
[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-
verse  relations  are  knowledge  for  supporting  semantic 
relation reasoning. SLN is a self-organized network since 
any node can link to any other node via a semantic link.

Semantic  loss.  Irrelevant  social  tags  frequently 
appear,  and  users  typically  will  not  tag  all  semantic  ob-
jects in the image, which is called semantic loss. Polysemy, 
synonyms,  and  ambiguity  are  some  drawbacks  of  social 
tagging. 

In this paper, the Semantic Link Network (SLN) [18, 19, 
20]  model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources 
with  social  tags.  Semantic  Link  Network  is  designed  to 
establish  associated  relations  among  various  resources 
(e.g.,  Web  pages  or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming 
at extending the loosely connected network of no seman-
tics  (e.g.,  the  Web)  to  an  association-rich  network.  Since 
the theory of cognitive science considers that the associat-
ed  relations  can  make  one  resource  more  comprehensive 
to users [21], the motivation of SLN is to organize the as-
sociated  resources  loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  ef-
fectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as 
browsing,  knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness 
between  tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in 
the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  The  major  contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized as follow.  

(1) A  whole  model  for  generating  the  association  rela-
tion  between  multimedia  resources  using  Semantic  Link 
Network  model  is  proposed.  The  definitions,  modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used 
in the proposed method. The integration between the Se-
mantic Link Network and multimedia resources provides 
a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. 
(2) The  tags  and  the  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia 
resources are used to measure their semantic association.  
The  hierarchical  semantic  of  multimedia  resources  are 
defined  by  their  annotated  tags  and  surrounding  texts. 
The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different 
in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic 
Link Network model are implemented to measure associ-
ation relations.

social  tags  from  Flickr  is  used  in  our  experiments.  Two 
evaluation methods including clustering and retrieval are 
performed, which shows the proposed method can meas-

rately and robustly.

media  related  applications  such  as  searching  and  recom-
mendation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
gives  the  related  work  of  social  tags  and  semantic  link 
network. The problem definition is introduced in Section

2  RELATED WORK 

Advances  in  Semantic  Web  have  made  ontology  another 
useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  semantics.  The 
ontology  builds  a  formal  and  explicit  representation  of 
semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  relation-
ships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive im-
plicit  knowledge.  In  this  section,  the  related  work  of  the 
proposed  model  is  given.  The  Semantic  Web  [15]  is  an 
evolving development of the World Wide Web, in which 
the meanings of information on the web is defined; there-
fore,  it  is  possible  for  machines  to  process  it.  The  basic 
idea  of  Semantic  Web  is  to  use  ontological  concepts  and 
vocabularies to accurately describe contents in a machine 
readable  way.  These  concepts  and  vocabularies  can  then 
be shared and retrieved on the web. In the Semantic Web, 
each fragment of the description is a triple, based on De-
scription  Logic.  Thus,  the  implicit  connections  and  se-
mantics within the description fragments can be reasoned 
using  Description  Logic  theory  and  ontological  defini-
tions. Earlier research work on the Semantic Web focused 
on  defining  domain  specific  ontologies  and  reasoning 
technologies.  Therefore,  data  are  only  meaningful  in  cer-
tain  domains  and  are  not  connected  to  each  other  from 
the World Wide Web point of view, which certainly limits 
the  contributions  of  Semantic  Web  for  sharing  and  re-
trieving contents within a distributed environment. 

The  Semantic  Link  Network  (SLN)  was  proposed  as  a 
semantic  data  model  for  organizing  various  Web  re-
sources  by  extending  the  Web‘s  hyperlink  to  a  semantic 
link.  SLN  is  a  directed  network  consisting  of  semantic 
nodes and semantic links. A semantic node can be a con-
cept, an instance of concept, a schema of data set, a URL, 
any  form  of  resources,  or  even  an  SLN.  A  semantic  link 
reflects  a  kind  of  relational  knowledge  represented  as  a 
pointer  with  a  tag  describing  such  semantic  relations  as 
cause  Effect,  implication,  subtype,  similar,  instance,  se-
quence,  reference,  and  equal.  The  semantics  of  tags  are 
usually common sense and can be regulated by its catego-
ry,  relevant  reasoning  rules,  and  use  cases.  A  set  of  gen-
eral  semantic  relation  reasoning  rules  was  suggested  in 
[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-
verse  relations  are  knowledge  for  supporting  semantic 
relation reasoning. SLN is a self-organized network since 
any node can link to any other node via a semantic link.

3.2 The Basic Definitions 

SLN  has  been  used  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  query 
routing  in  P2P  network  [24],  and  it  has  been  adopted  as 
one of the major mechanisms of organizing resources for 
the  Knowledge  Grid.  Pons  has  successfully  applied  the 
SLN  to  object  prefetching  and  achieved  a  better  result 
than other approaches [25]. 

3  THE SEMANTIC LINK NETWORK BASED MODEL  

The  tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources 
are  used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  related-
ness between tags and  surrounding texts are implement-
ed  in  the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  In  this  section, 
the  details  of  the  proposed  model  are  given.  The  basic 
definitions, representations, heuristics are introduced. 

3.1  The Basic Mechanisms of the Proposed Model 
SLN can be formalized into a loosely coupled semantic 
model for managing various resources. As a data model, 
the  proposed  model  consists  of  the  following  parts,  as 
shown in Fig. 1. 

1)  Resources  representation  mechanism.  Element 
Fuzzy  Cognitive  Map  (E-FCM)  [19]  is  used  to  represent 
multimedia  resources  with  social  tags  since  it  does  not 
only  reserve  resources‘  keywords  but  also  the  relations 
among them. 

2)  Resources  storage  mechanism.  Database/XML  is 
used to store E-FCM since it is easy to define the mark-up 
elements. 

3)  SLN  generation  mechanism.  Based  on  E-FCM  and 
the  association  rules,  ALN  can  be  generated  by  machine 
automatically.  

4)  Application  mechanism.  SLN  can  be  used  for  Web 
intelligence  activities,  Web  knowledge  discovery  and 
publishing,  etc.  For  example,  when  a  user  browses  mul-
timedia,  other  resources  with  semantic  links  to  it  can  be 
recommended to the user. 

The  three  important  definitions  are  defined  firstly  in 
this  paper  including  the  social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia 
resource and the semantic relatedness between two  mul-
timedia resources. 

Definition  1:  Social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia  resource. 
The  social  tags  (denoted  by  t)  set  of  a  multimedia  re-
source f (denoted by s(f)) is a set of tags provided by users. 

                    (1) 

Definition  2:  Semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The 
) 

semantic  relatedness  between  tags  (denoted  by 

is the expected correlation of a pair of tags 

 and 

. 

Definition  3:  Semantic  relatedness  between  two  mul-
timedia  resources.  The  semantic  relatedness  between 
multimedia  resources  (denoted  by
)  is  the  ex-

pected  correlation  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources 

and 

. 

The range of 

 is from 0 to 1. A high value indi-

cates that semantic relatedness between tags is more like-
ly to be confidential.  

3.3  The Basic Heuristics 

Based  on  common  sense  and  our  observations  on  real 
data, five heuristics that serve as the base of the proposed 
computation model are given as follow. 

Heuristic 1. Usually each tag of a multimedia resource 

appears only one time. 

Different  from  writing  sentences,  users  usually  anno-
tate a multimedia resource with different tags. For exam-
ple,  the  possibility  of  using  tags  ―apple  apple  apple‖  for 
an image is very low. Therefore, in this paper, we do not 
employ any weighting scheme for tags such as tf-idf [26]. 
Heuristic 2. The order of the tags may reflect the corre-

lation against the annotated multimedia resource. 

Different tag reflects the different aspect of a multime-
dia resource. According to Heuristic 1, the weight of a tag 
against  the  image  cannot  be  obtained.  Fortunately,  the 
order  of  the  tags  can  be  get  since  user  may  provide  tags

Abstract—Recent research shows that multimedia resources “in the wild” are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In 
this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network model  is  used for  organizing multimedia  resources.  A  whole  model for  generating  the 
association relation between multimedia resources using Semantic Link Network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the Semantic Link 
Network  and  multimedia  resources  provides  a  new  prospect  for  organizing  them  with  their  semantics.  The  tags  and  the 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to  measure  their  semantic  association.  The  hierarchical  semantic  of 
multimedia resources are defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts 
are  different  in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic  Link  Network  model  are  implemented  to  measure 
association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two 
evaluation  methods  including  clustering  and  retrieval  are  performed,  which  shows  the  proposed  method  can  measure  the 
semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.

1  INTRODUCTION

R 

ECENTLY, Big data is an emerging paradigm applied 
to  datasets  whose  size  is  beyond  the  ability  of  com-
monly  used  software  tools  to  capture,  manage,  and  pro-
cess the data within a tolerable elapsed time [10]. Various 
technologies are being discussed to support the handling 
of  big  data  such  as  massively  parallel  processing  data-
bases [11], scalable storage systems [12, 33], cloud compu-
ting platforms [13, 34], and MapReduce [14, 35].   

Understanding  the  semantics  of  multimedia  has  been 
an  important  component  in  many  multimedia  based  ap-
plications. Manual annotation and tagging has been con-
sidered as a reliable source of multimedia semantics. Un-
fortunately,  manual  annotation  is  time-consuming  and 
expensive  when  dealing  with  huge  scale  of  multimedia 
data. Advances in Semantic Web [15] have made ontology 
another  useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  seman-
tics. Ontology builds a formal and explicit representation 
of  semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  rela-
tionships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive 
implicit  knowledge.  However,  the  semantic  gap  [16]  be-
tween  semantics  and  video  visual  appearance  is  still  a 
challenge  towards  automated  ontology-driven  video  an-
notation. With the rapid growth of video resources on the 
world-wide-web,  for  example,  on  YouTube 1  alone,  35 
hours  of  video  are  unloaded  every  minute  [2],  and  over 
700 billion videos were watched in 2010.  Vast amount of 
videos  with  no  metadata  have  emerged.  Thus  automati-
cally understanding raw multimedia solely based on their

visual  appearance  becomes  an  important  yet  challenging 
problem. Multimedia resources ―in the wild‖ are growing 
at  a  staggering  rate  [1,  2].  The  rapid  increase  number  of 
multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent  need  to  de-
velop intelligent methods to represent and annotate them. 
Typical  applications  in  which  representing  and  annotat-
ing  video  events  include  criminal  investigation  systems 
[3],  video  surveillance  [4],  intrusion  detection  system  [5], 
video  resources  browsing  and  indexing  system  [6],  sport 
events  detection  [7],  internet  of  things  [8,  9],  and  many 
others.  These  urgent  needs  have  posed  challenges  for 
multimedia  resources  management,  and  have  attracted 
the  research  of  the  multimedia  analysis  and  understand-
ing. Overall, the goal is to enable users to search the relat-
ed  resources  from  the  huge  number  of  multimedia  re-
sources.  

With  the  explosion  of  community  contributed  multi-
media content available online, many social media reposi-
tories (e.g. Flickr2, YouTube, and Zooomr3) allow users to 
upload media data and annotate content with descriptive 
keywords which are called social tags. Flickr provides an 
open  platform  for  users  to  publish  their  personal  images 
freely. The principal purpose of tagging is to make imag-
es  better  accessible  to  the  public.  The  success  of  Flickr 
proves that users are willing to participate in this seman-
tic context through manual annotations [17]. Flickr uses a 
promising  approach  for  manual  metadata  generation 
named  ―social  tagging‖,  which  requires  all  the  users  in 
the  social  network  label  the  multimedia  resources  with 
their own keywords and share with others. The character-
istics of social tags are as follows.

Social tagging requires all the users in the social network

[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-

Fuzzy  Cognitive  Map  (E-FCM)  [19]  is  used  to  represent 
multimedia  resources  with  social  tags  since  it  does  not 
only  reserve  resources‘  keywords  but  also  the  relations 
among them. 

2)  Resources  storage  mechanism.  Database/XML  is 
used to store E-FCM since it is easy to define the mark-up 
elements. 

3)  SLN  generation  mechanism.  Based  on  E-FCM  and 
the  association  rules,  ALN  can  be  generated  by  machine 
automatically.  

4)  Application  mechanism.  SLN  can  be  used  for  Web 
intelligence  activities,  Web  knowledge  discovery  and 
publishing,  etc.  For  example,  when  a  user  browses  mul-
timedia,  other  resources  with  semantic  links  to  it  can  be 
recommended to the user. 

The  three  important  definitions  are  defined  firstly  in 
this  paper  including  the  social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia 
resource and the semantic relatedness between two  mul-
timedia resources. 

Definition  1:  Social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia  resource. 
The  social  tags  (denoted  by  t)  set  of  a  multimedia  re-
source f (denoted by s(f)) is a set of tags provided by users. 

                    (1) 

Definition  2:  Semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The 
) 

semantic  relatedness  between  tags  (denoted  by 

is the expected correlation of a pair of tags 

 and 

. 

Definition  3:  Semantic  relatedness  between  two  mul-
timedia  resources.  The  semantic  relatedness  between 
multimedia  resources  (denoted  by
)  is  the  ex-

pected  correlation  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources 

and 

. 

The range of 

 is from 0 to 1. A high value indi-

cates that semantic relatedness between tags is more like-
ly to be confidential.  

3.3  The Basic Heuristics 

Based  on  common  sense  and  our  observations  on  real 
data, five heuristics that serve as the base of the proposed 
computation model are given as follow. 

Heuristic 1. Usually each tag of a multimedia resource 

appears only one time. 

Different  from  writing  sentences,  users  usually  anno-
tate a multimedia resource with different tags. For exam-
ple,  the  possibility  of  using  tags  ―apple  apple  apple‖  for 
an image is very low. Therefore, in this paper, we do not 
employ any weighting scheme for tags such as tf-idf [26]. 
Heuristic 2. The order of the tags may reflect the corre-

lation against the annotated multimedia resource. 

Different tag reflects the different aspect of a multime-
dia resource. According to Heuristic 1, the weight of a tag 
against  the  image  cannot  be  obtained.  Fortunately,  the 
order  of  the  tags  can  be  get  since  user  may  provide  tags

one by one.  

Heuristic  3.  The  number  of  tags  of  a  multimedia  re-

source may not relevant to the annotation correctness. 

Different users may give different tags about the same 
multimedia  resource.  For  example,  users  may  give  tags 
such as ―apple iPhone‖ or ―iPhone4 mobile phone‖ for  a 
same image about iPhone. It is hardly to say which tag is 
better  for  annotation  though  the  latter  annotation  has 
three tags. 

Heuristic  4.  Usually  some  tags  may  be  redundant  for 

annotating a multimedia resource. 

Of  course,  users  may  give  similar  tags  for  a  multime-
dia  resource.  For  example,  the  tags  ―apple  iPhone‖  may 
be  redundant  since  iPhone  is  very  semantic  similar  to 
apple.  

Heuristic 5. Usually some tags may be noisy for anno-

tating a multimedia resource. 

Users  may  give  inappropriate  or  even  false  tags  for  a 
multimedia resource. For example, the tags  ―iPhone‖ are 
false for an image about the iPod. 

4  GENERATING THE SEMANTIC LINK  

In this section, the computation model for generating the 
semantic link between multimedia resources is proposed. 
Based on the above five heuristics, the social tags provid-
ed by users are used in our computation model. Overall, 
the  proposed  computation  model  is  divided  into  three 
steps. 

(1) Tag relatedness computation. In this step, based on 
heuristic  1,  all  of  the  tag  pairs  between  two  multimedia 
resources are computed. 

(2) Semantic  relatedness  integration.  In  this  step, 
based on heuristics 3-5, the semantic relatedness between 
multimedia resources is computed. 

(3) Tag order revision. In this step, based on heuristic 2, 

the multimedia resources relatedness on step 2 is revised. 
Table 1 shows the variables and parameters used in the 
following discussion. Fig. 2 illustrates an overview of the 
proposed computation model. 

4.1  Tag Relatedness Computation 

According to definition 1, a multimedia resource can be 
represented as a set of tags provided by users. As for the 
semantic  relatedness  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources, 
we can measure the semantic relatedness between tags of 
these  multimedia  resources.  For  example,  two  multime-
dia resources with tags ―apple iPhone‖ and ―iPod Nano‖, 
we  can  measure  the  semantic  relatedness  between  these 
tags. Since the number of each tag is usually one accord-
ing  to  heuristic  1,  the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags 
can be computed without considering their weight.  

Many  different  methods  of  semantic  relatedness 
measures  between  concepts  have  been  proposed,  which 
can  be  divided  into  two  aspects  [27]:  taxonomy-based 
methods  and  web-based  methods.  Taxonomy-based 
methods  use  information  theory  and  hierarchical  taxon-
omy, such as WordNet, to measure semantic  relatedness. 
On the contrary, web-based methods use the web as a live 
and active corpus instead of hierarchical taxonomy.  

In  the  proposed  computation  model,  each  tag  can  be 
seen  as  a  concept  with  explicit  meaning.  Thus,  we  use 
some  equations  based  on  co-occurrence  of  two  concepts 
to  measure  their  semantic  relatedness.  The  core  idea  is 
that ‗you shall know a word by the company it keeps‘ [28]. 
In this section, four popular co-occurrence measures (i.e., 
Jaccard,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI  [29])  are  proposed  to 
measure semantic relatedness between tags. 

Besides  co-occurrence  measures,  the  page  counts  of 
each tag from search engine are used.  Page counts mean 
the number of web pages containing the query q. For ex-
ample,  the  page  counts  of  the  query  ‗Obama‘  in  Google4 
are 1,210,000,0005. Moreover, page counts for the query ‗q 
AND p‘ can be considered as a measure of co-occurrence 
of  queries  q  and  p.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we 
use  the  notation 
 to  denote  the  page  counts  of  the 
tag p in Google. However, the respective page counts for

Semantic Link Network based Model for 

Organizing Multimedia Big Data

Abstract—Recent research shows that multimedia resources “in the wild” are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In 
this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network model  is  used for  organizing multimedia  resources.  A  whole  model for  generating  the 
association relation between multimedia resources using Semantic Link Network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the Semantic Link 
Network  and  multimedia  resources  provides  a  new  prospect  for  organizing  them  with  their  semantics.  The  tags  and  the 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to  measure  their  semantic  association.  The  hierarchical  semantic  of 
multimedia resources are defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts 
are  different  in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic  Link  Network  model  are  implemented  to  measure 
association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two 
evaluation  methods  including  clustering  and  retrieval  are  performed,  which  shows  the  proposed  method  can  measure  the 
semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.

1  INTRODUCTION

R 

ECENTLY, Big data is an emerging paradigm applied 
to  datasets  whose  size  is  beyond  the  ability  of  com-
monly  used  software  tools  to  capture,  manage,  and  pro-
cess the data within a tolerable elapsed time [10]. Various 
technologies are being discussed to support the handling 
of  big  data  such  as  massively  parallel  processing  data-
bases [11], scalable storage systems [12, 33], cloud compu-
ting platforms [13, 34], and MapReduce [14, 35].   

Understanding  the  semantics  of  multimedia  has  been 
an  important  component  in  many  multimedia  based  ap-
plications. Manual annotation and tagging has been con-
sidered as a reliable source of multimedia semantics. Un-
fortunately,  manual  annotation  is  time-consuming  and 
expensive  when  dealing  with  huge  scale  of  multimedia 
data. Advances in Semantic Web [15] have made ontology 
another  useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  seman-
tics. Ontology builds a formal and explicit representation 
of  semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  rela-
tionships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive 
implicit  knowledge.  However,  the  semantic  gap  [16]  be-
tween  semantics  and  video  visual  appearance  is  still  a 
challenge  towards  automated  ontology-driven  video  an-
notation. With the rapid growth of video resources on the 
world-wide-web,  for  example,  on  YouTube 1  alone,  35 
hours  of  video  are  unloaded  every  minute  [2],  and  over 
700 billion videos were watched in 2010.  Vast amount of 
videos  with  no  metadata  have  emerged.  Thus  automati-
cally understanding raw multimedia solely based on their

visual  appearance  becomes  an  important  yet  challenging 
problem. Multimedia resources ―in the wild‖ are growing 
at  a  staggering  rate  [1,  2].  The  rapid  increase  number  of 
multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent  need  to  de-
velop intelligent methods to represent and annotate them. 
Typical  applications  in  which  representing  and  annotat-
ing  video  events  include  criminal  investigation  systems 
[3],  video  surveillance  [4],  intrusion  detection  system  [5], 
video  resources  browsing  and  indexing  system  [6],  sport 
events  detection  [7],  internet  of  things  [8,  9],  and  many 
others.  These  urgent  needs  have  posed  challenges  for 
multimedia  resources  management,  and  have  attracted 
the  research  of  the  multimedia  analysis  and  understand-
ing. Overall, the goal is to enable users to search the relat-
ed  resources  from  the  huge  number  of  multimedia  re-
sources.  

With  the  explosion  of  community  contributed  multi-
media content available online, many social media reposi-
tories (e.g. Flickr2, YouTube, and Zooomr3) allow users to 
upload media data and annotate content with descriptive 
keywords which are called social tags. Flickr provides an 
open  platform  for  users  to  publish  their  personal  images 
freely. The principal purpose of tagging is to make imag-
es  better  accessible  to  the  public.  The  success  of  Flickr 
proves that users are willing to participate in this seman-
tic context through manual annotations [17]. Flickr uses a 
promising  approach  for  manual  metadata  generation 
named  ―social  tagging‖,  which  requires  all  the  users  in 
the  social  network  label  the  multimedia  resources  with 
their own keywords and share with others. The character-
istics of social tags are as follows.

(1)  Ontology  free.  The  ontology  based  labeling  de-
fines  ontology  and  then  let  users  label  the  multimedia 
resources  using  the  semantic  markups  in  the  ontology. 
Social tagging requires all the users in the social network 
label the  multimedia resources with their  own keywords 
and share with others. Different from ontology based an-
notation.  There  is  no  pre-defined  ontology  or  taxonomy 
in  social  tagging.  Thus  the  tagging  task  is  more  conven-
ient for users.  

(2)  User  oriented.  The  users  can  annotate  images 
with their favorite tags. The tags of multimedia resources 
are  determined  by  users‘  cognitive  ability.  To  the  multi-
media resources, users may give different tags. Each mul-
timedia  resource  may  be  with  one  tag  at  least,  and  each 
tag may appear in many different multimedia resources. 

(3) 

Semantic  loss.  Irrelevant  social  tags  frequently 
appear,  and  users  typically  will  not  tag  all  semantic  ob-
jects in the image, which is called semantic loss. Polysemy, 
synonyms,  and  ambiguity  are  some  drawbacks  of  social 
tagging. 

In this paper, the Semantic Link Network (SLN) [18, 19, 
20]  model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources 
with  social  tags.  Semantic  Link  Network  is  designed  to 
establish  associated  relations  among  various  resources 
(e.g.,  Web  pages  or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming 
at extending the loosely connected network of no seman-
tics  (e.g.,  the  Web)  to  an  association-rich  network.  Since 
the theory of cognitive science considers that the associat-
ed  relations  can  make  one  resource  more  comprehensive 
to users [21], the motivation of SLN is to organize the as-
sociated  resources  loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  ef-
fectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as 
browsing,  knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness 
between  tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in 
the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  The  major  contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized as follow.  

(1) A  whole  model  for  generating  the  association  rela-
tion  between  multimedia  resources  using  Semantic  Link 
Network  model  is  proposed.  The  definitions,  modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used 
in the proposed method. The integration between the Se-
mantic Link Network and multimedia resources provides 
a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. 
(2) The  tags  and  the  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia 
resources are used to measure their semantic association.  
The  hierarchical  semantic  of  multimedia  resources  are 
defined  by  their  annotated  tags  and  surrounding  texts. 
The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different 
in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic 
Link Network model are implemented to measure associ-
ation relations. 

(3) A real data set including 100 thousand images with 
social  tags  from  Flickr  is  used  in  our  experiments.  Two 
evaluation methods including clustering and retrieval are 
performed, which shows the proposed method can meas-
ure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accu-
rately and robustly. 

(4) The  relatedness  measures  between  concepts  are  ex-

tended  to  the  level  of  multimedia.  Since  the  association 
relation  is  the  basic  mechanism  of  brain.  The  proposed 
Semantic Link Network based model can help the multi-
media  related  applications  such  as  searching  and  recom-
mendation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
gives  the  related  work  of  social  tags  and  semantic  link 
network. The problem definition is introduced in Section 
3.  Section  4  proposes  the  method  for  measuring  associa-
tion of multimedia. Experiments are presented in Section 
5. Conclusions are made in the last section. 

2  RELATED WORK 

Advances  in  Semantic  Web  have  made  ontology  another 
useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  semantics.  The 
ontology  builds  a  formal  and  explicit  representation  of 
semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  relation-
ships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive im-
plicit  knowledge.  In  this  section,  the  related  work  of  the 
proposed  model  is  given.  The  Semantic  Web  [15]  is  an 
evolving development of the World Wide Web, in which 
the meanings of information on the web is defined; there-
fore,  it  is  possible  for  machines  to  process  it.  The  basic 
idea  of  Semantic  Web  is  to  use  ontological  concepts  and 
vocabularies to accurately describe contents in a machine 
readable  way.  These  concepts  and  vocabularies  can  then 
be shared and retrieved on the web. In the Semantic Web, 
each fragment of the description is a triple, based on De-
scription  Logic.  Thus,  the  implicit  connections  and  se-
mantics within the description fragments can be reasoned 
using  Description  Logic  theory  and  ontological  defini-
tions. Earlier research work on the Semantic Web focused 
on  defining  domain  specific  ontologies  and  reasoning 
technologies.  Therefore,  data  are  only  meaningful  in  cer-
tain  domains  and  are  not  connected  to  each  other  from 
the World Wide Web point of view, which certainly limits 
the  contributions  of  Semantic  Web  for  sharing  and  re-
trieving contents within a distributed environment. 

The  Semantic  Link  Network  (SLN)  was  proposed  as  a 
semantic  data  model  for  organizing  various  Web  re-
sources  by  extending  the  Web‘s  hyperlink  to  a  semantic 
link.  SLN  is  a  directed  network  consisting  of  semantic 
nodes and semantic links. A semantic node can be a con-
cept, an instance of concept, a schema of data set, a URL, 
any  form  of  resources,  or  even  an  SLN.  A  semantic  link 
reflects  a  kind  of  relational  knowledge  represented  as  a 
pointer  with  a  tag  describing  such  semantic  relations  as 
cause  Effect,  implication,  subtype,  similar,  instance,  se-
quence,  reference,  and  equal.  The  semantics  of  tags  are 
usually common sense and can be regulated by its catego-
ry,  relevant  reasoning  rules,  and  use  cases.  A  set  of  gen-
eral  semantic  relation  reasoning  rules  was  suggested  in 
[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-
verse  relations  are  knowledge  for  supporting  semantic 
relation reasoning. SLN is a self-organized network since 
any node can link to any other node via a semantic link.

3.2 The Basic Definitions 

SLN  has  been  used  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  query 
routing  in  P2P  network  [24],  and  it  has  been  adopted  as 
one of the major mechanisms of organizing resources for 
the  Knowledge  Grid.  Pons  has  successfully  applied  the 
SLN  to  object  prefetching  and  achieved  a  better  result 
than other approaches [25]. 

3  THE SEMANTIC LINK NETWORK BASED MODEL  

The  tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources 
are  used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  related-
ness between tags and  surrounding texts are implement-
ed  in  the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  In  this  section, 
the  details  of  the  proposed  model  are  given.  The  basic 
definitions, representations, heuristics are introduced. 

3.1  The Basic Mechanisms of the Proposed Model 
SLN can be formalized into a loosely coupled semantic 
model for managing various resources. As a data model, 
the  proposed  model  consists  of  the  following  parts,  as 
shown in Fig. 1. 

1)  Resources  representation  mechanism.  Element 
Fuzzy  Cognitive  Map  (E-FCM)  [19]  is  used  to  represent 
multimedia  resources  with  social  tags  since  it  does  not 
only  reserve  resources‘  keywords  but  also  the  relations 
among them. 

2)  Resources  storage  mechanism.  Database/XML  is 
used to store E-FCM since it is easy to define the mark-up 
elements. 

3)  SLN  generation  mechanism.  Based  on  E-FCM  and 
the  association  rules,  ALN  can  be  generated  by  machine 
automatically.  

4)  Application  mechanism.  SLN  can  be  used  for  Web 
intelligence  activities,  Web  knowledge  discovery  and 
publishing,  etc.  For  example,  when  a  user  browses  mul-
timedia,  other  resources  with  semantic  links  to  it  can  be 
recommended to the user. 

The  three  important  definitions  are  defined  firstly  in 
this  paper  including  the  social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia 
resource and the semantic relatedness between two  mul-
timedia resources. 

Definition  1:  Social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia  resource. 
The  social  tags  (denoted  by  t)  set  of  a  multimedia  re-
source f (denoted by s(f)) is a set of tags provided by users. 

                    (1) 

Definition  2:  Semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The 
) 

semantic  relatedness  between  tags  (denoted  by 

is the expected correlation of a pair of tags 

 and 

. 

Definition  3:  Semantic  relatedness  between  two  mul-
timedia  resources.  The  semantic  relatedness  between 
multimedia  resources  (denoted  by
)  is  the  ex-

pected  correlation  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources 

and 

. 

The range of 

 is from 0 to 1. A high value indi-

cates that semantic relatedness between tags is more like-
ly to be confidential.  

3.3  The Basic Heuristics 

Based  on  common  sense  and  our  observations  on  real 
data, five heuristics that serve as the base of the proposed 
computation model are given as follow. 

Heuristic 1. Usually each tag of a multimedia resource 

appears only one time. 

Different  from  writing  sentences,  users  usually  anno-
tate a multimedia resource with different tags. For exam-
ple,  the  possibility  of  using  tags  ―apple  apple  apple‖  for 
an image is very low. Therefore, in this paper, we do not 
employ any weighting scheme for tags such as tf-idf [26]. 
Heuristic 2. The order of the tags may reflect the corre-

lation against the annotated multimedia resource. 

Different tag reflects the different aspect of a multime-
dia resource. According to Heuristic 1, the weight of a tag

Heuristic  3.  The  number  of  tags  of  a  multimedia  re-

source may not relevant to the annotation correctness. 

Different users may give different tags about the same 
multimedia  resource.  For  example,  users  may  give  tags 
such as ―apple iPhone‖ or ―iPhone4 mobile phone‖ for  a 
same image about iPhone. It is hardly to say which tag is 
better  for  annotation  though  the  latter  annotation  has 
three tags. 

Heuristic  4.  Usually  some  tags  may  be  redundant  for 

annotating a multimedia resource. 

Of  course,  users  may  give  similar  tags  for  a  multime-
dia  resource.  For  example,  the  tags  ―apple  iPhone‖  may 
be  redundant  since  iPhone  is  very  semantic  similar  to 
apple.  

Heuristic 5. Usually some tags may be noisy for anno-

tating a multimedia resource. 

Users  may  give  inappropriate  or  even  false  tags  for  a 
multimedia resource. For example, the tags  ―iPhone‖ are 
false for an image about the iPod. 

4  GENERATING THE SEMANTIC LINK  

In this section, the computation model for generating the 
semantic link between multimedia resources is proposed. 
Based on the above five heuristics, the social tags provid-
ed by users are used in our computation model. Overall, 
the  proposed  computation  model  is  divided  into  three 
steps. 

(1) Tag relatedness computation. In this step, based on 
heuristic  1,  all  of  the  tag  pairs  between  two  multimedia 
resources are computed. 

(2) Semantic  relatedness  integration.  In  this  step, 
based on heuristics 3-5, the semantic relatedness between 
multimedia resources is computed. 

(3) Tag order revision. In this step, based on heuristic 2, 

the multimedia resources relatedness on step 2 is revised. 
Table 1 shows the variables and parameters used in the 
following discussion. Fig. 2 illustrates an overview of the 
proposed computation model. 

4.1  Tag Relatedness Computation 

According to definition 1, a multimedia resource can be 
represented as a set of tags provided by users. As for the 
semantic  relatedness  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources, 
we can measure the semantic relatedness between tags of 
these  multimedia  resources.  For  example,  two  multime-
dia resources with tags ―apple iPhone‖ and ―iPod Nano‖, 
we  can  measure  the  semantic  relatedness  between  these 
tags. Since the number of each tag is usually one accord-
ing  to  heuristic  1,  the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags 
can be computed without considering their weight.  

Many  different  methods  of  semantic  relatedness 
measures  between  concepts  have  been  proposed,  which 
can  be  divided  into  two  aspects  [27]:  taxonomy-based 
methods  and  web-based  methods.  Taxonomy-based 
methods  use  information  theory  and  hierarchical  taxon-
omy, such as WordNet, to measure semantic  relatedness. 
On the contrary, web-based methods use the web as a live 
and active corpus instead of hierarchical taxonomy.  

In  the  proposed  computation  model,  each  tag  can  be 
seen  as  a  concept  with  explicit  meaning.  Thus,  we  use 
some  equations  based  on  co-occurrence  of  two  concepts 
to  measure  their  semantic  relatedness.  The  core  idea  is 
that ‗you shall know a word by the company it keeps‘ [28]. 
In this section, four popular co-occurrence measures (i.e., 
Jaccard,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI  [29])  are  proposed  to 
measure semantic relatedness between tags. 

Besides  co-occurrence  measures,  the  page  counts  of 
each tag from search engine are used.  Page counts mean 
the number of web pages containing the query q. For ex-
ample,  the  page  counts  of  the  query  ‗Obama‘  in  Google4 
are 1,210,000,0005. Moreover, page counts for the query ‗q 
AND p‘ can be considered as a measure of co-occurrence 
of  queries  q  and  p.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we 
use  the  notation 
 to  denote  the  page  counts  of  the 
tag p in Google. However, the respective page counts for

the tag pair p and q are not enough for measuring seman-
 
tic relatedness. The page counts for the query ‗p AND q‘ 
 
should  be  considered.  For  example,  when  we  query 
 
‗Obama‘  and  ‗United  States‘  in  Google,  we  can  find 
 
485,000,000  Web  pages,  that  is,

next section, we will give the detailed analysis for choos-
ing the best measures from equations 2-5.  

Overall,  the  page  counts  of  each  tag  should  be  issued. 
Then the co-occurrence based measure is used to compute 
the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The  reasons  for 
using page counts based measures are as follow. 

(1)  Appropriate  computation  complexity.  Since  the 
relatedness  between  each  tag  pair  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources should be computed, the proposed method must 
be  with  low  complexity.  Recently,  web  search  engines 
such  as  Google  provide  API  for  users  to  index  the  page 
counts  of  each  query.  The  web  search  engine  gives  an 
appropriate interface for the proposed computation mod-
el. 

(2)  Explicit  semantics.  The  tag  given  by  users  may 
not be a correct concept in taxonomy. For example, users 
may  give  a  tag  ―Bling  Bling‖  for  a  multimedia  resource 
about  a  lovely  girl.  The  word  ―Bling‖  cannot  be  indexed

Semantic Link Network based Model for 

Organizing Multimedia Big Data

Member, IEEE，Lan Chen, and Xiangfeng Luo, Member, IEEE 

Abstract—Recent research shows that multimedia resources “in the wild” are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In 
this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network model  is  used for  organizing multimedia  resources.  A  whole  model for  generating  the 
association relation between multimedia resources using Semantic Link Network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the Semantic Link 
Network  and  multimedia  resources  provides  a  new  prospect  for  organizing  them  with  their  semantics.  The  tags  and  the 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to  measure  their  semantic  association.  The  hierarchical  semantic  of 
multimedia resources are defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts 
are  different  in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic  Link  Network  model  are  implemented  to  measure 
association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two 
evaluation  methods  including  clustering  and  retrieval  are  performed,  which  shows  the  proposed  method  can  measure  the 
semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.

1  INTRODUCTION

R 

ECENTLY, Big data is an emerging paradigm applied 
to  datasets  whose  size  is  beyond  the  ability  of  com-
monly  used  software  tools  to  capture,  manage,  and  pro-
cess the data within a tolerable elapsed time [10]. Various 
technologies are being discussed to support the handling 
of  big  data  such  as  massively  parallel  processing  data-
bases [11], scalable storage systems [12, 33], cloud compu-
ting platforms [13, 34], and MapReduce [14, 35].   

Understanding  the  semantics  of  multimedia  has  been 
an  important  component  in  many  multimedia  based  ap-
plications. Manual annotation and tagging has been con-
sidered as a reliable source of multimedia semantics. Un-
fortunately,  manual  annotation  is  time-consuming  and 
expensive  when  dealing  with  huge  scale  of  multimedia 
data. Advances in Semantic Web [15] have made ontology 
another  useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  seman-
tics. Ontology builds a formal and explicit representation 
of  semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  rela-
tionships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive 
implicit  knowledge.  However,  the  semantic  gap  [16]  be-
tween  semantics  and  video  visual  appearance  is  still  a 
challenge  towards  automated  ontology-driven  video  an-
notation. With the rapid growth of video resources on the 
world-wide-web,  for  example,  on  YouTube 1  alone,  35 
hours  of  video  are  unloaded  every  minute  [2],  and  over 
700 billion videos were watched in 2010.  Vast amount of 
videos  with  no  metadata  have  emerged.  Thus  automati-
cally understanding raw multimedia solely based on their

visual  appearance  becomes  an  important  yet  challenging 
problem. Multimedia resources ―in the wild‖ are growing 
at  a  staggering  rate  [1,  2].  The  rapid  increase  number  of 
multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent  need  to  de-
velop intelligent methods to represent and annotate them. 
Typical  applications  in  which  representing  and  annotat-
ing  video  events  include  criminal  investigation  systems 
[3],  video  surveillance  [4],  intrusion  detection  system  [5], 
video  resources  browsing  and  indexing  system  [6],  sport 
events  detection  [7],  internet  of  things  [8,  9],  and  many 
others.  These  urgent  needs  have  posed  challenges  for 
multimedia  resources  management,  and  have  attracted 
the  research  of  the  multimedia  analysis  and  understand-
ing. Overall, the goal is to enable users to search the relat-
ed  resources  from  the  huge  number  of  multimedia  re-
sources.  

With  the  explosion  of  community  contributed  multi-
media content available online, many social media reposi-
tories (e.g. Flickr2, YouTube, and Zooomr3) allow users to 
upload media data and annotate content with descriptive 
keywords which are called social tags. Flickr provides an 
open  platform  for  users  to  publish  their  personal  images 
freely. The principal purpose of tagging is to make imag-
es  better  accessible  to  the  public.  The  success  of  Flickr 
proves that users are willing to participate in this seman-
tic context through manual annotations [17]. Flickr uses a 
promising  approach  for  manual  metadata  generation 
named  ―social  tagging‖,  which  requires  all  the  users  in 
the  social  network  label  the  multimedia  resources  with 
their own keywords and share with others. The character-
istics of social tags are as follows.

(1)  Ontology  free.  The  ontology  based  labeling  de-
fines  ontology  and  then  let  users  label  the  multimedia 
resources  using  the  semantic  markups  in  the  ontology. 
Social tagging requires all the users in the social network 
label the  multimedia resources with their  own keywords 
and share with others. Different from ontology based an-
notation.  There  is  no  pre-defined  ontology  or  taxonomy 
in  social  tagging.  Thus  the  tagging  task  is  more  conven-
ient for users.  

(2)  User  oriented.  The  users  can  annotate  images 
with their favorite tags. The tags of multimedia resources 
are  determined  by  users‘  cognitive  ability.  To  the  multi-
media resources, users may give different tags. Each mul-
timedia  resource  may  be  with  one  tag  at  least,  and  each 
tag may appear in many different multimedia resources. 

(3) 

Semantic  loss.  Irrelevant  social  tags  frequently 
appear,  and  users  typically  will  not  tag  all  semantic  ob-
jects in the image, which is called semantic loss. Polysemy, 
synonyms,  and  ambiguity  are  some  drawbacks  of  social 
tagging. 

In this paper, the Semantic Link Network (SLN) [18, 19, 
20]  model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources 
with  social  tags.  Semantic  Link  Network  is  designed  to 
establish  associated  relations  among  various  resources 
(e.g.,  Web  pages  or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming 
at extending the loosely connected network of no seman-
tics  (e.g.,  the  Web)  to  an  association-rich  network.  Since 
the theory of cognitive science considers that the associat-
ed  relations  can  make  one  resource  more  comprehensive 
to users [21], the motivation of SLN is to organize the as-
sociated  resources  loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  ef-
fectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as 
browsing,  knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness 
between  tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in 
the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  The  major  contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized as follow.  

(1) A  whole  model  for  generating  the  association  rela-
tion  between  multimedia  resources  using  Semantic  Link 
Network  model  is  proposed.  The  definitions,  modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used 
in the proposed method. The integration between the Se-
mantic Link Network and multimedia resources provides 
a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. 
(2) The  tags  and  the  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia 
resources are used to measure their semantic association.  
The  hierarchical  semantic  of  multimedia  resources  are 
defined  by  their  annotated  tags  and  surrounding  texts. 
The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different 
in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic 
Link Network model are implemented to measure associ-
ation relations. 

(3) A real data set including 100 thousand images with 
social  tags  from  Flickr  is  used  in  our  experiments.  Two 
evaluation methods including clustering and retrieval are 
performed, which shows the proposed method can meas-
ure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accu-
rately and robustly. 

(4) The  relatedness  measures  between  concepts  are  ex-

tended  to  the  level  of  multimedia.  Since  the  association 
relation  is  the  basic  mechanism  of  brain.  The  proposed 
Semantic Link Network based model can help the multi-
media  related  applications  such  as  searching  and  recom-
mendation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
gives  the  related  work  of  social  tags  and  semantic  link 
network. The problem definition is introduced in Section 
3.  Section  4  proposes  the  method  for  measuring  associa-
tion of multimedia. Experiments are presented in Section 
5. Conclusions are made in the last section. 

2  RELATED WORK 

Advances  in  Semantic  Web  have  made  ontology  another 
useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  semantics.  The 
ontology  builds  a  formal  and  explicit  representation  of 
semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  relation-
ships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive im-
plicit  knowledge.  In  this  section,  the  related  work  of  the 
proposed  model  is  given.  The  Semantic  Web  [15]  is  an 
evolving development of the World Wide Web, in which 
the meanings of information on the web is defined; there-
fore,  it  is  possible  for  machines  to  process  it.  The  basic 
idea  of  Semantic  Web  is  to  use  ontological  concepts  and 
vocabularies to accurately describe contents in a machine 
readable  way.  These  concepts  and  vocabularies  can  then 
be shared and retrieved on the web. In the Semantic Web, 
each fragment of the description is a triple, based on De-
scription  Logic.  Thus,  the  implicit  connections  and  se-
mantics within the description fragments can be reasoned 
using  Description  Logic  theory  and  ontological  defini-
tions. Earlier research work on the Semantic Web focused 
on  defining  domain  specific  ontologies  and  reasoning 
technologies.  Therefore,  data  are  only  meaningful  in  cer-
tain  domains  and  are  not  connected  to  each  other  from 
the World Wide Web point of view, which certainly limits 
the  contributions  of  Semantic  Web  for  sharing  and  re-
trieving contents within a distributed environment. 

The  Semantic  Link  Network  (SLN)  was  proposed  as  a 
semantic  data  model  for  organizing  various  Web  re-
sources  by  extending  the  Web‘s  hyperlink  to  a  semantic 
link.  SLN  is  a  directed  network  consisting  of  semantic 
nodes and semantic links. A semantic node can be a con-
cept, an instance of concept, a schema of data set, a URL, 
any  form  of  resources,  or  even  an  SLN.  A  semantic  link 
reflects  a  kind  of  relational  knowledge  represented  as  a 
pointer  with  a  tag  describing  such  semantic  relations  as 
cause  Effect,  implication,  subtype,  similar,  instance,  se-
quence,  reference,  and  equal.  The  semantics  of  tags  are 
usually common sense and can be regulated by its catego-
ry,  relevant  reasoning  rules,  and  use  cases.  A  set  of  gen-
eral  semantic  relation  reasoning  rules  was  suggested  in 
[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-
verse  relations  are  knowledge  for  supporting  semantic 
relation reasoning. SLN is a self-organized network since 
any node can link to any other node via a semantic link.

SLN  has  been  used  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  query 
routing  in  P2P  network  [24],  and  it  has  been  adopted  as 
one of the major mechanisms of organizing resources for 
the  Knowledge  Grid.  Pons  has  successfully  applied  the 
SLN  to  object  prefetching  and  achieved  a  better  result 
than other approaches [25].

The  tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources 
are  used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  related-
ness between tags and  surrounding texts are implement-
ed  in  the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  In  this  section, 
the  details  of  the  proposed  model  are  given.  The  basic 
definitions, representations, heuristics are introduced. 

3.1  The Basic Mechanisms of the Proposed Model 
SLN can be formalized into a loosely coupled semantic 
model for managing various resources. As a data model, 
the  proposed  model  consists  of  the  following  parts,  as 
shown in Fig. 1. 

1)  Resources  representation  mechanism.  Element 
Fuzzy  Cognitive  Map  (E-FCM)  [19]  is  used  to  represent 
multimedia  resources  with  social  tags  since  it  does  not 
only  reserve  resources‘  keywords  but  also  the  relations 
among them. 

2)  Resources  storage  mechanism.  Database/XML  is 
used to store E-FCM since it is easy to define the mark-up 
elements. 

3)  SLN  generation  mechanism.  Based  on  E-FCM  and 
the  association  rules,  ALN  can  be  generated  by  machine 
automatically.  

4)  Application  mechanism.  SLN  can  be  used  for  Web 
intelligence  activities,  Web  knowledge  discovery  and 
publishing,  etc.  For  example,  when  a  user  browses  mul-
timedia,  other  resources  with  semantic  links  to  it  can  be 
recommended to the user. 

The  three  important  definitions  are  defined  firstly  in 
this  paper  including  the  social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia 
resource and the semantic relatedness between two  mul-
timedia resources. 

Definition  1:  Social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia  resource. 
The  social  tags  (denoted  by  t)  set  of  a  multimedia  re-
source f (denoted by s(f)) is a set of tags provided by users. 

                    (1) 

Definition  2:  Semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The 
) 

semantic  relatedness  between  tags  (denoted  by 

is the expected correlation of a pair of tags 

 and 

. 

Definition  3:  Semantic  relatedness  between  two  mul-
timedia  resources.  The  semantic  relatedness  between 
multimedia  resources  (denoted  by
)  is  the  ex-

pected  correlation  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources 

and 

. 

The range of 

 is from 0 to 1. A high value indi-

cates that semantic relatedness between tags is more like-
ly to be confidential.  

3.3  The Basic Heuristics 

Based  on  common  sense  and  our  observations  on  real 
data, five heuristics that serve as the base of the proposed 
computation model are given as follow. 

Heuristic 1. Usually each tag of a multimedia resource 

appears only one time. 

Different  from  writing  sentences,  users  usually  anno-
tate a multimedia resource with different tags. For exam-
ple,  the  possibility  of  using  tags  ―apple  apple  apple‖  for 
an image is very low. Therefore, in this paper, we do not 
employ any weighting scheme for tags such as tf-idf [26]. 
Heuristic 2. The order of the tags may reflect the corre-

lation against the annotated multimedia resource. 

Different tag reflects the different aspect of a multime-
dia resource. According to Heuristic 1, the weight of a tag 
against  the  image  cannot  be  obtained.  Fortunately,  the 
order  of  the  tags  can  be  get  since  user  may  provide  tags

one by one.  

Heuristic  3.  The  number  of  tags  of  a  multimedia  re-

source may not relevant to the annotation correctness. 

Different users may give different tags about the same 
multimedia  resource.  For  example,  users  may  give  tags 
such as ―apple iPhone‖ or ―iPhone4 mobile phone‖ for  a 
same image about iPhone. It is hardly to say which tag is 
better  for  annotation  though  the  latter  annotation  has 
three tags. 

Heuristic  4.  Usually  some  tags  may  be  redundant  for 

annotating a multimedia resource. 

Of  course,  users  may  give  similar  tags  for  a  multime-
dia  resource.  For  example,  the  tags  ―apple  iPhone‖  may 
be  redundant  since  iPhone  is  very  semantic  similar  to 
apple.  

Heuristic 5. Usually some tags may be noisy for anno-

tating a multimedia resource. 

Users  may  give  inappropriate  or  even  false  tags  for  a 
multimedia resource. For example, the tags  ―iPhone‖ are 
false for an image about the iPod. 

4  GENERATING THE SEMANTIC LINK  

In this section, the computation model for generating the 
semantic link between multimedia resources is proposed. 
Based on the above five heuristics, the social tags provid-
ed by users are used in our computation model. Overall, 
the  proposed  computation  model  is  divided  into  three 
steps. 

(1) Tag relatedness computation. In this step, based on 
heuristic  1,  all  of  the  tag  pairs  between  two  multimedia 
resources are computed. 

(2) Semantic  relatedness  integration.  In  this  step, 
based on heuristics 3-5, the semantic relatedness between 
multimedia resources is computed. 

(3) Tag order revision. In this step, based on heuristic 2, 

the multimedia resources relatedness on step 2 is revised. 
Table 1 shows the variables and parameters used in the 
following discussion. Fig. 2 illustrates an overview of the 
proposed computation model. 

4.1  Tag Relatedness Computation 

According to definition 1, a multimedia resource can be 
represented as a set of tags provided by users. As for the 
semantic  relatedness  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources, 
we can measure the semantic relatedness between tags of 
these  multimedia  resources.  For  example,  two  multime-
dia resources with tags ―apple iPhone‖ and ―iPod Nano‖, 
we  can  measure  the  semantic  relatedness  between  these 
tags. Since the number of each tag is usually one accord-
ing  to  heuristic  1,  the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags 
can be computed without considering their weight.  

Many  different  methods  of  semantic  relatedness 
measures  between  concepts  have  been  proposed,  which 
can  be  divided  into  two  aspects  [27]:  taxonomy-based 
methods  and  web-based  methods.  Taxonomy-based 
methods  use  information  theory  and  hierarchical  taxon-
omy, such as WordNet, to measure semantic  relatedness. 
On the contrary, web-based methods use the web as a live 
and active corpus instead of hierarchical taxonomy.  

In  the  proposed  computation  model,  each  tag  can  be 
seen  as  a  concept  with  explicit  meaning.  Thus,  we  use 
some  equations  based  on  co-occurrence  of  two  concepts 
to  measure  their  semantic  relatedness.  The  core  idea  is 
that ‗you shall know a word by the company it keeps‘ [28]. 
In this section, four popular co-occurrence measures (i.e., 
Jaccard,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI  [29])  are  proposed  to 
measure semantic relatedness between tags. 

Besides  co-occurrence  measures,  the  page  counts  of 
each tag from search engine are used.  Page counts mean 
the number of web pages containing the query q. For ex-
ample,  the  page  counts  of  the  query  ‗Obama‘  in  Google4 
are 1,210,000,0005. Moreover, page counts for the query ‗q 
AND p‘ can be considered as a measure of co-occurrence 
of  queries  q  and  p.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we 
use  the  notation 
 to  denote  the  page  counts  of  the 
tag p in Google. However, the respective page counts for

the tag pair p and q are not enough for measuring seman-
 
tic relatedness. The page counts for the query ‗p AND q‘ 
 
should  be  considered.  For  example,  when  we  query 
 
‗Obama‘  and  ‗United  States‘  in  Google,  we  can  find 
 
485,000,000  Web  pages,  that  is, 
 
=485,000,000.  The  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card, Overlap, Dice, and PMI) between two tags p and q 
are as follows:

equation can be:

According to probability and information theory, the mu-
tual information (MI) of two random variables is a quanti-
ty that measures the mutual dependence of the two vari-
ables. Pointwise mutual information (PMI) is a variant of 
MI (Equation (5)):

where N is the number of Web pages in the search engine, 
which  is  set  to

latedness as follows:

sources

                           (7) 

next section, we will give the detailed analysis for choos-
ing the best measures from equations 2-5.  

Overall,  the  page  counts  of  each  tag  should  be  issued. 
Then the co-occurrence based measure is used to compute 
the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The  reasons  for 
using page counts based measures are as follow. 

(1)  Appropriate  computation  complexity.  Since  the 
relatedness  between  each  tag  pair  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources should be computed, the proposed method must 
be  with  low  complexity.  Recently,  web  search  engines 
such  as  Google  provide  API  for  users  to  index  the  page 
counts  of  each  query.  The  web  search  engine  gives  an 
appropriate interface for the proposed computation mod-
el. 

(2)  Explicit  semantics.  The  tag  given  by  users  may 
not be a correct concept in taxonomy. For example, users 
may  give  a  tag  ―Bling  Bling‖  for  a  multimedia  resource 
about  a  lovely  girl.  The  word  ―Bling‖  cannot  be  indexed

 can  be 
treated as a bipartite graph, which is denoted as

graphs, we have

Based  on  the  equation  11,  we  change  the  semantic  re-
latedness integration of all tag pairs to the  assignment in 
bipartite graph problem. We want to assign a best match-
ing of the bipartite graph G.  

A matching is defined as 

so that no two edges in 
M share a common end vertex. An assignment in a bipar-
tite graph is a matching M so that each node of the graph 
has an incident edge in M. Suppose that the set of vertices 
are partitioned in two sets 
and , and that the edges of 
the graph have an associated weight given by a  function

.  The  function  maxRel: 

returns  the  maximum  weighted  assignment,  i.e.,  an  as-
signment  so  that  the average  of  the  weights  of  the edges

cardinality  of

the  number  of  tags  is  reduced,  and  the  semantic  related-
ness of two multimedia resources is symmetric.

Semantic Link Network based Model for 

Organizing Multimedia Big Data 

Chuanping Hu, Member, IEEE, Zheng Xu, Member, IEEE, Yunhuai Liu, Member, IEEE, Lin Mei, 

Member, IEEE，Lan Chen, and Xiangfeng Luo, Member, IEEE 

Abstract—Recent research shows that multimedia resources “in the wild” are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In 
this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network model  is  used for  organizing multimedia  resources.  A  whole  model for  generating  the 
association relation between multimedia resources using Semantic Link Network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the Semantic Link 
Network  and  multimedia  resources  provides  a  new  prospect  for  organizing  them  with  their  semantics.  The  tags  and  the 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to  measure  their  semantic  association.  The  hierarchical  semantic  of 
multimedia resources are defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts 
are  different  in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic  Link  Network  model  are  implemented  to  measure 
association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two 
evaluation  methods  including  clustering  and  retrieval  are  performed,  which  shows  the  proposed  method  can  measure  the 
semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.

1  INTRODUCTION

R 

ECENTLY, Big data is an emerging paradigm applied 
to  datasets  whose  size  is  beyond  the  ability  of  com-
monly  used  software  tools  to  capture,  manage,  and  pro-
cess the data within a tolerable elapsed time [10]. Various 
technologies are being discussed to support the handling 
of  big  data  such  as  massively  parallel  processing  data-
bases [11], scalable storage systems [12, 33], cloud compu-
ting platforms [13, 34], and MapReduce [14, 35].   

Understanding  the  semantics  of  multimedia  has  been 
an  important  component  in  many  multimedia  based  ap-
plications. Manual annotation and tagging has been con-
sidered as a reliable source of multimedia semantics. Un-
fortunately,  manual  annotation  is  time-consuming  and 
expensive  when  dealing  with  huge  scale  of  multimedia 
data. Advances in Semantic Web [15] have made ontology 
another  useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  seman-
tics. Ontology builds a formal and explicit representation 
of  semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  rela-
tionships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive 
implicit  knowledge.  However,  the  semantic  gap  [16]  be-
tween  semantics  and  video  visual  appearance  is  still  a 
challenge  towards  automated  ontology-driven  video  an-
notation. With the rapid growth of video resources on the 
world-wide-web,  for  example,  on  YouTube 1  alone,  35 
hours  of  video  are  unloaded  every  minute  [2],  and  over 
700 billion videos were watched in 2010.  Vast amount of 
videos  with  no  metadata  have  emerged.  Thus  automati-
cally understanding raw multimedia solely based on their

visual  appearance  becomes  an  important  yet  challenging 
problem. Multimedia resources ―in the wild‖ are growing 
at  a  staggering  rate  [1,  2].  The  rapid  increase  number  of 
multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent  need  to  de-
velop intelligent methods to represent and annotate them. 
Typical  applications  in  which  representing  and  annotat-
ing  video  events  include  criminal  investigation  systems 
[3],  video  surveillance  [4],  intrusion  detection  system  [5], 
video  resources  browsing  and  indexing  system  [6],  sport 
events  detection  [7],  internet  of  things  [8,  9],  and  many 
others.  These  urgent  needs  have  posed  challenges  for 
multimedia  resources  management,  and  have  attracted 
the  research  of  the  multimedia  analysis  and  understand-
ing. Overall, the goal is to enable users to search the relat-
ed  resources  from  the  huge  number  of  multimedia  re-
sources.  

With  the  explosion  of  community  contributed  multi-
media content available online, many social media reposi-
tories (e.g. Flickr2, YouTube, and Zooomr3) allow users to 
upload media data and annotate content with descriptive 
keywords which are called social tags. Flickr provides an 
open  platform  for  users  to  publish  their  personal  images 
freely. The principal purpose of tagging is to make imag-
es  better  accessible  to  the  public.  The  success  of  Flickr 
proves that users are willing to participate in this seman-
tic context through manual annotations [17]. Flickr uses a 
promising  approach  for  manual  metadata  generation 
named  ―social  tagging‖,  which  requires  all  the  users  in 
the  social  network  label  the  multimedia  resources  with 
their own keywords and share with others. The character-
istics of social tags are as follows.

(1)  Ontology  free.  The  ontology  based  labeling  de-
fines  ontology  and  then  let  users  label  the  multimedia 
resources  using  the  semantic  markups  in  the  ontology. 
Social tagging requires all the users in the social network 
label the  multimedia resources with their  own keywords 
and share with others. Different from ontology based an-
notation.  There  is  no  pre-defined  ontology  or  taxonomy 
in  social  tagging.  Thus  the  tagging  task  is  more  conven-
ient for users.  

(2)  User  oriented.  The  users  can  annotate  images 
with their favorite tags. The tags of multimedia resources 
are  determined  by  users‘  cognitive  ability.  To  the  multi-
media resources, users may give different tags. Each mul-
timedia  resource  may  be  with  one  tag  at  least,  and  each 
tag may appear in many different multimedia resources. 

(3) 

Semantic  loss.  Irrelevant  social  tags  frequently 
appear,  and  users  typically  will  not  tag  all  semantic  ob-
jects in the image, which is called semantic loss. Polysemy, 
synonyms,  and  ambiguity  are  some  drawbacks  of  social 
tagging. 

In this paper, the Semantic Link Network (SLN) [18, 19, 
20]  model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources 
with  social  tags.  Semantic  Link  Network  is  designed  to 
establish  associated  relations  among  various  resources 
(e.g.,  Web  pages  or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming 
at extending the loosely connected network of no seman-
tics  (e.g.,  the  Web)  to  an  association-rich  network.  Since 
the theory of cognitive science considers that the associat-
ed  relations  can  make  one  resource  more  comprehensive 
to users [21], the motivation of SLN is to organize the as-
sociated  resources  loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  ef-
fectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as 
browsing,  knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness 
between  tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in 
the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  The  major  contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized as follow.  

(1) A  whole  model  for  generating  the  association  rela-
tion  between  multimedia  resources  using  Semantic  Link 
Network  model  is  proposed.  The  definitions,  modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used 
in the proposed method. The integration between the Se-
mantic Link Network and multimedia resources provides 
a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. 
(2) The  tags  and  the  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia 
resources are used to measure their semantic association.  
The  hierarchical  semantic  of  multimedia  resources  are 
defined  by  their  annotated  tags  and  surrounding  texts. 
The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different 
in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic 
Link Network model are implemented to measure associ-
ation relations. 

(3) A real data set including 100 thousand images with 
social  tags  from  Flickr  is  used  in  our  experiments.  Two 
evaluation methods including clustering and retrieval are 
performed, which shows the proposed method can meas-
ure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accu-
rately and robustly. 

(4) The  relatedness  measures  between  concepts  are  ex-

tended  to  the  level  of  multimedia.  Since  the  association 
relation  is  the  basic  mechanism  of  brain.  The  proposed 
Semantic Link Network based model can help the multi-
media  related  applications  such  as  searching  and  recom-
mendation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
gives  the  related  work  of  social  tags  and  semantic  link 
network. The problem definition is introduced in Section 
3.  Section  4  proposes  the  method  for  measuring  associa-
tion of multimedia. Experiments are presented in Section 
5. Conclusions are made in the last section. 

2  RELATED WORK 

Advances  in  Semantic  Web  have  made  ontology  another 
useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  semantics.  The 
ontology  builds  a  formal  and  explicit  representation  of 
semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  relation-
ships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive im-
plicit  knowledge.  In  this  section,  the  related  work  of  the 
proposed  model  is  given.  The  Semantic  Web  [15]  is  an 
evolving development of the World Wide Web, in which 
the meanings of information on the web is defined; there-
fore,  it  is  possible  for  machines  to  process  it.  The  basic 
idea  of  Semantic  Web  is  to  use  ontological  concepts  and 
vocabularies to accurately describe contents in a machine 
readable  way.  These  concepts  and  vocabularies  can  then 
be shared and retrieved on the web. In the Semantic Web, 
each fragment of the description is a triple, based on De-
scription  Logic.  Thus,  the  implicit  connections  and  se-
mantics within the description fragments can be reasoned 
using  Description  Logic  theory  and  ontological  defini-
tions. Earlier research work on the Semantic Web focused 
on  defining  domain  specific  ontologies  and  reasoning 
technologies.  Therefore,  data  are  only  meaningful  in  cer-
tain  domains  and  are  not  connected  to  each  other  from 
the World Wide Web point of view, which certainly limits 
the  contributions  of  Semantic  Web  for  sharing  and  re-
trieving contents within a distributed environment. 

The  Semantic  Link  Network  (SLN)  was  proposed  as  a 
semantic  data  model  for  organizing  various  Web  re-
sources  by  extending  the  Web‘s  hyperlink  to  a  semantic 
link.  SLN  is  a  directed  network  consisting  of  semantic 
nodes and semantic links. A semantic node can be a con-
cept, an instance of concept, a schema of data set, a URL, 
any  form  of  resources,  or  even  an  SLN.  A  semantic  link 
reflects  a  kind  of  relational  knowledge  represented  as  a 
pointer  with  a  tag  describing  such  semantic  relations  as 
cause  Effect,  implication,  subtype,  similar,  instance,  se-
quence,  reference,  and  equal.  The  semantics  of  tags  are 
usually common sense and can be regulated by its catego-
ry,  relevant  reasoning  rules,  and  use  cases.  A  set  of  gen-
eral  semantic  relation  reasoning  rules  was  suggested  in 
[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-
verse  relations  are  knowledge  for  supporting  semantic 
relation reasoning. SLN is a self-organized network since 
any node can link to any other node via a semantic link.

3.2 The Basic Definitions 

SLN  has  been  used  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  query 
routing  in  P2P  network  [24],  and  it  has  been  adopted  as 
one of the major mechanisms of organizing resources for 
the  Knowledge  Grid.  Pons  has  successfully  applied  the 
SLN  to  object  prefetching  and  achieved  a  better  result 
than other approaches [25]. 

3  THE SEMANTIC LINK NETWORK BASED MODEL  

The  tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources 
are  used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  related-
ness between tags and  surrounding texts are implement-
ed  in  the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  In  this  section, 
the  details  of  the  proposed  model  are  given.  The  basic 
definitions, representations, heuristics are introduced. 

3.1  The Basic Mechanisms of the Proposed Model 
SLN can be formalized into a loosely coupled semantic 
model for managing various resources. As a data model, 
the  proposed  model  consists  of  the  following  parts,  as 
shown in Fig. 1. 

1)  Resources  representation  mechanism.  Element 
Fuzzy  Cognitive  Map  (E-FCM)  [19]  is  used  to  represent 
multimedia  resources  with  social  tags  since  it  does  not 
only  reserve  resources‘  keywords  but  also  the  relations 
among them. 

2)  Resources  storage  mechanism.  Database/XML  is 
used to store E-FCM since it is easy to define the mark-up 
elements. 

3)  SLN  generation  mechanism.  Based  on  E-FCM  and 
the  association  rules,  ALN  can  be  generated  by  machine 
automatically.  

4)  Application  mechanism.  SLN  can  be  used  for  Web 
intelligence  activities,  Web  knowledge  discovery  and 
publishing,  etc.  For  example,  when  a  user  browses  mul-
timedia,  other  resources  with  semantic  links  to  it  can  be 
recommended to the user. 

The  three  important  definitions  are  defined  firstly  in 
this  paper  including  the  social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia 
resource and the semantic relatedness between two  mul-
timedia resources. 

Definition  1:  Social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia  resource. 
The  social  tags  (denoted  by  t)  set  of  a  multimedia  re-
source f (denoted by s(f)) is a set of tags provided by users. 

                    (1) 

Definition  2:  Semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The 
) 

semantic  relatedness  between  tags  (denoted  by 

is the expected correlation of a pair of tags 

 and 

. 

Definition  3:  Semantic  relatedness  between  two  mul-
timedia  resources.  The  semantic  relatedness  between 
multimedia  resources  (denoted  by
)  is  the  ex-

pected  correlation  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources 

and 

. 

The range of 

 is from 0 to 1. A high value indi-

cates that semantic relatedness between tags is more like-
ly to be confidential.  

3.3  The Basic Heuristics 

Based  on  common  sense  and  our  observations  on  real 
data, five heuristics that serve as the base of the proposed 
computation model are given as follow. 

Heuristic 1. Usually each tag of a multimedia resource 

appears only one time. 

Different  from  writing  sentences,  users  usually  anno-
tate a multimedia resource with different tags. For exam-
ple,  the  possibility  of  using  tags  ―apple  apple  apple‖  for 
an image is very low. Therefore, in this paper, we do not 
employ any weighting scheme for tags such as tf-idf [26]. 
Heuristic 2. The order of the tags may reflect the corre-

lation against the annotated multimedia resource. 

Different tag reflects the different aspect of a multime-
dia resource. According to Heuristic 1, the weight of a tag 
against  the  image  cannot  be  obtained.  Fortunately,  the 
order  of  the  tags  can  be  get  since  user  may  provide  tags

one by one.  

Heuristic  3.  The  number  of  tags  of  a  multimedia  re-

source may not relevant to the annotation correctness. 

Different users may give different tags about the same 
multimedia  resource.  For  example,  users  may  give  tags 
such as ―apple iPhone‖ or ―iPhone4 mobile phone‖ for  a 
same image about iPhone. It is hardly to say which tag is 
better  for  annotation  though  the  latter  annotation  has 
three tags. 

Heuristic  4.  Usually  some  tags  may  be  redundant  for 

annotating a multimedia resource. 

Of  course,  users  may  give  similar  tags  for  a  multime-
dia  resource.  For  example,  the  tags  ―apple  iPhone‖  may 
be  redundant  since  iPhone  is  very  semantic  similar  to 
apple.  

Heuristic 5. Usually some tags may be noisy for anno-

tating a multimedia resource. 

Users  may  give  inappropriate  or  even  false  tags  for  a 
multimedia resource. For example, the tags  ―iPhone‖ are 
false for an image about the iPod. 

4  GENERATING THE SEMANTIC LINK  

In this section, the computation model for generating the 
semantic link between multimedia resources is proposed. 
Based on the above five heuristics, the social tags provid-
ed by users are used in our computation model. Overall, 
the  proposed  computation  model  is  divided  into  three 
steps. 

(1) Tag relatedness computation. In this step, based on 
heuristic  1,  all  of  the  tag  pairs  between  two  multimedia 
resources are computed. 

(2) Semantic  relatedness  integration.  In  this  step, 
based on heuristics 3-5, the semantic relatedness between 
multimedia resources is computed. 

(3) Tag order revision. In this step, based on heuristic 2, 

the multimedia resources relatedness on step 2 is revised. 
Table 1 shows the variables and parameters used in the 
following discussion. Fig. 2 illustrates an overview of the 
proposed computation model. 

4.1  Tag Relatedness Computation 

According to definition 1, a multimedia resource can be 
represented as a set of tags provided by users. As for the 
semantic  relatedness  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources, 
we can measure the semantic relatedness between tags of 
these  multimedia  resources.  For  example,  two  multime-
dia resources with tags ―apple iPhone‖ and ―iPod Nano‖, 
we  can  measure  the  semantic  relatedness  between  these 
tags. Since the number of each tag is usually one accord-
ing  to  heuristic  1,  the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags 
can be computed without considering their weight.  

Many  different  methods  of  semantic  relatedness 
measures  between  concepts  have  been  proposed,  which 
can  be  divided  into  two  aspects  [27]:  taxonomy-based 
methods  and  web-based  methods.  Taxonomy-based 
methods  use  information  theory  and  hierarchical  taxon-
omy, such as WordNet, to measure semantic  relatedness. 
On the contrary, web-based methods use the web as a live 
and active corpus instead of hierarchical taxonomy.  

In  the  proposed  computation  model,  each  tag  can  be 
seen  as  a  concept  with  explicit  meaning.  Thus,  we  use 
some  equations  based  on  co-occurrence  of  two  concepts 
to  measure  their  semantic  relatedness.  The  core  idea  is 
that ‗you shall know a word by the company it keeps‘ [28]. 
In this section, four popular co-occurrence measures (i.e., 
Jaccard,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI  [29])  are  proposed  to 
measure semantic relatedness between tags. 

Besides  co-occurrence  measures,  the  page  counts  of 
each tag from search engine are used.  Page counts mean 
the number of web pages containing the query q. For ex-
ample,  the  page  counts  of  the  query  ‗Obama‘  in  Google4 
are 1,210,000,0005. Moreover, page counts for the query ‗q 
AND p‘ can be considered as a measure of co-occurrence 
of  queries  q  and  p.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we 
use  the  notation 
 to  denote  the  page  counts  of  the 
tag p in Google. However, the respective page counts for

the tag pair p and q are not enough for measuring seman-
 
tic relatedness. The page counts for the query ‗p AND q‘ 
 
should  be  considered.  For  example,  when  we  query 
 
‗Obama‘  and  ‗United  States‘  in  Google,  we  can  find 
 
485,000,000  Web  pages,  that  is, 
 
=485,000,000.  The  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card, Overlap, Dice, and PMI) between two tags p and q 
are as follows:

According to probability and information theory, the mu-
tual information (MI) of two random variables is a quanti-
ty that measures the mutual dependence of the two vari-
ables. Pointwise mutual information (PMI) is a variant of 
MI (Equation (5)):

where N is the number of Web pages in the search engine, 
which  is  set  to 
 according  to  the  number  of  in-
dexed pages reported by Google. 

Through the equations 2-5, we can compute the tag re-

latedness as follows:

sources

                           (6) 

                           (7) 

next section, we will give the detailed analysis for choos-
ing the best measures from equations 2-5.  

Overall,  the  page  counts  of  each  tag  should  be  issued. 
Then the co-occurrence based measure is used to compute 
the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The  reasons  for 
using page counts based measures are as follow. 

(1)  Appropriate  computation  complexity.  Since  the 
relatedness  between  each  tag  pair  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources should be computed, the proposed method must 
be  with  low  complexity.  Recently,  web  search  engines 
such  as  Google  provide  API  for  users  to  index  the  page 
counts  of  each  query.  The  web  search  engine  gives  an 
appropriate interface for the proposed computation mod-
el. 

(2)  Explicit  semantics.  The  tag  given  by  users  may 
not be a correct concept in taxonomy. For example, users 
may  give  a  tag  ―Bling  Bling‖  for  a  multimedia  resource 
about  a  lovely  girl.  The  word  ―Bling‖  cannot  be  indexed

4.2  Semantic Relatedness Integration 

In  section  4.1,  we  compute  the  tag  pair  relatedness  of 
two  multimedia  resources.  Obviously,  the  tag  pair  relat-
edness  of  two  multimedia  resources 
 can  be 
treated as a bipartite graph, which is denoted as  

 and 

Figure 4. The selected images of group1 from Flickr 

 

is  highest.  Fig.  3  shows  a  graphical  representation  of  the 
semantic  relatedness  integration,  where  the  bold  lines 
constitute the matching M. 

Based  on  the  expressing  of  the  assignment  in  bipartite 

graphs, we have 

    (11) 

 (12) 

Based  on  the  equation  11,  we  change  the  semantic  re-
latedness integration of all tag pairs to the  assignment in 
bipartite graph problem. We want to assign a best match-
ing of the bipartite graph G.  

A matching is defined as 

so that no two edges in 
M share a common end vertex. An assignment in a bipar-
tite graph is a matching M so that each node of the graph 
has an incident edge in M. Suppose that the set of vertices 
are partitioned in two sets 
and , and that the edges of 
the graph have an associated weight given by a  function

.  The  function  maxRel: 

returns  the  maximum  weighted  assignment,  i.e.,  an  as-
signment  so  that  the average  of  the  weights  of  the edges 

Using  the  assignment  in  bipartite  graphs  problem  to 
our context, the variables 
and represent the two mul-
timedia  resources  to  compute  the  semantic  relatedness. 
For example, that 

and are composed of the tags 

and

. 

means that the number of tags in 

is lower than that of 

. According to heuristic 3, 

we  divide  the  result  of  the  maximization  by  the  lower 
cardinality  of 
.  In  this  way,  the  influence  of 

or

the  number  of  tags  is  reduced,  and  the  semantic  related-
ness of two multimedia resources is symmetric.

Schema  1.  Tag  relatedness  declining.  This  schema 
means  that  the  identical  tag  pairs  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources
should be pruned in maxRel function. In 
other  words,  the  semantic  relatedness  of  the  same  tag  of 
two multimedia resources is set as 0. 

 and 

We add a decline factor to the maxRel function, and the 

detailed steps are: 

(1)  According  to  the  maxRel  function  in  section  4.2, 
the best matching tag pairs are selected, which is denoted 
as: 

 (13) 

Of course, the selected tag pairs are the best matching of 
the  bipartite  graph  between  multimedia  resources 
and

; 
(2)  Computing  the  position  information  of  each  tag, 

which is denoted as 

 

               (14); 

(3)  Add  the  position  information  of  each  tag  to  the 

equation 13, which can be seen as a decline factor: 

    (15) 

(4)  Of  course,  similar  to  maxRel  function,  equation 

should divide the result of the maximization by 

        (16) 

Besides the cardinality of two tags set 

and

, 

the  maxRel  function  is  affected  by  the  relatedness  be-
tween  each  pair  of  tags.  According  to  heuristics  4  and  5, 
the  redundancy  and  noise  should  be  avoided.  In  maxRel 
function,  the  one-to-one  map  is  applied  to  the  tags 

and

.  Thus,  the  proposed  maxRel  function  varies 

with respect to the nature of two multimedia resources.  

Adopting  the  proposed  maxRel  function,  we  are  sure 
to  find  the  global  maximum  relatedness  that  can  be  ob-
tained pairing the elements in the two tags sets. Alterna-
tive  methods  are  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum 
since  they  scroll  the  elements  in  the  first  set  and,  after 
calculating  the  relatedness  with  all  the  elements  in  the 
second  set,  they  select  the  one  with  the  maximum  relat-
edness. Since every element in one set must be connected, 
at most, at one element in the other set, such a procedure 
is  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum  since  it  depends 
on  the  order  in  which  the  comparisons  occur.  For  exam-
ple, considering the example in Fig. 3, t1 will be paired to 
q1  (weight=1.0).  But,  when  analyzing  t3  the  maximum 
weight is with q2 (weight=0.9). This means that t2 can no 
more  be  paired  to  q2  even  if  the  weight  is  maximum, 
since  this  is  already  matched  to  t3.  As  a  consequence,  t2 
will  be  paired  to  q3  and  the  average  of  the  selected 
weights  will  be  (1.0+0.3+0.9)/3=0.73  which  is  considera-
bly  lower  than  using  maxRel  where  the  sum  of  the 
weights was (1.0+0.8+0.7)/3=0.83. 

Overall, the cardinality of two tag sets is used to follow 
heuristic  3.  The  one-to-one  map  of  tags  pair  is  used  to 
follow heuristics 4 and 5. The maxRel function is used to 
match a best semantic relatedness integration of two mul-
timedia resources. 

4.3  Tag Order Revision 

According  to  heuristic  2,  the  order  of  tags  should  be 
considered to  compute the  semantic relatedness between 
two multimedia resources. Intuitively, the tags appearing 
in the first position may be more important than the latter 
tags.  Some  researches  [30]  suggest  that  people  used  to 
select  popular  items  as  their  tags.  Meanwhile,  the  top 
popular tags are indeed the ―meaningful‖ ones.  

In this section, the maxRel function proposed in section 
4.2 is revised considering the order of tags. For example, 
the  relatedness  of  tag  pair  with  high  position  should  be

Semantic Link Network based Model for 

Organizing Multimedia Big Data

Member, IEEE，Lan Chen, and Xiangfeng Luo, Member, IEEE 

Abstract—Recent research shows that multimedia resources “in the wild” are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In 
this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network model  is  used for  organizing multimedia  resources.  A  whole  model for  generating  the 
association relation between multimedia resources using Semantic Link Network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the Semantic Link 
Network  and  multimedia  resources  provides  a  new  prospect  for  organizing  them  with  their  semantics.  The  tags  and  the 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to  measure  their  semantic  association.  The  hierarchical  semantic  of 
multimedia resources are defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts 
are  different  in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic  Link  Network  model  are  implemented  to  measure 
association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two 
evaluation  methods  including  clustering  and  retrieval  are  performed,  which  shows  the  proposed  method  can  measure  the 
semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.

1  INTRODUCTION

R 

ECENTLY, Big data is an emerging paradigm applied 
to  datasets  whose  size  is  beyond  the  ability  of  com-
monly  used  software  tools  to  capture,  manage,  and  pro-
cess the data within a tolerable elapsed time [10]. Various 
technologies are being discussed to support the handling 
of  big  data  such  as  massively  parallel  processing  data-
bases [11], scalable storage systems [12, 33], cloud compu-
ting platforms [13, 34], and MapReduce [14, 35].   

Understanding  the  semantics  of  multimedia  has  been 
an  important  component  in  many  multimedia  based  ap-
plications. Manual annotation and tagging has been con-
sidered as a reliable source of multimedia semantics. Un-
fortunately,  manual  annotation  is  time-consuming  and 
expensive  when  dealing  with  huge  scale  of  multimedia 
data. Advances in Semantic Web [15] have made ontology 
another  useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  seman-
tics. Ontology builds a formal and explicit representation 
of  semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  rela-
tionships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive 
implicit  knowledge.  However,  the  semantic  gap  [16]  be-
tween  semantics  and  video  visual  appearance  is  still  a 
challenge  towards  automated  ontology-driven  video  an-
notation. With the rapid growth of video resources on the 
world-wide-web,  for  example,  on  YouTube 1  alone,  35 
hours  of  video  are  unloaded  every  minute  [2],  and  over 
700 billion videos were watched in 2010.  Vast amount of 
videos  with  no  metadata  have  emerged.  Thus  automati-
cally understanding raw multimedia solely based on their

visual  appearance  becomes  an  important  yet  challenging 
problem. Multimedia resources ―in the wild‖ are growing 
at  a  staggering  rate  [1,  2].  The  rapid  increase  number  of 
multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent  need  to  de-
velop intelligent methods to represent and annotate them. 
Typical  applications  in  which  representing  and  annotat-
ing  video  events  include  criminal  investigation  systems 
[3],  video  surveillance  [4],  intrusion  detection  system  [5], 
video  resources  browsing  and  indexing  system  [6],  sport 
events  detection  [7],  internet  of  things  [8,  9],  and  many 
others.  These  urgent  needs  have  posed  challenges  for 
multimedia  resources  management,  and  have  attracted 
the  research  of  the  multimedia  analysis  and  understand-
ing. Overall, the goal is to enable users to search the relat-
ed  resources  from  the  huge  number  of  multimedia  re-
sources.  

With  the  explosion  of  community  contributed  multi-
media content available online, many social media reposi-
tories (e.g. Flickr2, YouTube, and Zooomr3) allow users to 
upload media data and annotate content with descriptive 
keywords which are called social tags. Flickr provides an 
open  platform  for  users  to  publish  their  personal  images 
freely. The principal purpose of tagging is to make imag-
es  better  accessible  to  the  public.  The  success  of  Flickr 
proves that users are willing to participate in this seman-
tic context through manual annotations [17]. Flickr uses a 
promising  approach  for  manual  metadata  generation 
named  ―social  tagging‖,  which  requires  all  the  users  in 
the  social  network  label  the  multimedia  resources  with 
their own keywords and share with others. The character-
istics of social tags are as follows.

(1)  Ontology  free.  The  ontology  based  labeling  de-
fines  ontology  and  then  let  users  label  the  multimedia 
resources  using  the  semantic  markups  in  the  ontology. 
Social tagging requires all the users in the social network 
label the  multimedia resources with their  own keywords 
and share with others. Different from ontology based an-
notation.  There  is  no  pre-defined  ontology  or  taxonomy 
in  social  tagging.  Thus  the  tagging  task  is  more  conven-
ient for users.  

(2)  User  oriented.  The  users  can  annotate  images 
with their favorite tags. The tags of multimedia resources 
are  determined  by  users‘  cognitive  ability.  To  the  multi-
media resources, users may give different tags. Each mul-
timedia  resource  may  be  with  one  tag  at  least,  and  each 
tag may appear in many different multimedia resources. 

(3) 

Semantic  loss.  Irrelevant  social  tags  frequently 
appear,  and  users  typically  will  not  tag  all  semantic  ob-
jects in the image, which is called semantic loss. Polysemy, 
synonyms,  and  ambiguity  are  some  drawbacks  of  social 
tagging. 

In this paper, the Semantic Link Network (SLN) [18, 19, 
20]  model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources 
with  social  tags.  Semantic  Link  Network  is  designed  to 
establish  associated  relations  among  various  resources 
(e.g.,  Web  pages  or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming 
at extending the loosely connected network of no seman-
tics  (e.g.,  the  Web)  to  an  association-rich  network.  Since 
the theory of cognitive science considers that the associat-
ed  relations  can  make  one  resource  more  comprehensive 
to users [21], the motivation of SLN is to organize the as-
sociated  resources  loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  ef-
fectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as 
browsing,  knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness 
between  tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in 
the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  The  major  contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized as follow.  

(1) A  whole  model  for  generating  the  association  rela-
tion  between  multimedia  resources  using  Semantic  Link 
Network  model  is  proposed.  The  definitions,  modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used 
in the proposed method. The integration between the Se-
mantic Link Network and multimedia resources provides 
a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. 
(2) The  tags  and  the  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia 
resources are used to measure their semantic association.  
The  hierarchical  semantic  of  multimedia  resources  are 
defined  by  their  annotated  tags  and  surrounding  texts. 
The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different 
in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic 
Link Network model are implemented to measure associ-
ation relations. 

(3) A real data set including 100 thousand images with 
social  tags  from  Flickr  is  used  in  our  experiments.  Two 
evaluation methods including clustering and retrieval are 
performed, which shows the proposed method can meas-
ure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accu-
rately and robustly. 

(4) The  relatedness  measures  between  concepts  are  ex-

tended  to  the  level  of  multimedia.  Since  the  association 
relation  is  the  basic  mechanism  of  brain.  The  proposed 
Semantic Link Network based model can help the multi-
media  related  applications  such  as  searching  and  recom-
mendation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
gives  the  related  work  of  social  tags  and  semantic  link 
network. The problem definition is introduced in Section 
3.  Section  4  proposes  the  method  for  measuring  associa-
tion of multimedia. Experiments are presented in Section 
5. Conclusions are made in the last section. 

2  RELATED WORK 

Advances  in  Semantic  Web  have  made  ontology  another 
useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  semantics.  The 
ontology  builds  a  formal  and  explicit  representation  of 
semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  relation-
ships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive im-
plicit  knowledge.  In  this  section,  the  related  work  of  the 
proposed  model  is  given.  The  Semantic  Web  [15]  is  an 
evolving development of the World Wide Web, in which 
the meanings of information on the web is defined; there-
fore,  it  is  possible  for  machines  to  process  it.  The  basic 
idea  of  Semantic  Web  is  to  use  ontological  concepts  and 
vocabularies to accurately describe contents in a machine 
readable  way.  These  concepts  and  vocabularies  can  then 
be shared and retrieved on the web. In the Semantic Web, 
each fragment of the description is a triple, based on De-
scription  Logic.  Thus,  the  implicit  connections  and  se-
mantics within the description fragments can be reasoned 
using  Description  Logic  theory  and  ontological  defini-
tions. Earlier research work on the Semantic Web focused 
on  defining  domain  specific  ontologies  and  reasoning 
technologies.  Therefore,  data  are  only  meaningful  in  cer-
tain  domains  and  are  not  connected  to  each  other  from 
the World Wide Web point of view, which certainly limits 
the  contributions  of  Semantic  Web  for  sharing  and  re-
trieving contents within a distributed environment. 

The  Semantic  Link  Network  (SLN)  was  proposed  as  a 
semantic  data  model  for  organizing  various  Web  re-
sources  by  extending  the  Web‘s  hyperlink  to  a  semantic 
link.  SLN  is  a  directed  network  consisting  of  semantic 
nodes and semantic links. A semantic node can be a con-
cept, an instance of concept, a schema of data set, a URL, 
any  form  of  resources,  or  even  an  SLN.  A  semantic  link 
reflects  a  kind  of  relational  knowledge  represented  as  a 
pointer  with  a  tag  describing  such  semantic  relations  as 
cause  Effect,  implication,  subtype,  similar,  instance,  se-
quence,  reference,  and  equal.  The  semantics  of  tags  are 
usually common sense and can be regulated by its catego-
ry,  relevant  reasoning  rules,  and  use  cases.  A  set  of  gen-
eral  semantic  relation  reasoning  rules  was  suggested  in 
[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-
verse  relations  are  knowledge  for  supporting  semantic 
relation reasoning. SLN is a self-organized network since 
any node can link to any other node via a semantic link.

3.2 The Basic Definitions 

SLN  has  been  used  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  query 
routing  in  P2P  network  [24],  and  it  has  been  adopted  as 
one of the major mechanisms of organizing resources for 
the  Knowledge  Grid.  Pons  has  successfully  applied  the 
SLN  to  object  prefetching  and  achieved  a  better  result 
than other approaches [25]. 

3  THE SEMANTIC LINK NETWORK BASED MODEL  

The  tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources 
are  used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  related-
ness between tags and  surrounding texts are implement-
ed  in  the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  In  this  section, 
the  details  of  the  proposed  model  are  given.  The  basic 
definitions, representations, heuristics are introduced. 

3.1  The Basic Mechanisms of the Proposed Model 
SLN can be formalized into a loosely coupled semantic 
model for managing various resources. As a data model, 
the  proposed  model  consists  of  the  following  parts,  as 
shown in Fig. 1. 

1)  Resources  representation  mechanism.  Element 
Fuzzy  Cognitive  Map  (E-FCM)  [19]  is  used  to  represent 
multimedia  resources  with  social  tags  since  it  does  not 
only  reserve  resources‘  keywords  but  also  the  relations 
among them. 

2)  Resources  storage  mechanism.  Database/XML  is 
used to store E-FCM since it is easy to define the mark-up 
elements. 

3)  SLN  generation  mechanism.  Based  on  E-FCM  and 
the  association  rules,  ALN  can  be  generated  by  machine 
automatically.  

4)  Application  mechanism.  SLN  can  be  used  for  Web 
intelligence  activities,  Web  knowledge  discovery  and 
publishing,  etc.  For  example,  when  a  user  browses  mul-
timedia,  other  resources  with  semantic  links  to  it  can  be 
recommended to the user. 

The  three  important  definitions  are  defined  firstly  in 
this  paper  including  the  social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia 
resource and the semantic relatedness between two  mul-
timedia resources. 

Definition  1:  Social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia  resource. 
The  social  tags  (denoted  by  t)  set  of  a  multimedia  re-
source f (denoted by s(f)) is a set of tags provided by users. 

                    (1) 

Definition  2:  Semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The 
) 

semantic  relatedness  between  tags  (denoted  by

3.3  The Basic Heuristics 

Based  on  common  sense  and  our  observations  on  real 
data, five heuristics that serve as the base of the proposed 
computation model are given as follow. 

Heuristic 1. Usually each tag of a multimedia resource 

appears only one time. 

Different  from  writing  sentences,  users  usually  anno-
tate a multimedia resource with different tags. For exam-
ple,  the  possibility  of  using  tags  ―apple  apple  apple‖  for 
an image is very low. Therefore, in this paper, we do not 
employ any weighting scheme for tags such as tf-idf [26]. 
Heuristic 2. The order of the tags may reflect the corre-

lation against the annotated multimedia resource. 

Different tag reflects the different aspect of a multime-
dia resource. According to Heuristic 1, the weight of a tag 
against  the  image  cannot  be  obtained.  Fortunately,  the 
order  of  the  tags  can  be  get  since  user  may  provide  tags

Heuristic  3.  The  number  of  tags  of  a  multimedia  re-

source may not relevant to the annotation correctness. 

Different users may give different tags about the same 
multimedia  resource.  For  example,  users  may  give  tags 
such as ―apple iPhone‖ or ―iPhone4 mobile phone‖ for  a 
same image about iPhone. It is hardly to say which tag is 
better  for  annotation  though  the  latter  annotation  has 
three tags. 

Heuristic  4.  Usually  some  tags  may  be  redundant  for 

annotating a multimedia resource. 

Of  course,  users  may  give  similar  tags  for  a  multime-
dia  resource.  For  example,  the  tags  ―apple  iPhone‖  may 
be  redundant  since  iPhone  is  very  semantic  similar  to 
apple.  

Heuristic 5. Usually some tags may be noisy for anno-

tating a multimedia resource. 

Users  may  give  inappropriate  or  even  false  tags  for  a 
multimedia resource. For example, the tags  ―iPhone‖ are 
false for an image about the iPod. 

4  GENERATING THE SEMANTIC LINK  

In this section, the computation model for generating the 
semantic link between multimedia resources is proposed. 
Based on the above five heuristics, the social tags provid-
ed by users are used in our computation model. Overall, 
the  proposed  computation  model  is  divided  into  three 
steps. 

(1) Tag relatedness computation. In this step, based on 
heuristic  1,  all  of  the  tag  pairs  between  two  multimedia 
resources are computed. 

(2) Semantic  relatedness  integration.  In  this  step, 
based on heuristics 3-5, the semantic relatedness between 
multimedia resources is computed. 

(3) Tag order revision. In this step, based on heuristic 2, 

the multimedia resources relatedness on step 2 is revised. 
Table 1 shows the variables and parameters used in the 
following discussion. Fig. 2 illustrates an overview of the 
proposed computation model. 

4.1  Tag Relatedness Computation 

According to definition 1, a multimedia resource can be 
represented as a set of tags provided by users. As for the 
semantic  relatedness  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources, 
we can measure the semantic relatedness between tags of 
these  multimedia  resources.  For  example,  two  multime-
dia resources with tags ―apple iPhone‖ and ―iPod Nano‖, 
we  can  measure  the  semantic  relatedness  between  these 
tags. Since the number of each tag is usually one accord-
ing  to  heuristic  1,  the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags 
can be computed without considering their weight.  

Many  different  methods  of  semantic  relatedness 
measures  between  concepts  have  been  proposed,  which 
can  be  divided  into  two  aspects  [27]:  taxonomy-based 
methods  and  web-based  methods.  Taxonomy-based 
methods  use  information  theory  and  hierarchical  taxon-
omy, such as WordNet, to measure semantic  relatedness. 
On the contrary, web-based methods use the web as a live 
and active corpus instead of hierarchical taxonomy.  

In  the  proposed  computation  model,  each  tag  can  be 
seen  as  a  concept  with  explicit  meaning.  Thus,  we  use 
some  equations  based  on  co-occurrence  of  two  concepts 
to  measure  their  semantic  relatedness.  The  core  idea  is 
that ‗you shall know a word by the company it keeps‘ [28]. 
In this section, four popular co-occurrence measures (i.e., 
Jaccard,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI  [29])  are  proposed  to 
measure semantic relatedness between tags. 

Besides  co-occurrence  measures,  the  page  counts  of 
each tag from search engine are used.  Page counts mean 
the number of web pages containing the query q. For ex-
ample,  the  page  counts  of  the  query  ‗Obama‘  in  Google4 
are 1,210,000,0005. Moreover, page counts for the query ‗q 
AND p‘ can be considered as a measure of co-occurrence 
of  queries  q  and  p.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we 
use  the  notation 
 to  denote  the  page  counts  of  the 
tag p in Google. However, the respective page counts for

the tag pair p and q are not enough for measuring seman-
 
tic relatedness. The page counts for the query ‗p AND q‘ 
 
should  be  considered.  For  example,  when  we  query 
 
‗Obama‘  and  ‗United  States‘  in  Google,  we  can  find 
 
485,000,000  Web  pages,  that  is, 
 
=485,000,000.  The  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card, Overlap, Dice, and PMI) between two tags p and q 
are as follows:

equation can be:

According to probability and information theory, the mu-
tual information (MI) of two random variables is a quanti-
ty that measures the mutual dependence of the two vari-
ables. Pointwise mutual information (PMI) is a variant of 
MI (Equation (5)):

where N is the number of Web pages in the search engine, 
which  is  set  to

dexed pages reported by Google. 

Through the equations 2-5, we can compute the tag re-

latedness as follows:

sources

                           (6) 

                           (7) 

next section, we will give the detailed analysis for choos-
ing the best measures from equations 2-5.  

Overall,  the  page  counts  of  each  tag  should  be  issued. 
Then the co-occurrence based measure is used to compute 
the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The  reasons  for 
using page counts based measures are as follow. 

(1)  Appropriate  computation  complexity.  Since  the 
relatedness  between  each  tag  pair  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources should be computed, the proposed method must 
be  with  low  complexity.  Recently,  web  search  engines 
such  as  Google  provide  API  for  users  to  index  the  page 
counts  of  each  query.  The  web  search  engine  gives  an 
appropriate interface for the proposed computation mod-
el. 

(2)  Explicit  semantics.  The  tag  given  by  users  may 
not be a correct concept in taxonomy. For example, users 
may  give  a  tag  ―Bling  Bling‖  for  a  multimedia  resource 
about  a  lovely  girl.  The  word  ―Bling‖  cannot  be  indexed

4.2  Semantic Relatedness Integration 

In  section  4.1,  we  compute  the  tag  pair  relatedness  of 
two  multimedia  resources.  Obviously,  the  tag  pair  relat-
edness  of  two  multimedia  resources 
 can  be 
treated as a bipartite graph, which is denoted as  

 and

is  highest.  Fig.  3  shows  a  graphical  representation  of  the 
semantic  relatedness  integration,  where  the  bold  lines 
constitute the matching M. 

Based  on  the  expressing  of  the  assignment  in  bipartite 

graphs, we have 

    (11) 

 (12) 

Based  on  the  equation  11,  we  change  the  semantic  re-
latedness integration of all tag pairs to the  assignment in 
bipartite graph problem. We want to assign a best match-
ing of the bipartite graph G.  

A matching is defined as 

so that no two edges in 
M share a common end vertex. An assignment in a bipar-
tite graph is a matching M so that each node of the graph 
has an incident edge in M. Suppose that the set of vertices 
are partitioned in two sets 
and , and that the edges of 
the graph have an associated weight given by a  function

.  The  function  maxRel: 

returns  the  maximum  weighted  assignment,  i.e.,  an  as-
signment  so  that  the average  of  the  weights  of  the edges 

Using  the  assignment  in  bipartite  graphs  problem  to 
our context, the variables 
and represent the two mul-
timedia  resources  to  compute  the  semantic  relatedness. 
For example, that 

and are composed of the tags

. 

means that the number of tags in 

is lower than that of 

. According to heuristic 3, 

we  divide  the  result  of  the  maximization  by  the  lower 
cardinality  of 
.  In  this  way,  the  influence  of 

or

the  number  of  tags  is  reduced,  and  the  semantic  related-
ness of two multimedia resources is symmetric.

Schema  1.  Tag  relatedness  declining.  This  schema 
means  that  the  identical  tag  pairs  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources
should be pruned in maxRel function. In 
other  words,  the  semantic  relatedness  of  the  same  tag  of 
two multimedia resources is set as 0. 

 and 

We add a decline factor to the maxRel function, and the 

detailed steps are: 

(1)  According  to  the  maxRel  function  in  section  4.2, 
the best matching tag pairs are selected, which is denoted 
as: 

 (13) 

Of course, the selected tag pairs are the best matching of 
the  bipartite  graph  between  multimedia  resources 
and

; 
(2)  Computing  the  position  information  of  each  tag, 

which is denoted as 

 

               (14); 

(3)  Add  the  position  information  of  each  tag  to  the 

equation 13, which can be seen as a decline factor: 

    (15) 

(4)  Of  course,  similar  to  maxRel  function,  equation 

should divide the result of the maximization by 

        (16) 

Besides the cardinality of two tags set 

and

, 

the  maxRel  function  is  affected  by  the  relatedness  be-
tween  each  pair  of  tags.  According  to  heuristics  4  and  5, 
the  redundancy  and  noise  should  be  avoided.  In  maxRel 
function,  the  one-to-one  map  is  applied  to  the  tags 

and

.  Thus,  the  proposed  maxRel  function  varies 

with respect to the nature of two multimedia resources.  

Adopting  the  proposed  maxRel  function,  we  are  sure 
to  find  the  global  maximum  relatedness  that  can  be  ob-
tained pairing the elements in the two tags sets. Alterna-
tive  methods  are  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum 
since  they  scroll  the  elements  in  the  first  set  and,  after 
calculating  the  relatedness  with  all  the  elements  in  the 
second  set,  they  select  the  one  with  the  maximum  relat-
edness. Since every element in one set must be connected, 
at most, at one element in the other set, such a procedure 
is  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum  since  it  depends 
on  the  order  in  which  the  comparisons  occur.  For  exam-
ple, considering the example in Fig. 3, t1 will be paired to 
q1  (weight=1.0).  But,  when  analyzing  t3  the  maximum 
weight is with q2 (weight=0.9). This means that t2 can no 
more  be  paired  to  q2  even  if  the  weight  is  maximum, 
since  this  is  already  matched  to  t3.  As  a  consequence,  t2 
will  be  paired  to  q3  and  the  average  of  the  selected 
weights  will  be  (1.0+0.3+0.9)/3=0.73  which  is  considera-
bly  lower  than  using  maxRel  where  the  sum  of  the 
weights was (1.0+0.8+0.7)/3=0.83. 

Overall, the cardinality of two tag sets is used to follow 
heuristic  3.  The  one-to-one  map  of  tags  pair  is  used  to 
follow heuristics 4 and 5. The maxRel function is used to 
match a best semantic relatedness integration of two mul-
timedia resources. 

4.3  Tag Order Revision 

According  to  heuristic  2,  the  order  of  tags  should  be 
considered to  compute the  semantic relatedness between 
two multimedia resources. Intuitively, the tags appearing 
in the first position may be more important than the latter 
tags.  Some  researches  [30]  suggest  that  people  used  to 
select  popular  items  as  their  tags.  Meanwhile,  the  top 
popular tags are indeed the ―meaningful‖ ones.  

In this section, the maxRel function proposed in section 
4.2 is revised considering the order of tags. For example, 
the  relatedness  of  tag  pair  with  high  position  should  be

We  also  consider  the  example  in  Fig.  3.  According  to

Besides  adding  decline  factor  to  the  maxRel  function, 

we also add a constrain schema: identical tag pruning.  

Schema  2.  Identical  tag  pruning.  This  schema  means 
 
that the identical tag pairs of two multimedia resources
and 
should  be  pruned  in  maxRel  function.  In  other 
words,  the  semantic  relatedness  of  the  same  tag  of  two 
multimedia resources is set as 0. 

The  above  schema  is  used  to  ensure  the  relatedness 
measures  of  two  multimedia  resources.  If  we  do  not 
prune the identical tag pairs of two multimedia resources, 
the proposed method will be transformed to the similari-
ty  measures.  For  example,  the  cosine  similarity  between 
two  tags  is  to  find  the  number  of  identical  elements  of 
two  vectors.  The  overall  algorithm  of  the  proposed  com-
putation mode is presented in algorithm 1. 

5  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  results  of  using  the  pro-
posed method for relatedness measurement. In section 5.1, 
we introduce the data set for the evaluation. In section 5.2, 
we  determine  to  use  the  co-occurrence  function  for  tag 
relatedness  measures.  In  section  5.3  and  5.4,  clustering 
and retrieval are used for evaluate the proposed method. 
In  section  5.5,  some  discussions  about  the  experimental 
results are given.  

5.1  The Data Sets 

We choose Flickr groups as the resources for building data 
sets. Users on online photo sharing sites like Flickr have or-
ganized  many  millions  of  photos  into  hundreds  of  thou-
sands of semantically themed groups. These groups expose 
implicit  choices  that  users  make  about  which  images  are 
similar. Flickr group membership is usually less noisy than 
Flickr tags because images are screened by group members. 
We  download  100  thousand  images  with  tags  from  100 
groups. The tags  of these images are extracted.  Each  group 
means a concept. Thus, if the proposed method can do well 
in these groups, we may say that it can measure the semantic 
relatedness  between  Flickr  images  accurately  and  robustly. 
Table  2  gives  the  detailed  information  of  some  selected 

Figure 9. The top five searching results from Flickr 

 

group  of  the  data  set.  Some  selected  images  from  some 
groups are shown in Fig. 4. Table 3 gives some selected tags. 

5.2  Relatedness Function Selection 

In  the  section  4.1,  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI)  are  given  for  relatedness 
measures  between  tags.  In  [31],  Rubenstein  and  Goode-
nough  proposed  a  dataset  containing  28  word-pairs  rating 
by a group of 51 human subjects, which is a reliable bench-
mark for evaluating semantic similarity measures. The high-
er the correlation coefficient against R-G ratings is, the more 
accurate the methods for measuring semantic similarity be-
tween  words  are.  Fig.  5  gives  the  correlation  coefficient  of 
four functions against R-G test set. From Fig. 5, we can say 
that PMI performs best on relatedness measures for its high-
est correlation coefficient. Thus, in the latter experiments, we 
select PMI as the relatedness measures between tags. 

5.3  Evaluation on Image Clustering 

In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  correctness  of  using  tag 
order. In section 4.3, we add the position information of each 
tag to the semantic relatedness measures. The tags with high 
position are treated as the major element for sematic related-
ness  measures.  We  evaluate  the  using  of  tag  order  by  the 
clustering  task.  We  employ  the  proposed  semantic  related-
ness of images into K-means [32] clustering model. Since the 
K-means  model  depends  on  the  initial  points,  we  random

Semantic Link Network based Model for 

Organizing Multimedia Big Data

Abstract—Recent research shows that multimedia resources “in the wild” are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In 
this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network model  is  used for  organizing multimedia  resources.  A  whole  model for  generating  the 
association relation between multimedia resources using Semantic Link Network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the Semantic Link 
Network  and  multimedia  resources  provides  a  new  prospect  for  organizing  them  with  their  semantics.  The  tags  and  the 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to  measure  their  semantic  association.  The  hierarchical  semantic  of 
multimedia resources are defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts 
are  different  in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic  Link  Network  model  are  implemented  to  measure 
association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two 
evaluation  methods  including  clustering  and  retrieval  are  performed,  which  shows  the  proposed  method  can  measure  the 
semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.

1  INTRODUCTION

R 

ECENTLY, Big data is an emerging paradigm applied 
to  datasets  whose  size  is  beyond  the  ability  of  com-
monly  used  software  tools  to  capture,  manage,  and  pro-
cess the data within a tolerable elapsed time [10]. Various 
technologies are being discussed to support the handling 
of  big  data  such  as  massively  parallel  processing  data-
bases [11], scalable storage systems [12, 33], cloud compu-
ting platforms [13, 34], and MapReduce [14, 35].   

Understanding  the  semantics  of  multimedia  has  been 
an  important  component  in  many  multimedia  based  ap-
plications. Manual annotation and tagging has been con-
sidered as a reliable source of multimedia semantics. Un-
fortunately,  manual  annotation  is  time-consuming  and 
expensive  when  dealing  with  huge  scale  of  multimedia 
data. Advances in Semantic Web [15] have made ontology 
another  useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  seman-
tics. Ontology builds a formal and explicit representation 
of  semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  rela-
tionships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive 
implicit  knowledge.  However,  the  semantic  gap  [16]  be-
tween  semantics  and  video  visual  appearance  is  still  a 
challenge  towards  automated  ontology-driven  video  an-
notation. With the rapid growth of video resources on the 
world-wide-web,  for  example,  on  YouTube 1  alone,  35 
hours  of  video  are  unloaded  every  minute  [2],  and  over 
700 billion videos were watched in 2010.  Vast amount of 
videos  with  no  metadata  have  emerged.  Thus  automati-
cally understanding raw multimedia solely based on their

visual  appearance  becomes  an  important  yet  challenging 
problem. Multimedia resources ―in the wild‖ are growing 
at  a  staggering  rate  [1,  2].  The  rapid  increase  number  of 
multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent  need  to  de-
velop intelligent methods to represent and annotate them. 
Typical  applications  in  which  representing  and  annotat-
ing  video  events  include  criminal  investigation  systems 
[3],  video  surveillance  [4],  intrusion  detection  system  [5], 
video  resources  browsing  and  indexing  system  [6],  sport 
events  detection  [7],  internet  of  things  [8,  9],  and  many 
others.  These  urgent  needs  have  posed  challenges  for 
multimedia  resources  management,  and  have  attracted 
the  research  of  the  multimedia  analysis  and  understand-
ing. Overall, the goal is to enable users to search the relat-
ed  resources  from  the  huge  number  of  multimedia  re-
sources.  

With  the  explosion  of  community  contributed  multi-
media content available online, many social media reposi-
tories (e.g. Flickr2, YouTube, and Zooomr3) allow users to 
upload media data and annotate content with descriptive 
keywords which are called social tags. Flickr provides an 
open  platform  for  users  to  publish  their  personal  images 
freely. The principal purpose of tagging is to make imag-
es  better  accessible  to  the  public.  The  success  of  Flickr 
proves that users are willing to participate in this seman-
tic context through manual annotations [17]. Flickr uses a 
promising  approach  for  manual  metadata  generation 
named  ―social  tagging‖,  which  requires  all  the  users  in 
the  social  network  label  the  multimedia  resources  with 
their own keywords and share with others. The character-
istics of social tags are as follows.

(1)  Ontology  free.  The  ontology  based  labeling  de-
fines  ontology  and  then  let  users  label  the  multimedia 
resources  using  the  semantic  markups  in  the  ontology. 
Social tagging requires all the users in the social network 
label the  multimedia resources with their  own keywords 
and share with others. Different from ontology based an-
notation.  There  is  no  pre-defined  ontology  or  taxonomy 
in  social  tagging.  Thus  the  tagging  task  is  more  conven-
ient for users.  

(2)  User  oriented.  The  users  can  annotate  images 
with their favorite tags. The tags of multimedia resources 
are  determined  by  users‘  cognitive  ability.  To  the  multi-
media resources, users may give different tags. Each mul-
timedia  resource  may  be  with  one  tag  at  least,  and  each 
tag may appear in many different multimedia resources. 

(3) 

Semantic  loss.  Irrelevant  social  tags  frequently 
appear,  and  users  typically  will  not  tag  all  semantic  ob-
jects in the image, which is called semantic loss. Polysemy, 
synonyms,  and  ambiguity  are  some  drawbacks  of  social 
tagging. 

In this paper, the Semantic Link Network (SLN) [18, 19, 
20]  model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources 
with  social  tags.  Semantic  Link  Network  is  designed  to 
establish  associated  relations  among  various  resources 
(e.g.,  Web  pages  or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming 
at extending the loosely connected network of no seman-
tics  (e.g.,  the  Web)  to  an  association-rich  network.  Since 
the theory of cognitive science considers that the associat-
ed  relations  can  make  one  resource  more  comprehensive 
to users [21], the motivation of SLN is to organize the as-
sociated  resources  loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  ef-
fectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as 
browsing,  knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness 
between  tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in 
the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  The  major  contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized as follow.  

(1) A  whole  model  for  generating  the  association  rela-
tion  between  multimedia  resources  using  Semantic  Link 
Network  model  is  proposed.  The  definitions,  modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used 
in the proposed method. The integration between the Se-
mantic Link Network and multimedia resources provides 
a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. 
(2) The  tags  and  the  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia 
resources are used to measure their semantic association.  
The  hierarchical  semantic  of  multimedia  resources  are 
defined  by  their  annotated  tags  and  surrounding  texts. 
The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different 
in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic 
Link Network model are implemented to measure associ-
ation relations. 

(3) A real data set including 100 thousand images with 
social  tags  from  Flickr  is  used  in  our  experiments.  Two 
evaluation methods including clustering and retrieval are 
performed, which shows the proposed method can meas-
ure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accu-
rately and robustly. 

(4) The  relatedness  measures  between  concepts  are  ex-

tended  to  the  level  of  multimedia.  Since  the  association 
relation  is  the  basic  mechanism  of  brain.  The  proposed 
Semantic Link Network based model can help the multi-
media  related  applications  such  as  searching  and  recom-
mendation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
gives  the  related  work  of  social  tags  and  semantic  link 
network. The problem definition is introduced in Section 
3.  Section  4  proposes  the  method  for  measuring  associa-
tion of multimedia. Experiments are presented in Section 
5. Conclusions are made in the last section. 

2  RELATED WORK 

Advances  in  Semantic  Web  have  made  ontology  another 
useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  semantics.  The 
ontology  builds  a  formal  and  explicit  representation  of 
semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  relation-
ships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive im-
plicit  knowledge.  In  this  section,  the  related  work  of  the 
proposed  model  is  given.  The  Semantic  Web  [15]  is  an 
evolving development of the World Wide Web, in which 
the meanings of information on the web is defined; there-
fore,  it  is  possible  for  machines  to  process  it.  The  basic 
idea  of  Semantic  Web  is  to  use  ontological  concepts  and 
vocabularies to accurately describe contents in a machine 
readable  way.  These  concepts  and  vocabularies  can  then 
be shared and retrieved on the web. In the Semantic Web, 
each fragment of the description is a triple, based on De-
scription  Logic.  Thus,  the  implicit  connections  and  se-
mantics within the description fragments can be reasoned 
using  Description  Logic  theory  and  ontological  defini-
tions. Earlier research work on the Semantic Web focused 
on  defining  domain  specific  ontologies  and  reasoning 
technologies.  Therefore,  data  are  only  meaningful  in  cer-
tain  domains  and  are  not  connected  to  each  other  from 
the World Wide Web point of view, which certainly limits 
the  contributions  of  Semantic  Web  for  sharing  and  re-
trieving contents within a distributed environment. 

The  Semantic  Link  Network  (SLN)  was  proposed  as  a 
semantic  data  model  for  organizing  various  Web  re-
sources  by  extending  the  Web‘s  hyperlink  to  a  semantic 
link.  SLN  is  a  directed  network  consisting  of  semantic 
nodes and semantic links. A semantic node can be a con-
cept, an instance of concept, a schema of data set, a URL, 
any  form  of  resources,  or  even  an  SLN.  A  semantic  link 
reflects  a  kind  of  relational  knowledge  represented  as  a 
pointer  with  a  tag  describing  such  semantic  relations  as 
cause  Effect,  implication,  subtype,  similar,  instance,  se-
quence,  reference,  and  equal.  The  semantics  of  tags  are 
usually common sense and can be regulated by its catego-
ry,  relevant  reasoning  rules,  and  use  cases.  A  set  of  gen-
eral  semantic  relation  reasoning  rules  was  suggested  in 
[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-
verse  relations  are  knowledge  for  supporting  semantic 
relation reasoning. SLN is a self-organized network since 
any node can link to any other node via a semantic link.

3.2 The Basic Definitions 

SLN  has  been  used  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  query 
routing  in  P2P  network  [24],  and  it  has  been  adopted  as 
one of the major mechanisms of organizing resources for 
the  Knowledge  Grid.  Pons  has  successfully  applied  the 
SLN  to  object  prefetching  and  achieved  a  better  result 
than other approaches [25]. 

3  THE SEMANTIC LINK NETWORK BASED MODEL  

The  tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources 
are  used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  related-
ness between tags and  surrounding texts are implement-
ed  in  the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  In  this  section, 
the  details  of  the  proposed  model  are  given.  The  basic 
definitions, representations, heuristics are introduced. 

3.1  The Basic Mechanisms of the Proposed Model 
SLN can be formalized into a loosely coupled semantic 
model for managing various resources. As a data model, 
the  proposed  model  consists  of  the  following  parts,  as 
shown in Fig. 1. 

1)  Resources  representation  mechanism.  Element 
Fuzzy  Cognitive  Map  (E-FCM)  [19]  is  used  to  represent 
multimedia  resources  with  social  tags  since  it  does  not 
only  reserve  resources‘  keywords  but  also  the  relations 
among them. 

2)  Resources  storage  mechanism.  Database/XML  is 
used to store E-FCM since it is easy to define the mark-up 
elements. 

3)  SLN  generation  mechanism.  Based  on  E-FCM  and 
the  association  rules,  ALN  can  be  generated  by  machine 
automatically.  

4)  Application  mechanism.  SLN  can  be  used  for  Web 
intelligence  activities,  Web  knowledge  discovery  and 
publishing,  etc.  For  example,  when  a  user  browses  mul-
timedia,  other  resources  with  semantic  links  to  it  can  be 
recommended to the user. 

The  three  important  definitions  are  defined  firstly  in 
this  paper  including  the  social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia 
resource and the semantic relatedness between two  mul-
timedia resources. 

Definition  1:  Social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia  resource. 
The  social  tags  (denoted  by  t)  set  of  a  multimedia  re-
source f (denoted by s(f)) is a set of tags provided by users. 

                    (1) 

Definition  2:  Semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The 
) 

semantic  relatedness  between  tags  (denoted  by 

is the expected correlation of a pair of tags 

 and 

. 

Definition  3:  Semantic  relatedness  between  two  mul-
timedia  resources.  The  semantic  relatedness  between 
multimedia  resources  (denoted  by
)  is  the  ex-

pected  correlation  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources 

and 

. 

The range of 

 is from 0 to 1. A high value indi-

cates that semantic relatedness between tags is more like-
ly to be confidential.  

3.3  The Basic Heuristics 

Based  on  common  sense  and  our  observations  on  real 
data, five heuristics that serve as the base of the proposed 
computation model are given as follow. 

Heuristic 1. Usually each tag of a multimedia resource 

appears only one time. 

Different  from  writing  sentences,  users  usually  anno-
tate a multimedia resource with different tags. For exam-
ple,  the  possibility  of  using  tags  ―apple  apple  apple‖  for 
an image is very low. Therefore, in this paper, we do not 
employ any weighting scheme for tags such as tf-idf [26]. 
Heuristic 2. The order of the tags may reflect the corre-

lation against the annotated multimedia resource. 

Different tag reflects the different aspect of a multime-
dia resource. According to Heuristic 1, the weight of a tag 
against  the  image  cannot  be  obtained.  Fortunately,  the 
order  of  the  tags  can  be  get  since  user  may  provide  tags

one by one.  

Heuristic  3.  The  number  of  tags  of  a  multimedia  re-

source may not relevant to the annotation correctness. 

Different users may give different tags about the same 
multimedia  resource.  For  example,  users  may  give  tags 
such as ―apple iPhone‖ or ―iPhone4 mobile phone‖ for  a 
same image about iPhone. It is hardly to say which tag is 
better  for  annotation  though  the  latter  annotation  has 
three tags. 

Heuristic  4.  Usually  some  tags  may  be  redundant  for 

annotating a multimedia resource. 

Of  course,  users  may  give  similar  tags  for  a  multime-
dia  resource.  For  example,  the  tags  ―apple  iPhone‖  may 
be  redundant  since  iPhone  is  very  semantic  similar  to 
apple.  

Heuristic 5. Usually some tags may be noisy for anno-

tating a multimedia resource. 

Users  may  give  inappropriate  or  even  false  tags  for  a 
multimedia resource. For example, the tags  ―iPhone‖ are 
false for an image about the iPod. 

4  GENERATING THE SEMANTIC LINK  

In this section, the computation model for generating the 
semantic link between multimedia resources is proposed. 
Based on the above five heuristics, the social tags provid-
ed by users are used in our computation model. Overall, 
the  proposed  computation  model  is  divided  into  three 
steps. 

(1) Tag relatedness computation. In this step, based on 
heuristic  1,  all  of  the  tag  pairs  between  two  multimedia 
resources are computed. 

(2) Semantic  relatedness  integration.  In  this  step, 
based on heuristics 3-5, the semantic relatedness between 
multimedia resources is computed. 

(3) Tag order revision. In this step, based on heuristic 2, 

the multimedia resources relatedness on step 2 is revised. 
Table 1 shows the variables and parameters used in the 
following discussion. Fig. 2 illustrates an overview of the 
proposed computation model. 

4.1  Tag Relatedness Computation 

According to definition 1, a multimedia resource can be 
represented as a set of tags provided by users. As for the 
semantic  relatedness  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources, 
we can measure the semantic relatedness between tags of 
these  multimedia  resources.  For  example,  two  multime-
dia resources with tags ―apple iPhone‖ and ―iPod Nano‖, 
we  can  measure  the  semantic  relatedness  between  these 
tags. Since the number of each tag is usually one accord-
ing  to  heuristic  1,  the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags 
can be computed without considering their weight.  

Many  different  methods  of  semantic  relatedness 
measures  between  concepts  have  been  proposed,  which 
can  be  divided  into  two  aspects  [27]:  taxonomy-based 
methods  and  web-based  methods.  Taxonomy-based 
methods  use  information  theory  and  hierarchical  taxon-
omy, such as WordNet, to measure semantic  relatedness. 
On the contrary, web-based methods use the web as a live 
and active corpus instead of hierarchical taxonomy.  

In  the  proposed  computation  model,  each  tag  can  be 
seen  as  a  concept  with  explicit  meaning.  Thus,  we  use 
some  equations  based  on  co-occurrence  of  two  concepts 
to  measure  their  semantic  relatedness.  The  core  idea  is 
that ‗you shall know a word by the company it keeps‘ [28]. 
In this section, four popular co-occurrence measures (i.e., 
Jaccard,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI  [29])  are  proposed  to 
measure semantic relatedness between tags. 

Besides  co-occurrence  measures,  the  page  counts  of 
each tag from search engine are used.  Page counts mean 
the number of web pages containing the query q. For ex-
ample,  the  page  counts  of  the  query  ‗Obama‘  in  Google4 
are 1,210,000,0005. Moreover, page counts for the query ‗q 
AND p‘ can be considered as a measure of co-occurrence 
of  queries  q  and  p.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we 
use  the  notation 
 to  denote  the  page  counts  of  the 
tag p in Google. However, the respective page counts for

the tag pair p and q are not enough for measuring seman-
 
tic relatedness. The page counts for the query ‗p AND q‘ 
 
should  be  considered.  For  example,  when  we  query 
 
‗Obama‘  and  ‗United  States‘  in  Google,  we  can  find 
 
485,000,000  Web  pages,  that  is, 
 
=485,000,000.  The  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card, Overlap, Dice, and PMI) between two tags p and q 
are as follows:

According to probability and information theory, the mu-
tual information (MI) of two random variables is a quanti-
ty that measures the mutual dependence of the two vari-
ables. Pointwise mutual information (PMI) is a variant of 
MI (Equation (5)):

where N is the number of Web pages in the search engine, 
which  is  set  to

dexed pages reported by Google.

latedness as follows:

next section, we will give the detailed analysis for choos-
ing the best measures from equations 2-5.  

Overall,  the  page  counts  of  each  tag  should  be  issued. 
Then the co-occurrence based measure is used to compute 
the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The  reasons  for 
using page counts based measures are as follow. 

(1)  Appropriate  computation  complexity.  Since  the 
relatedness  between  each  tag  pair  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources should be computed, the proposed method must 
be  with  low  complexity.  Recently,  web  search  engines 
such  as  Google  provide  API  for  users  to  index  the  page 
counts  of  each  query.  The  web  search  engine  gives  an 
appropriate interface for the proposed computation mod-
el. 

(2)  Explicit  semantics.  The  tag  given  by  users  may 
not be a correct concept in taxonomy. For example, users 
may  give  a  tag  ―Bling  Bling‖  for  a  multimedia  resource 
about  a  lovely  girl.  The  word  ―Bling‖  cannot  be  indexed

4.2  Semantic Relatedness Integration 

In  section  4.1,  we  compute  the  tag  pair  relatedness  of 
two  multimedia  resources.  Obviously,  the  tag  pair  relat-
edness  of  two  multimedia  resources 
 can  be 
treated as a bipartite graph, which is denoted as  

 and

is  highest.  Fig.  3  shows  a  graphical  representation  of  the 
semantic  relatedness  integration,  where  the  bold  lines 
constitute the matching M. 

Based  on  the  expressing  of  the  assignment  in  bipartite 

graphs, we have 

    (11) 

 (12) 

Based  on  the  equation  11,  we  change  the  semantic  re-
latedness integration of all tag pairs to the  assignment in 
bipartite graph problem. We want to assign a best match-
ing of the bipartite graph G.  

A matching is defined as 

so that no two edges in 
M share a common end vertex. An assignment in a bipar-
tite graph is a matching M so that each node of the graph 
has an incident edge in M. Suppose that the set of vertices 
are partitioned in two sets 
and , and that the edges of 
the graph have an associated weight given by a  function

.  The  function  maxRel: 

returns  the  maximum  weighted  assignment,  i.e.,  an  as-
signment  so  that  the average  of  the  weights  of  the edges 

Using  the  assignment  in  bipartite  graphs  problem  to 
our context, the variables

timedia  resources  to  compute  the  semantic  relatedness. 
For example, that 

and are composed of the tags 

and

. 

means that the number of tags in 

is lower than that of 

. According to heuristic 3, 

we  divide  the  result  of  the  maximization  by  the  lower 
cardinality  of 
.  In  this  way,  the  influence  of 

or

the  number  of  tags  is  reduced,  and  the  semantic  related-
ness of two multimedia resources is symmetric.

enhanced, which is summarized as a constrain schema: 

Schema  1.  Tag  relatedness  declining.  This  schema 
means  that  the  identical  tag  pairs  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources
should be pruned in maxRel function. In 
other  words,  the  semantic  relatedness  of  the  same  tag  of 
two multimedia resources is set as 0. 

 and 

We add a decline factor to the maxRel function, and the 

detailed steps are: 

(1)  According  to  the  maxRel  function  in  section  4.2, 
the best matching tag pairs are selected, which is denoted 
as: 

 (13) 

Of course, the selected tag pairs are the best matching of 
the  bipartite  graph  between  multimedia  resources 
and

; 
(2)  Computing  the  position  information  of  each  tag, 

which is denoted as 

 

               (14); 

(3)  Add  the  position  information  of  each  tag  to  the 

equation 13, which can be seen as a decline factor: 

    (15) 

(4)  Of  course,  similar  to  maxRel  function,  equation 

should divide the result of the maximization by 

        (16) 

Besides the cardinality of two tags set 

and

, 

the  maxRel  function  is  affected  by  the  relatedness  be-
tween  each  pair  of  tags.  According  to  heuristics  4  and  5, 
the  redundancy  and  noise  should  be  avoided.  In  maxRel 
function,  the  one-to-one  map  is  applied  to  the  tags 

and

.  Thus,  the  proposed  maxRel  function  varies 

with respect to the nature of two multimedia resources.  

Adopting  the  proposed  maxRel  function,  we  are  sure 
to  find  the  global  maximum  relatedness  that  can  be  ob-
tained pairing the elements in the two tags sets. Alterna-
tive  methods  are  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum 
since  they  scroll  the  elements  in  the  first  set  and,  after 
calculating  the  relatedness  with  all  the  elements  in  the 
second  set,  they  select  the  one  with  the  maximum  relat-
edness. Since every element in one set must be connected, 
at most, at one element in the other set, such a procedure 
is  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum  since  it  depends 
on  the  order  in  which  the  comparisons  occur.  For  exam-
ple, considering the example in Fig. 3, t1 will be paired to 
q1  (weight=1.0).  But,  when  analyzing  t3  the  maximum 
weight is with q2 (weight=0.9). This means that t2 can no 
more  be  paired  to  q2  even  if  the  weight  is  maximum, 
since  this  is  already  matched  to  t3.  As  a  consequence,  t2 
will  be  paired  to  q3  and  the  average  of  the  selected 
weights  will  be  (1.0+0.3+0.9)/3=0.73  which  is  considera-
bly  lower  than  using  maxRel  where  the  sum  of  the 
weights was (1.0+0.8+0.7)/3=0.83. 

Overall, the cardinality of two tag sets is used to follow 
heuristic  3.  The  one-to-one  map  of  tags  pair  is  used  to 
follow heuristics 4 and 5. The maxRel function is used to 
match a best semantic relatedness integration of two mul-
timedia resources. 

4.3  Tag Order Revision 

According  to  heuristic  2,  the  order  of  tags  should  be 
considered to  compute the  semantic relatedness between 
two multimedia resources. Intuitively, the tags appearing 
in the first position may be more important than the latter 
tags.  Some  researches  [30]  suggest  that  people  used  to 
select  popular  items  as  their  tags.  Meanwhile,  the  top 
popular tags are indeed the ―meaningful‖ ones.  

In this section, the maxRel function proposed in section 
4.2 is revised considering the order of tags. For example, 
the  relatedness  of  tag  pair  with  high  position  should  be

.  

Besides  adding  decline  factor  to  the  maxRel  function, 

we also add a constrain schema: identical tag pruning.  

Schema  2.  Identical  tag  pruning.  This  schema  means 
 
that the identical tag pairs of two multimedia resources
and 
should  be  pruned  in  maxRel  function.  In  other 
words,  the  semantic  relatedness  of  the  same  tag  of  two 
multimedia resources is set as 0. 

The  above  schema  is  used  to  ensure  the  relatedness 
measures  of  two  multimedia  resources.  If  we  do  not 
prune the identical tag pairs of two multimedia resources, 
the proposed method will be transformed to the similari-
ty  measures.  For  example,  the  cosine  similarity  between 
two  tags  is  to  find  the  number  of  identical  elements  of 
two  vectors.  The  overall  algorithm  of  the  proposed  com-
putation mode is presented in algorithm 1. 

5  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  results  of  using  the  pro-
posed method for relatedness measurement. In section 5.1, 
we introduce the data set for the evaluation. In section 5.2, 
we  determine  to  use  the  co-occurrence  function  for  tag 
relatedness  measures.  In  section  5.3  and  5.4,  clustering 
and retrieval are used for evaluate the proposed method. 
In  section  5.5,  some  discussions  about  the  experimental 
results are given.  

5.1  The Data Sets 

We choose Flickr groups as the resources for building data 
sets. Users on online photo sharing sites like Flickr have or-
ganized  many  millions  of  photos  into  hundreds  of  thou-
sands of semantically themed groups. These groups expose 
implicit  choices  that  users  make  about  which  images  are 
similar. Flickr group membership is usually less noisy than 
Flickr tags because images are screened by group members. 
We  download  100  thousand  images  with  tags  from  100 
groups. The tags  of these images are extracted.  Each  group 
means a concept. Thus, if the proposed method can do well 
in these groups, we may say that it can measure the semantic 
relatedness  between  Flickr  images  accurately  and  robustly. 
Table  2  gives  the  detailed  information  of  some  selected 

Figure 9. The top five searching results from Flickr 

 

group  of  the  data  set.  Some  selected  images  from  some 
groups are shown in Fig. 4. Table 3 gives some selected tags. 

5.2  Relatedness Function Selection 

In  the  section  4.1,  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI)  are  given  for  relatedness 
measures  between  tags.  In  [31],  Rubenstein  and  Goode-
nough  proposed  a  dataset  containing  28  word-pairs  rating 
by a group of 51 human subjects, which is a reliable bench-
mark for evaluating semantic similarity measures. The high-
er the correlation coefficient against R-G ratings is, the more 
accurate the methods for measuring semantic similarity be-
tween  words  are.  Fig.  5  gives  the  correlation  coefficient  of 
four functions against R-G test set. From Fig. 5, we can say 
that PMI performs best on relatedness measures for its high-
est correlation coefficient. Thus, in the latter experiments, we 
select PMI as the relatedness measures between tags. 

5.3  Evaluation on Image Clustering 

In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  correctness  of  using  tag 
order. In section 4.3, we add the position information of each 
tag to the semantic relatedness measures. The tags with high 
position are treated as the major element for sematic related-
ness  measures.  We  evaluate  the  using  of  tag  order  by  the 
clustering  task.  We  employ  the  proposed  semantic  related-
ness of images into K-means [32] clustering model. Since the 
K-means  model  depends  on  the  initial  points,  we  random

For  example,  the  tag  ―Cartier‖  of  the  top  50  images  is  re-
moved of the query ―Cartier‖. The reason for that operation 
is that the proposed method is based on the semantic relat-
edness  other  than  co-occurrence.  We  choose  cut-off  point 
precision to evaluate the proposed method on image search-
ing. The cut-off point precision (Pn) means that the percent-
age  of  the  correct  result  of  the  top  n  returned  results.  We 
compute the P1, P5, and P10 of the group2 test set. Table 4 lists 
the  comparison  of  the  cut-off  point  precision  between  the 
proposed method and Flickr. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 give the top 5 
results  of  the  five  test  queries  from  the  proposed  method 
and Flickr7. Especially, we put the red rectangle to the wrong 
search  results  in  Fig.  9.  From  the  experimental  results,  we 
can conclude that: 

(1) The proposed method performs better than Flickr. In 
table 4, the P1, P5, and P10 of the proposed method are higher 
than Flickr. The experimental results prove the correctness of 
the proposed method on image searching task. 

(2) The  proposed  method  is  effective  on  image  search-
ing task. In Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we compare the top 5 returned 
results  by  the  proposed  method  and  Flickr.  It  is  obviously 
that  the  returned  results  from  Flick  are  rough.  Some  re-
turned images are irrelevant to the given query. For example, 
in Fig. 9, almost 40% searching results are incorrect.  

(3) The  proposed  method  can  handle  the  relatedness 
searching problem. The proposed method can measure the 
semantic relatedness of two images robust and correctly. In 
Fig. 8, the tags of the search results do not contain the search 
query, which is  different  from the traditional  co-occurrence 
based search mechanism.    

(4) The proposed method can support the faceted explo-
ration of image search. Faceted exploration of search results 
is widely used in search interfaces for structured databases. 
Recently the faceted exploration is also appearing in on-line 
search engine in the form of search assistants. The proposed 
method can measure the semantic relatedness of two images. 
Given  the  search  queries,  we  can  select  the  related  images 
for faceted search. 

6  APPLICATIONS 

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the application of 
computer  vision  techniques  to  the  image  retrieval  prob-
lem, that is, the problem of searching for digital images in 
large  databases.  "Content-based"  means  that  the  search 
analyzes  the  contents  of  the  image  rather  than  the 
metadata  such  as  keywords,  tags,  or  descriptions  associ-
ated  with  the  image.  The  term  "content"  in  this  context 
might  refer  to  colors,  shapes,  textures,  or  any  other  in-
formation that can be derived from the image itself. CBIR 
is  desirable  because  most  web-based  image  search  en-
gines  rely  purely  on  metadata  and  this  produces  a  lot  of 
garbage  in  the  results.  Also  having  humans  manually

select core points 100 times. We evaluate the effectiveness of 
document clustering with three quality measures: F-measure, 
Purity, and Entropy [32]. We treat each cluster as if it were the 
result of the proposed method and each class as if it were the 
desired set of images. Generally, we would like to maximize 
the  F-measure  and  Purity,  and  minimize  the  Entropy  of  the 
clusters  to  achieve  a  high-quality  document  clustering. 
Moreover,  we  compare  the  clustering  results  between  the 
proposed  method  using  tag  order  or  not.  Fig.  6  and  Fig.  7 
give  the  clustering  results  of  group1  and  group2  data  sets. 
From Fig. 6 and Fig.7, we can conclude that: 

(1) The  proposed  method  performs  better  than  cosine 
based clustering. This result can be obtained from Fig. 6 and 
Fig.  7.  The  three  metrics  including  F-measure,  purity,  and 
entropy of the proposed method are better than cosine based 
clustering. This may be caused by the inherent feature of the 
proposed  method.  The  proposed  method  is  based  on  the 
semantic relatedness other than the co-occurrence of the co-
sine based clustering. If the tags of two images are not over-
lapped, the cosine based clustering may be unavailable.  

(2) The schema on using of tag order is effective. This re-
sult  can  also  be  obtained  from  Fig.  6  and  Fig.  7.  The  three 
metrics  including  F-measure,  purity,  and  entropy  of  using 
tag  order  are  highest.  The  position  information  reflects  the 
importance  of  each  tag.  The  proposed  method  emphasizes 
the  tags  with  high  order,  which  raises  the  performance  on 
images clustering. 

(3) The proposed method is robust in different data sets. 
The proposed method performs well in group1 and group2 
data  set.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  difference  between  the 
proposed  method  and  cosine  method  of  group2  is  higher 
than that of group1. The reason of that is due to the semantic 
correlation  of  group2  being  stronger  than  group1.  In  other 
words,  the  performance  of  the  proposed  method  relies  on 
the semantic correlation of classes in data sets. The stronger 
the  semantic  correlation  between  classes  of  data,  the  better 
the proposed method performs.

Organizing Multimedia Big Data

Abstract—Recent research shows that multimedia resources “in the wild” are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In 
this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network model  is  used for  organizing multimedia  resources.  A  whole  model for  generating  the 
association relation between multimedia resources using Semantic Link Network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the Semantic Link 
Network  and  multimedia  resources  provides  a  new  prospect  for  organizing  them  with  their  semantics.  The  tags  and  the 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to  measure  their  semantic  association.  The  hierarchical  semantic  of 
multimedia resources are defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts 
are  different  in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic  Link  Network  model  are  implemented  to  measure 
association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two 
evaluation  methods  including  clustering  and  retrieval  are  performed,  which  shows  the  proposed  method  can  measure  the 
semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.

1  INTRODUCTION

R 

ECENTLY, Big data is an emerging paradigm applied 
to  datasets  whose  size  is  beyond  the  ability  of  com-
monly  used  software  tools  to  capture,  manage,  and  pro-
cess the data within a tolerable elapsed time [10]. Various 
technologies are being discussed to support the handling 
of  big  data  such  as  massively  parallel  processing  data-
bases [11], scalable storage systems [12, 33], cloud compu-
ting platforms [13, 34], and MapReduce [14, 35].   

Understanding  the  semantics  of  multimedia  has  been 
an  important  component  in  many  multimedia  based  ap-
plications. Manual annotation and tagging has been con-
sidered as a reliable source of multimedia semantics. Un-
fortunately,  manual  annotation  is  time-consuming  and 
expensive  when  dealing  with  huge  scale  of  multimedia 
data. Advances in Semantic Web [15] have made ontology 
another  useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  seman-
tics. Ontology builds a formal and explicit representation 
of  semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  rela-
tionships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive 
implicit  knowledge.  However,  the  semantic  gap  [16]  be-
tween  semantics  and  video  visual  appearance  is  still  a 
challenge  towards  automated  ontology-driven  video  an-
notation. With the rapid growth of video resources on the 
world-wide-web,  for  example,  on  YouTube 1  alone,  35 
hours  of  video  are  unloaded  every  minute  [2],  and  over 
700 billion videos were watched in 2010.  Vast amount of 
videos  with  no  metadata  have  emerged.  Thus  automati-
cally understanding raw multimedia solely based on their

visual  appearance  becomes  an  important  yet  challenging 
problem. Multimedia resources ―in the wild‖ are growing 
at  a  staggering  rate  [1,  2].  The  rapid  increase  number  of 
multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent  need  to  de-
velop intelligent methods to represent and annotate them. 
Typical  applications  in  which  representing  and  annotat-
ing  video  events  include  criminal  investigation  systems 
[3],  video  surveillance  [4],  intrusion  detection  system  [5], 
video  resources  browsing  and  indexing  system  [6],  sport 
events  detection  [7],  internet  of  things  [8,  9],  and  many 
others.  These  urgent  needs  have  posed  challenges  for 
multimedia  resources  management,  and  have  attracted 
the  research  of  the  multimedia  analysis  and  understand-
ing. Overall, the goal is to enable users to search the relat-
ed  resources  from  the  huge  number  of  multimedia  re-
sources.  

With  the  explosion  of  community  contributed  multi-
media content available online, many social media reposi-
tories (e.g. Flickr2, YouTube, and Zooomr3) allow users to 
upload media data and annotate content with descriptive 
keywords which are called social tags. Flickr provides an 
open  platform  for  users  to  publish  their  personal  images 
freely. The principal purpose of tagging is to make imag-
es  better  accessible  to  the  public.  The  success  of  Flickr 
proves that users are willing to participate in this seman-
tic context through manual annotations [17]. Flickr uses a 
promising  approach  for  manual  metadata  generation 
named  ―social  tagging‖,  which  requires  all  the  users  in 
the  social  network  label  the  multimedia  resources  with 
their own keywords and share with others. The character-
istics of social tags are as follows.

(1)  Ontology  free.  The  ontology  based  labeling  de-
fines  ontology  and  then  let  users  label  the  multimedia 
resources  using  the  semantic  markups  in  the  ontology. 
Social tagging requires all the users in the social network 
label the  multimedia resources with their  own keywords 
and share with others. Different from ontology based an-
notation.  There  is  no  pre-defined  ontology  or  taxonomy 
in  social  tagging.  Thus  the  tagging  task  is  more  conven-
ient for users.  

(2)  User  oriented.  The  users  can  annotate  images 
with their favorite tags. The tags of multimedia resources 
are  determined  by  users‘  cognitive  ability.  To  the  multi-
media resources, users may give different tags. Each mul-
timedia  resource  may  be  with  one  tag  at  least,  and  each 
tag may appear in many different multimedia resources. 

(3) 

Semantic  loss.  Irrelevant  social  tags  frequently 
appear,  and  users  typically  will  not  tag  all  semantic  ob-
jects in the image, which is called semantic loss. Polysemy, 
synonyms,  and  ambiguity  are  some  drawbacks  of  social 
tagging. 

In this paper, the Semantic Link Network (SLN) [18, 19, 
20]  model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources 
with  social  tags.  Semantic  Link  Network  is  designed  to 
establish  associated  relations  among  various  resources 
(e.g.,  Web  pages  or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming 
at extending the loosely connected network of no seman-
tics  (e.g.,  the  Web)  to  an  association-rich  network.  Since 
the theory of cognitive science considers that the associat-
ed  relations  can  make  one  resource  more  comprehensive 
to users [21], the motivation of SLN is to organize the as-
sociated  resources  loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  ef-
fectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as 
browsing,  knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness 
between  tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in 
the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  The  major  contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized as follow.  

(1) A  whole  model  for  generating  the  association  rela-
tion  between  multimedia  resources  using  Semantic  Link 
Network  model  is  proposed.  The  definitions,  modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used 
in the proposed method. The integration between the Se-
mantic Link Network and multimedia resources provides 
a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. 
(2) The  tags  and  the  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia 
resources are used to measure their semantic association.  
The  hierarchical  semantic  of  multimedia  resources  are 
defined  by  their  annotated  tags  and  surrounding  texts. 
The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different 
in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic 
Link Network model are implemented to measure associ-
ation relations. 

(3) A real data set including 100 thousand images with 
social  tags  from  Flickr  is  used  in  our  experiments.  Two 
evaluation methods including clustering and retrieval are 
performed, which shows the proposed method can meas-
ure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accu-
rately and robustly. 

(4) The  relatedness  measures  between  concepts  are  ex-

tended  to  the  level  of  multimedia.  Since  the  association 
relation  is  the  basic  mechanism  of  brain.  The  proposed 
Semantic Link Network based model can help the multi-
media  related  applications  such  as  searching  and  recom-
mendation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
gives  the  related  work  of  social  tags  and  semantic  link 
network. The problem definition is introduced in Section 
3.  Section  4  proposes  the  method  for  measuring  associa-
tion of multimedia. Experiments are presented in Section 
5. Conclusions are made in the last section. 

2  RELATED WORK 

Advances  in  Semantic  Web  have  made  ontology  another 
useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  semantics.  The 
ontology  builds  a  formal  and  explicit  representation  of 
semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  relation-
ships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive im-
plicit  knowledge.  In  this  section,  the  related  work  of  the 
proposed  model  is  given.  The  Semantic  Web  [15]  is  an 
evolving development of the World Wide Web, in which 
the meanings of information on the web is defined; there-
fore,  it  is  possible  for  machines  to  process  it.  The  basic 
idea  of  Semantic  Web  is  to  use  ontological  concepts  and 
vocabularies to accurately describe contents in a machine 
readable  way.  These  concepts  and  vocabularies  can  then 
be shared and retrieved on the web. In the Semantic Web, 
each fragment of the description is a triple, based on De-
scription  Logic.  Thus,  the  implicit  connections  and  se-
mantics within the description fragments can be reasoned 
using  Description  Logic  theory  and  ontological  defini-
tions. Earlier research work on the Semantic Web focused 
on  defining  domain  specific  ontologies  and  reasoning 
technologies.  Therefore,  data  are  only  meaningful  in  cer-
tain  domains  and  are  not  connected  to  each  other  from 
the World Wide Web point of view, which certainly limits 
the  contributions  of  Semantic  Web  for  sharing  and  re-
trieving contents within a distributed environment. 

The  Semantic  Link  Network  (SLN)  was  proposed  as  a 
semantic  data  model  for  organizing  various  Web  re-
sources  by  extending  the  Web‘s  hyperlink  to  a  semantic 
link.  SLN  is  a  directed  network  consisting  of  semantic 
nodes and semantic links. A semantic node can be a con-
cept, an instance of concept, a schema of data set, a URL, 
any  form  of  resources,  or  even  an  SLN.  A  semantic  link 
reflects  a  kind  of  relational  knowledge  represented  as  a 
pointer  with  a  tag  describing  such  semantic  relations  as 
cause  Effect,  implication,  subtype,  similar,  instance,  se-
quence,  reference,  and  equal.  The  semantics  of  tags  are 
usually common sense and can be regulated by its catego-
ry,  relevant  reasoning  rules,  and  use  cases.  A  set  of  gen-
eral  semantic  relation  reasoning  rules  was  suggested  in 
[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-
verse  relations  are  knowledge  for  supporting  semantic 
relation reasoning. SLN is a self-organized network since 
any node can link to any other node via a semantic link.

3.2 The Basic Definitions 

SLN  has  been  used  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  query 
routing  in  P2P  network  [24],  and  it  has  been  adopted  as 
one of the major mechanisms of organizing resources for 
the  Knowledge  Grid.  Pons  has  successfully  applied  the 
SLN  to  object  prefetching  and  achieved  a  better  result 
than other approaches [25]. 

3  THE SEMANTIC LINK NETWORK BASED MODEL  

The  tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources 
are  used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  related-
ness between tags and  surrounding texts are implement-
ed  in  the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  In  this  section, 
the  details  of  the  proposed  model  are  given.  The  basic 
definitions, representations, heuristics are introduced. 

3.1  The Basic Mechanisms of the Proposed Model 
SLN can be formalized into a loosely coupled semantic 
model for managing various resources. As a data model, 
the  proposed  model  consists  of  the  following  parts,  as 
shown in Fig. 1. 

1)  Resources  representation  mechanism.  Element 
Fuzzy  Cognitive  Map  (E-FCM)  [19]  is  used  to  represent 
multimedia  resources  with  social  tags  since  it  does  not 
only  reserve  resources‘  keywords  but  also  the  relations 
among them. 

2)  Resources  storage  mechanism.  Database/XML  is 
used to store E-FCM since it is easy to define the mark-up 
elements. 

3)  SLN  generation  mechanism.  Based  on  E-FCM  and 
the  association  rules,  ALN  can  be  generated  by  machine 
automatically.  

4)  Application  mechanism.  SLN  can  be  used  for  Web 
intelligence  activities,  Web  knowledge  discovery  and 
publishing,  etc.  For  example,  when  a  user  browses  mul-
timedia,  other  resources  with  semantic  links  to  it  can  be 
recommended to the user. 

The  three  important  definitions  are  defined  firstly  in 
this  paper  including  the  social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia 
resource and the semantic relatedness between two  mul-
timedia resources. 

Definition  1:  Social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia  resource. 
The  social  tags  (denoted  by  t)  set  of  a  multimedia  re-
source f (denoted by s(f)) is a set of tags provided by users. 

                    (1) 

Definition  2:  Semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The 
) 

semantic  relatedness  between  tags  (denoted  by 

is the expected correlation of a pair of tags 

 and 

. 

Definition  3:  Semantic  relatedness  between  two  mul-
timedia  resources.  The  semantic  relatedness  between 
multimedia  resources  (denoted  by
)  is  the  ex-

pected  correlation  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources 

and 

. 

The range of 

 is from 0 to 1. A high value indi-

cates that semantic relatedness between tags is more like-
ly to be confidential.  

3.3  The Basic Heuristics 

Based  on  common  sense  and  our  observations  on  real 
data, five heuristics that serve as the base of the proposed 
computation model are given as follow. 

Heuristic 1. Usually each tag of a multimedia resource 

appears only one time. 

Different  from  writing  sentences,  users  usually  anno-
tate a multimedia resource with different tags. For exam-
ple,  the  possibility  of  using  tags  ―apple  apple  apple‖  for 
an image is very low. Therefore, in this paper, we do not 
employ any weighting scheme for tags such as tf-idf [26]. 
Heuristic 2. The order of the tags may reflect the corre-

lation against the annotated multimedia resource. 

Different tag reflects the different aspect of a multime-
dia resource. According to Heuristic 1, the weight of a tag 
against  the  image  cannot  be  obtained.  Fortunately,  the 
order  of  the  tags  can  be  get  since  user  may  provide  tags

one by one.  

Heuristic  3.  The  number  of  tags  of  a  multimedia  re-

source may not relevant to the annotation correctness. 

Different users may give different tags about the same 
multimedia  resource.  For  example,  users  may  give  tags 
such as ―apple iPhone‖ or ―iPhone4 mobile phone‖ for  a 
same image about iPhone. It is hardly to say which tag is 
better  for  annotation  though  the  latter  annotation  has 
three tags. 

Heuristic  4.  Usually  some  tags  may  be  redundant  for 

annotating a multimedia resource. 

Of  course,  users  may  give  similar  tags  for  a  multime-
dia  resource.  For  example,  the  tags  ―apple  iPhone‖  may 
be  redundant  since  iPhone  is  very  semantic  similar  to 
apple.  

Heuristic 5. Usually some tags may be noisy for anno-

tating a multimedia resource. 

Users  may  give  inappropriate  or  even  false  tags  for  a 
multimedia resource. For example, the tags  ―iPhone‖ are 
false for an image about the iPod. 

4  GENERATING THE SEMANTIC LINK  

In this section, the computation model for generating the 
semantic link between multimedia resources is proposed. 
Based on the above five heuristics, the social tags provid-
ed by users are used in our computation model. Overall, 
the  proposed  computation  model  is  divided  into  three 
steps. 

(1) Tag relatedness computation. In this step, based on 
heuristic  1,  all  of  the  tag  pairs  between  two  multimedia 
resources are computed. 

(2) Semantic  relatedness  integration.  In  this  step, 
based on heuristics 3-5, the semantic relatedness between 
multimedia resources is computed. 

(3) Tag order revision. In this step, based on heuristic 2, 

the multimedia resources relatedness on step 2 is revised. 
Table 1 shows the variables and parameters used in the 
following discussion. Fig. 2 illustrates an overview of the 
proposed computation model. 

4.1  Tag Relatedness Computation 

According to definition 1, a multimedia resource can be 
represented as a set of tags provided by users. As for the 
semantic  relatedness  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources, 
we can measure the semantic relatedness between tags of 
these  multimedia  resources.  For  example,  two  multime-
dia resources with tags ―apple iPhone‖ and ―iPod Nano‖, 
we  can  measure  the  semantic  relatedness  between  these 
tags. Since the number of each tag is usually one accord-
ing  to  heuristic  1,  the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags 
can be computed without considering their weight.  

Many  different  methods  of  semantic  relatedness 
measures  between  concepts  have  been  proposed,  which 
can  be  divided  into  two  aspects  [27]:  taxonomy-based 
methods  and  web-based  methods.  Taxonomy-based 
methods  use  information  theory  and  hierarchical  taxon-
omy, such as WordNet, to measure semantic  relatedness. 
On the contrary, web-based methods use the web as a live 
and active corpus instead of hierarchical taxonomy.  

In  the  proposed  computation  model,  each  tag  can  be 
seen  as  a  concept  with  explicit  meaning.  Thus,  we  use 
some  equations  based  on  co-occurrence  of  two  concepts 
to  measure  their  semantic  relatedness.  The  core  idea  is 
that ‗you shall know a word by the company it keeps‘ [28]. 
In this section, four popular co-occurrence measures (i.e., 
Jaccard,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI  [29])  are  proposed  to 
measure semantic relatedness between tags. 

Besides  co-occurrence  measures,  the  page  counts  of 
each tag from search engine are used.  Page counts mean 
the number of web pages containing the query q. For ex-
ample,  the  page  counts  of  the  query  ‗Obama‘  in  Google4 
are 1,210,000,0005. Moreover, page counts for the query ‗q 
AND p‘ can be considered as a measure of co-occurrence 
of  queries  q  and  p.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we 
use  the  notation 
 to  denote  the  page  counts  of  the 
tag p in Google. However, the respective page counts for

the tag pair p and q are not enough for measuring seman-
 
tic relatedness. The page counts for the query ‗p AND q‘ 
 
should  be  considered.  For  example,  when  we  query 
 
‗Obama‘  and  ‗United  States‘  in  Google,  we  can  find 
 
485,000,000  Web  pages,  that  is, 
 
=485,000,000.  The  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card, Overlap, Dice, and PMI) between two tags p and q 
are as follows:

According to probability and information theory, the mu-
tual information (MI) of two random variables is a quanti-
ty that measures the mutual dependence of the two vari-

MI (Equation (5)):

where N is the number of Web pages in the search engine, 
which  is  set  to

dexed pages reported by Google.

latedness as follows:

                           (7) 

next section, we will give the detailed analysis for choos-
ing the best measures from equations 2-5.  

Overall,  the  page  counts  of  each  tag  should  be  issued. 
Then the co-occurrence based measure is used to compute 
the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The  reasons  for 
using page counts based measures are as follow. 

(1)  Appropriate  computation  complexity.  Since  the 
relatedness  between  each  tag  pair  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources should be computed, the proposed method must 
be  with  low  complexity.  Recently,  web  search  engines 
such  as  Google  provide  API  for  users  to  index  the  page 
counts  of  each  query.  The  web  search  engine  gives  an 
appropriate interface for the proposed computation mod-
el. 

(2)  Explicit  semantics.  The  tag  given  by  users  may 
not be a correct concept in taxonomy. For example, users 
may  give  a  tag  ―Bling  Bling‖  for  a  multimedia  resource 
about  a  lovely  girl.  The  word  ―Bling‖  cannot  be  indexed

4.2  Semantic Relatedness Integration 

In  section  4.1,  we  compute  the  tag  pair  relatedness  of 
two  multimedia  resources.  Obviously,  the  tag  pair  relat-
edness  of  two  multimedia  resources 
 can  be 
treated as a bipartite graph, which is denoted as  

 and

is  highest.  Fig.  3  shows  a  graphical  representation  of  the 
semantic  relatedness  integration,  where  the  bold  lines 
constitute the matching M. 

Based  on  the  expressing  of  the  assignment  in  bipartite 

graphs, we have 

    (11) 

 (12) 

Based  on  the  equation  11,  we  change  the  semantic  re-
latedness integration of all tag pairs to the  assignment in 
bipartite graph problem. We want to assign a best match-
ing of the bipartite graph G.  

A matching is defined as 

so that no two edges in 
M share a common end vertex. An assignment in a bipar-
tite graph is a matching M so that each node of the graph 
has an incident edge in M. Suppose that the set of vertices 
are partitioned in two sets 
and , and that the edges of 
the graph have an associated weight given by a  function

.  The  function  maxRel: 

returns  the  maximum  weighted  assignment,  i.e.,  an  as-
signment  so  that  the average  of  the  weights  of  the edges 

Using  the  assignment  in  bipartite  graphs  problem  to 
our context, the variables

timedia  resources  to  compute  the  semantic  relatedness. 
For example, that

means that the number of tags in

we  divide  the  result  of  the  maximization  by  the  lower 
cardinality  of

or

the  number  of  tags  is  reduced,  and  the  semantic  related-
ness of two multimedia resources is symmetric.

enhanced, which is summarized as a constrain schema: 

Schema  1.  Tag  relatedness  declining.  This  schema 
means  that  the  identical  tag  pairs  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources
should be pruned in maxRel function. In 
other  words,  the  semantic  relatedness  of  the  same  tag  of 
two multimedia resources is set as 0. 

 and 

We add a decline factor to the maxRel function, and the 

detailed steps are: 

(1)  According  to  the  maxRel  function  in  section  4.2, 
the best matching tag pairs are selected, which is denoted 
as: 

 (13) 

Of course, the selected tag pairs are the best matching of 
the  bipartite  graph  between  multimedia  resources 
and

; 
(2)  Computing  the  position  information  of  each  tag, 

which is denoted as 

 

               (14); 

(3)  Add  the  position  information  of  each  tag  to  the 

equation 13, which can be seen as a decline factor: 

    (15) 

(4)  Of  course,  similar  to  maxRel  function,  equation 

should divide the result of the maximization by 

        (16) 

Besides the cardinality of two tags set 

and

, 

the  maxRel  function  is  affected  by  the  relatedness  be-
tween  each  pair  of  tags.  According  to  heuristics  4  and  5, 
the  redundancy  and  noise  should  be  avoided.  In  maxRel 
function,  the  one-to-one  map  is  applied  to  the  tags 

and

.  Thus,  the  proposed  maxRel  function  varies 

with respect to the nature of two multimedia resources.  

Adopting  the  proposed  maxRel  function,  we  are  sure 
to  find  the  global  maximum  relatedness  that  can  be  ob-
tained pairing the elements in the two tags sets. Alterna-
tive  methods  are  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum 
since  they  scroll  the  elements  in  the  first  set  and,  after 
calculating  the  relatedness  with  all  the  elements  in  the 
second  set,  they  select  the  one  with  the  maximum  relat-
edness. Since every element in one set must be connected, 
at most, at one element in the other set, such a procedure 
is  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum  since  it  depends 
on  the  order  in  which  the  comparisons  occur.  For  exam-
ple, considering the example in Fig. 3, t1 will be paired to 
q1  (weight=1.0).  But,  when  analyzing  t3  the  maximum 
weight is with q2 (weight=0.9). This means that t2 can no 
more  be  paired  to  q2  even  if  the  weight  is  maximum, 
since  this  is  already  matched  to  t3.  As  a  consequence,  t2 
will  be  paired  to  q3  and  the  average  of  the  selected 
weights  will  be  (1.0+0.3+0.9)/3=0.73  which  is  considera-
bly  lower  than  using  maxRel  where  the  sum  of  the 
weights was (1.0+0.8+0.7)/3=0.83. 

Overall, the cardinality of two tag sets is used to follow 
heuristic  3.  The  one-to-one  map  of  tags  pair  is  used  to 
follow heuristics 4 and 5. The maxRel function is used to 
match a best semantic relatedness integration of two mul-
timedia resources. 

4.3  Tag Order Revision 

According  to  heuristic  2,  the  order  of  tags  should  be 
considered to  compute the  semantic relatedness between 
two multimedia resources. Intuitively, the tags appearing 
in the first position may be more important than the latter 
tags.  Some  researches  [30]  suggest  that  people  used  to 
select  popular  items  as  their  tags.  Meanwhile,  the  top 
popular tags are indeed the ―meaningful‖ ones.  

In this section, the maxRel function proposed in section 
4.2 is revised considering the order of tags. For example, 
the  relatedness  of  tag  pair  with  high  position  should  be

.  

Besides  adding  decline  factor  to  the  maxRel  function, 

we also add a constrain schema: identical tag pruning.  

Schema  2.  Identical  tag  pruning.  This  schema  means 
 
that the identical tag pairs of two multimedia resources
and 
should  be  pruned  in  maxRel  function.  In  other 
words,  the  semantic  relatedness  of  the  same  tag  of  two 
multimedia resources is set as 0. 

The  above  schema  is  used  to  ensure  the  relatedness 
measures  of  two  multimedia  resources.  If  we  do  not 
prune the identical tag pairs of two multimedia resources, 
the proposed method will be transformed to the similari-
ty  measures.  For  example,  the  cosine  similarity  between 
two  tags  is  to  find  the  number  of  identical  elements  of 
two  vectors.  The  overall  algorithm  of  the  proposed  com-
putation mode is presented in algorithm 1. 

5  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  results  of  using  the  pro-
posed method for relatedness measurement. In section 5.1, 
we introduce the data set for the evaluation. In section 5.2, 
we  determine  to  use  the  co-occurrence  function  for  tag 
relatedness  measures.  In  section  5.3  and  5.4,  clustering 
and retrieval are used for evaluate the proposed method. 
In  section  5.5,  some  discussions  about  the  experimental 
results are given.  

5.1  The Data Sets 

We choose Flickr groups as the resources for building data 
sets. Users on online photo sharing sites like Flickr have or-
ganized  many  millions  of  photos  into  hundreds  of  thou-
sands of semantically themed groups. These groups expose 
implicit  choices  that  users  make  about  which  images  are 
similar. Flickr group membership is usually less noisy than 
Flickr tags because images are screened by group members. 
We  download  100  thousand  images  with  tags  from  100 
groups. The tags  of these images are extracted.  Each  group 
means a concept. Thus, if the proposed method can do well 
in these groups, we may say that it can measure the semantic 
relatedness  between  Flickr  images  accurately  and  robustly. 
Table  2  gives  the  detailed  information  of  some  selected 

Figure 9. The top five searching results from Flickr 

 

group  of  the  data  set.  Some  selected  images  from  some 
groups are shown in Fig. 4. Table 3 gives some selected tags. 

5.2  Relatedness Function Selection 

In  the  section  4.1,  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI)  are  given  for  relatedness 
measures  between  tags.  In  [31],  Rubenstein  and  Goode-
nough  proposed  a  dataset  containing  28  word-pairs  rating 
by a group of 51 human subjects, which is a reliable bench-
mark for evaluating semantic similarity measures. The high-
er the correlation coefficient against R-G ratings is, the more 
accurate the methods for measuring semantic similarity be-
tween  words  are.  Fig.  5  gives  the  correlation  coefficient  of 
four functions against R-G test set. From Fig. 5, we can say 
that PMI performs best on relatedness measures for its high-
est correlation coefficient. Thus, in the latter experiments, we 
select PMI as the relatedness measures between tags. 

5.3  Evaluation on Image Clustering 

In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  correctness  of  using  tag 
order. In section 4.3, we add the position information of each

selected  as  the  test  set  including  ―Louis  Vuitton‖,  ―Gucci‖, 
―Chanel‖, ―Cartier‖, and ―Dior‖. These queries are searched 
in  Flickr.  The  top  50  images  are  obtained  as  the  data  set. 
Moreover, we remove the queries on the tags of each image. 
For  example,  the  tag  ―Cartier‖  of  the  top  50  images  is  re-
moved of the query ―Cartier‖. The reason for that operation 
is that the proposed method is based on the semantic relat-
edness  other  than  co-occurrence.  We  choose  cut-off  point 
precision to evaluate the proposed method on image search-
ing. The cut-off point precision (Pn) means that the percent-
age  of  the  correct  result  of  the  top  n  returned  results.  We 
compute the P1, P5, and P10 of the group2 test set. Table 4 lists 
the  comparison  of  the  cut-off  point  precision  between  the 
proposed method and Flickr. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 give the top 5 
results  of  the  five  test  queries  from  the  proposed  method 
and Flickr7. Especially, we put the red rectangle to the wrong 
search  results  in  Fig.  9.  From  the  experimental  results,  we 
can conclude that: 

(1) The proposed method performs better than Flickr. In 
table 4, the P1, P5, and P10 of the proposed method are higher 
than Flickr. The experimental results prove the correctness of 
the proposed method on image searching task. 

(2) The  proposed  method  is  effective  on  image  search-
ing task. In Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we compare the top 5 returned 
results  by  the  proposed  method  and  Flickr.  It  is  obviously 
that  the  returned  results  from  Flick  are  rough.  Some  re-
turned images are irrelevant to the given query. For example, 
in Fig. 9, almost 40% searching results are incorrect.  

(3) The  proposed  method  can  handle  the  relatedness 
searching problem. The proposed method can measure the 
semantic relatedness of two images robust and correctly. In 
Fig. 8, the tags of the search results do not contain the search 
query, which is  different  from the traditional  co-occurrence 
based search mechanism.    

(4) The proposed method can support the faceted explo-
ration of image search. Faceted exploration of search results 
is widely used in search interfaces for structured databases. 
Recently the faceted exploration is also appearing in on-line 
search engine in the form of search assistants. The proposed 
method can measure the semantic relatedness of two images. 
Given  the  search  queries,  we  can  select  the  related  images 
for faceted search. 

6  APPLICATIONS 

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the application of 
computer  vision  techniques  to  the  image  retrieval  prob-
lem, that is, the problem of searching for digital images in 
large  databases.  "Content-based"  means  that  the  search 
analyzes  the  contents  of  the  image  rather  than  the 
metadata  such  as  keywords,  tags,  or  descriptions  associ-
ated  with  the  image.  The  term  "content"  in  this  context 
might  refer  to  colors,  shapes,  textures,  or  any  other  in-
formation that can be derived from the image itself. CBIR 
is  desirable  because  most  web-based  image  search  en-
gines  rely  purely  on  metadata  and  this  produces  a  lot  of 
garbage  in  the  results.  Also  having  humans  manually

select core points 100 times. We evaluate the effectiveness of 
document clustering with three quality measures: F-measure, 
Purity, and Entropy [32]. We treat each cluster as if it were the 
result of the proposed method and each class as if it were the 
desired set of images. Generally, we would like to maximize 
the  F-measure  and  Purity,  and  minimize  the  Entropy  of  the 
clusters  to  achieve  a  high-quality  document  clustering. 
Moreover,  we  compare  the  clustering  results  between  the 
proposed  method  using  tag  order  or  not.  Fig.  6  and  Fig.  7 
give  the  clustering  results  of  group1  and  group2  data  sets. 
From Fig. 6 and Fig.7, we can conclude that: 

(1) The  proposed  method  performs  better  than  cosine 
based clustering. This result can be obtained from Fig. 6 and 
Fig.  7.  The  three  metrics  including  F-measure,  purity,  and 
entropy of the proposed method are better than cosine based 
clustering. This may be caused by the inherent feature of the 
proposed  method.  The  proposed  method  is  based  on  the 
semantic relatedness other than the co-occurrence of the co-
sine based clustering. If the tags of two images are not over-
lapped, the cosine based clustering may be unavailable.  

(2) The schema on using of tag order is effective. This re-
sult  can  also  be  obtained  from  Fig.  6  and  Fig.  7.  The  three 
metrics  including  F-measure,  purity,  and  entropy  of  using 
tag  order  are  highest.  The  position  information  reflects  the 
importance  of  each  tag.  The  proposed  method  emphasizes 
the  tags  with  high  order,  which  raises  the  performance  on 
images clustering. 

(3) The proposed method is robust in different data sets. 
The proposed method performs well in group1 and group2 
data  set.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  difference  between  the 
proposed  method  and  cosine  method  of  group2  is  higher 
than that of group1. The reason of that is due to the semantic 
correlation  of  group2  being  stronger  than  group1.  In  other 
words,  the  performance  of  the  proposed  method  relies  on 
the semantic correlation of classes in data sets. The stronger 
the  semantic  correlation  between  classes  of  data,  the  better 
the proposed method performs. 

5.4  Evaluation on Image Searching

enter keywords for images in a large database can be inef-
ficient,  expensive  and  may  not  capture  every  keyword 
that  describes  the  image.  Thus  a  system  that  can  filter 
images  based  on  their  content  would  provide  better  in-
dexing and return more accurate results. 

The proposed SLN based model can be used for video 
searching.  The  ontology  based  video  searching  is  similar 
to CBIR, which also focuses on the content of the videos. 
Fig. 10 gives the searching interface of the developed tool 
based  on  the  proposed  SLN  based  model.  From  Fig.  10, 
the searching procedures for a user are as follow. 

 (1) Ontology based queries. Different from web search 
engines,  the  proposed  SLN  based  video  search  constricts 
the  searching  method.  Users  can  only  select  the  defined 
attributes or concepts as the searching queries.  

(2)  Associated  videos  suggestion.  Since  the  video  re-
sources  are  organized  by  their  association  relation,  the 
associated videos can be suggested to the users.  

7  CONCLUSION 

Recent research shows that  multimedia resources ―in the 
wild‖ are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number  of  multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent 
need to develop intelligent methods to organize and pro-
cess  them.  In  this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network 
model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources.  Se-
mantic Link Network (SLN) is designed to establish asso-
ciated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages 
or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming  at  extending  the 
loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) 
to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cogni-
tive  science  considers  that  the  associated  relations  can 
make one resource more comprehensive to users, the mo-
tivation  of  SLN  is  to  organize  the  associated  resources 
loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  effectively  supporting 
the  Web 
intelligent  activities  such  as  browsing, 
knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The  tags  and 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to 
represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness  between 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in  the  se-
mantic  Link  Network  model.  The  data  sets  including 
about  100  thousand  images  with  social  tags  from  Flickr 
are used to evaluate the proposed method. Two data min-
ing  tasks  including  clustering  and  searching  are  per-
formed  by  the  proposed  framework,  which  shows  the 
effectiveness and robust of the proposed framework.

Abstract—Recent research shows that multimedia resources “in the wild” are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number of multimedia resources has brought an urgent need to develop intelligent methods to organize and process them. In 
this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network model  is  used for  organizing multimedia  resources.  A  whole  model for  generating  the 
association relation between multimedia resources using Semantic Link Network model is proposed. The definitions, modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used in the proposed method. The integration between the Semantic Link 
Network  and  multimedia  resources  provides  a  new  prospect  for  organizing  them  with  their  semantics.  The  tags  and  the 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to  measure  their  semantic  association.  The  hierarchical  semantic  of 
multimedia resources are defined by their annotated tags and surrounding texts. The semantics of tags and surrounding texts 
are  different  in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic  Link  Network  model  are  implemented  to  measure 
association relations. A real data set including 100 thousand images with social tags from Flickr is used in our experiments. Two 
evaluation  methods  including  clustering  and  retrieval  are  performed,  which  shows  the  proposed  method  can  measure  the 
semantic relatedness between Flickr images accurately and robustly.

1  INTRODUCTION

R 

ECENTLY, Big data is an emerging paradigm applied 
to  datasets  whose  size  is  beyond  the  ability  of  com-
monly  used  software  tools  to  capture,  manage,  and  pro-
cess the data within a tolerable elapsed time [10]. Various 
technologies are being discussed to support the handling 
of  big  data  such  as  massively  parallel  processing  data-
bases [11], scalable storage systems [12, 33], cloud compu-
ting platforms [13, 34], and MapReduce [14, 35].   

Understanding  the  semantics  of  multimedia  has  been 
an  important  component  in  many  multimedia  based  ap-
plications. Manual annotation and tagging has been con-
sidered as a reliable source of multimedia semantics. Un-
fortunately,  manual  annotation  is  time-consuming  and 
expensive  when  dealing  with  huge  scale  of  multimedia 
data. Advances in Semantic Web [15] have made ontology 
another  useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  seman-
tics. Ontology builds a formal and explicit representation 
of  semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  rela-
tionships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive 
implicit  knowledge.  However,  the  semantic  gap  [16]  be-
tween  semantics  and  video  visual  appearance  is  still  a 
challenge  towards  automated  ontology-driven  video  an-
notation. With the rapid growth of video resources on the 
world-wide-web,  for  example,  on  YouTube 1  alone,  35 
hours  of  video  are  unloaded  every  minute  [2],  and  over 
700 billion videos were watched in 2010.  Vast amount of 
videos  with  no  metadata  have  emerged.  Thus  automati-
cally understanding raw multimedia solely based on their

visual  appearance  becomes  an  important  yet  challenging 
problem. Multimedia resources ―in the wild‖ are growing 
at  a  staggering  rate  [1,  2].  The  rapid  increase  number  of 
multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent  need  to  de-
velop intelligent methods to represent and annotate them. 
Typical  applications  in  which  representing  and  annotat-
ing  video  events  include  criminal  investigation  systems 
[3],  video  surveillance  [4],  intrusion  detection  system  [5], 
video  resources  browsing  and  indexing  system  [6],  sport 
events  detection  [7],  internet  of  things  [8,  9],  and  many 
others.  These  urgent  needs  have  posed  challenges  for 
multimedia  resources  management,  and  have  attracted 
the  research  of  the  multimedia  analysis  and  understand-
ing. Overall, the goal is to enable users to search the relat-
ed  resources  from  the  huge  number  of  multimedia  re-
sources.  

With  the  explosion  of  community  contributed  multi-
media content available online, many social media reposi-
tories (e.g. Flickr2, YouTube, and Zooomr3) allow users to 
upload media data and annotate content with descriptive 
keywords which are called social tags. Flickr provides an 
open  platform  for  users  to  publish  their  personal  images 
freely. The principal purpose of tagging is to make imag-
es  better  accessible  to  the  public.  The  success  of  Flickr 
proves that users are willing to participate in this seman-
tic context through manual annotations [17]. Flickr uses a 
promising  approach  for  manual  metadata  generation 
named  ―social  tagging‖,  which  requires  all  the  users  in 
the  social  network  label  the  multimedia  resources  with 
their own keywords and share with others. The character-
istics of social tags are as follows.

(1)  Ontology  free.  The  ontology  based  labeling  de-
fines  ontology  and  then  let  users  label  the  multimedia 
resources  using  the  semantic  markups  in  the  ontology. 
Social tagging requires all the users in the social network 
label the  multimedia resources with their  own keywords 
and share with others. Different from ontology based an-
notation.  There  is  no  pre-defined  ontology  or  taxonomy 
in  social  tagging.  Thus  the  tagging  task  is  more  conven-
ient for users.  

(2)  User  oriented.  The  users  can  annotate  images 
with their favorite tags. The tags of multimedia resources 
are  determined  by  users‘  cognitive  ability.  To  the  multi-
media resources, users may give different tags. Each mul-
timedia  resource  may  be  with  one  tag  at  least,  and  each 
tag may appear in many different multimedia resources. 

(3) 

Semantic  loss.  Irrelevant  social  tags  frequently 
appear,  and  users  typically  will  not  tag  all  semantic  ob-
jects in the image, which is called semantic loss. Polysemy, 
synonyms,  and  ambiguity  are  some  drawbacks  of  social 
tagging. 

In this paper, the Semantic Link Network (SLN) [18, 19, 
20]  model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources 
with  social  tags.  Semantic  Link  Network  is  designed  to 
establish  associated  relations  among  various  resources 
(e.g.,  Web  pages  or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming 
at extending the loosely connected network of no seman-
tics  (e.g.,  the  Web)  to  an  association-rich  network.  Since 
the theory of cognitive science considers that the associat-
ed  relations  can  make  one  resource  more  comprehensive 
to users [21], the motivation of SLN is to organize the as-
sociated  resources  loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  ef-
fectively supporting the Web intelligent activities such as 
browsing,  knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are 
used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness 
between  tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in 
the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  The  major  contribu-
tions of this paper are summarized as follow.  

(1) A  whole  model  for  generating  the  association  rela-
tion  between  multimedia  resources  using  Semantic  Link 
Network  model  is  proposed.  The  definitions,  modules, 
and mechanisms of the Semantic Link Network are used 
in the proposed method. The integration between the Se-
mantic Link Network and multimedia resources provides 
a new prospect for organizing them with their semantics. 
(2) The  tags  and  the  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia 
resources are used to measure their semantic association.  
The  hierarchical  semantic  of  multimedia  resources  are 
defined  by  their  annotated  tags  and  surrounding  texts. 
The semantics of tags and surrounding texts are different 
in  the  proposed  framework.  The  modules  of  Semantic 
Link Network model are implemented to measure associ-
ation relations. 

(3) A real data set including 100 thousand images with 
social  tags  from  Flickr  is  used  in  our  experiments.  Two 
evaluation methods including clustering and retrieval are 
performed, which shows the proposed method can meas-
ure the semantic relatedness between Flickr images accu-
rately and robustly. 

(4) The  relatedness  measures  between  concepts  are  ex-

tended  to  the  level  of  multimedia.  Since  the  association 
relation  is  the  basic  mechanism  of  brain.  The  proposed 
Semantic Link Network based model can help the multi-
media  related  applications  such  as  searching  and  recom-
mendation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
gives  the  related  work  of  social  tags  and  semantic  link

2  RELATED WORK 

Advances  in  Semantic  Web  have  made  ontology  another 
useful  source  for  describing  multimedia  semantics.  The 
ontology  builds  a  formal  and  explicit  representation  of 
semantic  hierarchies  for  the  concepts  and  their  relation-
ships in video events, and allows reasoning to derive im-
plicit  knowledge.  In  this  section,  the  related  work  of  the 
proposed  model  is  given.  The  Semantic  Web  [15]  is  an 
evolving development of the World Wide Web, in which 
the meanings of information on the web is defined; there-
fore,  it  is  possible  for  machines  to  process  it.  The  basic 
idea  of  Semantic  Web  is  to  use  ontological  concepts  and 
vocabularies to accurately describe contents in a machine 
readable  way.  These  concepts  and  vocabularies  can  then 
be shared and retrieved on the web. In the Semantic Web, 
each fragment of the description is a triple, based on De-
scription  Logic.  Thus,  the  implicit  connections  and  se-
mantics within the description fragments can be reasoned 
using  Description  Logic  theory  and  ontological  defini-
tions. Earlier research work on the Semantic Web focused 
on  defining  domain  specific  ontologies  and  reasoning 
technologies.  Therefore,  data  are  only  meaningful  in  cer-
tain  domains  and  are  not  connected  to  each  other  from 
the World Wide Web point of view, which certainly limits 
the  contributions  of  Semantic  Web  for  sharing  and  re-
trieving contents within a distributed environment. 

The  Semantic  Link  Network  (SLN)  was  proposed  as  a 
semantic  data  model  for  organizing  various  Web  re-
sources  by  extending  the  Web‘s  hyperlink  to  a  semantic 
link.  SLN  is  a  directed  network  consisting  of  semantic 
nodes and semantic links. A semantic node can be a con-
cept, an instance of concept, a schema of data set, a URL, 
any  form  of  resources,  or  even  an  SLN.  A  semantic  link 
reflects  a  kind  of  relational  knowledge  represented  as  a 
pointer  with  a  tag  describing  such  semantic  relations  as 
cause  Effect,  implication,  subtype,  similar,  instance,  se-
quence,  reference,  and  equal.  The  semantics  of  tags  are 
usually common sense and can be regulated by its catego-
ry,  relevant  reasoning  rules,  and  use  cases.  A  set  of  gen-
eral  semantic  relation  reasoning  rules  was  suggested  in 
[22]  and  [23].  If  a  semantic  link  exists  between  nodes,  a 
link of reverse relation may exist. A relation could have a 
reverse  relation.  Relations  and  their  corresponding  re-
verse  relations  are  knowledge  for  supporting  semantic 
relation reasoning. SLN is a self-organized network since 
any node can link to any other node via a semantic link.

3.2 The Basic Definitions 

SLN  has  been  used  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  query 
routing  in  P2P  network  [24],  and  it  has  been  adopted  as 
one of the major mechanisms of organizing resources for 
the  Knowledge  Grid.  Pons  has  successfully  applied  the 
SLN  to  object  prefetching  and  achieved  a  better  result 
than other approaches [25]. 

3  THE SEMANTIC LINK NETWORK BASED MODEL  

The  tags  and  surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources 
are  used  to  represent  the  semantic  content.  The  related-
ness between tags and  surrounding texts are implement-
ed  in  the  Semantic  Link  Network  model.  In  this  section, 
the  details  of  the  proposed  model  are  given.  The  basic 
definitions, representations, heuristics are introduced. 

3.1  The Basic Mechanisms of the Proposed Model 
SLN can be formalized into a loosely coupled semantic 
model for managing various resources. As a data model, 
the  proposed  model  consists  of  the  following  parts,  as 
shown in Fig. 1. 

1)  Resources  representation  mechanism.  Element 
Fuzzy  Cognitive  Map  (E-FCM)  [19]  is  used  to  represent 
multimedia  resources  with  social  tags  since  it  does  not 
only  reserve  resources‘  keywords  but  also  the  relations 
among them. 

2)  Resources  storage  mechanism.  Database/XML  is 
used to store E-FCM since it is easy to define the mark-up 
elements. 

3)  SLN  generation  mechanism.  Based  on  E-FCM  and 
the  association  rules,  ALN  can  be  generated  by  machine 
automatically.  

4)  Application  mechanism.  SLN  can  be  used  for  Web 
intelligence  activities,  Web  knowledge  discovery  and 
publishing,  etc.  For  example,  when  a  user  browses  mul-
timedia,  other  resources  with  semantic  links  to  it  can  be 
recommended to the user. 

The  three  important  definitions  are  defined  firstly  in 
this  paper  including  the  social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia 
resource and the semantic relatedness between two  mul-
timedia resources. 

Definition  1:  Social  tags  set  of  a  multimedia  resource. 
The  social  tags  (denoted  by  t)  set  of  a  multimedia  re-
source f (denoted by s(f)) is a set of tags provided by users. 

                    (1) 

Definition  2:  Semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The 
) 

semantic  relatedness  between  tags  (denoted  by 

is the expected correlation of a pair of tags 

 and 

. 

Definition  3:  Semantic  relatedness  between  two  mul-
timedia  resources.  The  semantic  relatedness  between 
multimedia  resources  (denoted  by
)  is  the  ex-

pected  correlation  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources 

and 

. 

The range of 

 is from 0 to 1. A high value indi-

cates that semantic relatedness between tags is more like-
ly to be confidential.  

3.3  The Basic Heuristics 

Based  on  common  sense  and  our  observations  on  real 
data, five heuristics that serve as the base of the proposed 
computation model are given as follow. 

Heuristic 1. Usually each tag of a multimedia resource 

appears only one time. 

Different  from  writing  sentences,  users  usually  anno-
tate a multimedia resource with different tags. For exam-
ple,  the  possibility  of  using  tags  ―apple  apple  apple‖  for 
an image is very low. Therefore, in this paper, we do not 
employ any weighting scheme for tags such as tf-idf [26]. 
Heuristic 2. The order of the tags may reflect the corre-

lation against the annotated multimedia resource. 

Different tag reflects the different aspect of a multime-
dia resource. According to Heuristic 1, the weight of a tag 
against  the  image  cannot  be  obtained.  Fortunately,  the 
order  of  the  tags  can  be  get  since  user  may  provide  tags

one by one.  

Heuristic  3.  The  number  of  tags  of  a  multimedia  re-

source may not relevant to the annotation correctness. 

Different users may give different tags about the same 
multimedia  resource.  For  example,  users  may  give  tags 
such as ―apple iPhone‖ or ―iPhone4 mobile phone‖ for  a 
same image about iPhone. It is hardly to say which tag is 
better  for  annotation  though  the  latter  annotation  has 
three tags. 

Heuristic  4.  Usually  some  tags  may  be  redundant  for 

annotating a multimedia resource. 

Of  course,  users  may  give  similar  tags  for  a  multime-
dia  resource.  For  example,  the  tags  ―apple  iPhone‖  may 
be  redundant  since  iPhone  is  very  semantic  similar  to 
apple.  

Heuristic 5. Usually some tags may be noisy for anno-

tating a multimedia resource. 

Users  may  give  inappropriate  or  even  false  tags  for  a 
multimedia resource. For example, the tags  ―iPhone‖ are 
false for an image about the iPod. 

4  GENERATING THE SEMANTIC LINK  

In this section, the computation model for generating the 
semantic link between multimedia resources is proposed. 
Based on the above five heuristics, the social tags provid-
ed by users are used in our computation model. Overall, 
the  proposed  computation  model  is  divided  into  three 
steps. 

(1) Tag relatedness computation. In this step, based on 
heuristic  1,  all  of  the  tag  pairs  between  two  multimedia 
resources are computed. 

(2) Semantic  relatedness  integration.  In  this  step, 
based on heuristics 3-5, the semantic relatedness between 
multimedia resources is computed. 

(3) Tag order revision. In this step, based on heuristic 2, 

the multimedia resources relatedness on step 2 is revised. 
Table 1 shows the variables and parameters used in the 
following discussion. Fig. 2 illustrates an overview of the 
proposed computation model. 

4.1  Tag Relatedness Computation 

According to definition 1, a multimedia resource can be 
represented as a set of tags provided by users. As for the 
semantic  relatedness  of  a  pair  of  multimedia  resources, 
we can measure the semantic relatedness between tags of 
these  multimedia  resources.  For  example,  two  multime-
dia resources with tags ―apple iPhone‖ and ―iPod Nano‖, 
we  can  measure  the  semantic  relatedness  between  these 
tags. Since the number of each tag is usually one accord-
ing  to  heuristic  1,  the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags 
can be computed without considering their weight.  

Many  different  methods  of  semantic  relatedness 
measures  between  concepts  have  been  proposed,  which 
can  be  divided  into  two  aspects  [27]:  taxonomy-based 
methods  and  web-based  methods.  Taxonomy-based 
methods  use  information  theory  and  hierarchical  taxon-
omy, such as WordNet, to measure semantic  relatedness. 
On the contrary, web-based methods use the web as a live 
and active corpus instead of hierarchical taxonomy.  

In  the  proposed  computation  model,  each  tag  can  be 
seen  as  a  concept  with  explicit  meaning.  Thus,  we  use 
some  equations  based  on  co-occurrence  of  two  concepts 
to  measure  their  semantic  relatedness.  The  core  idea  is 
that ‗you shall know a word by the company it keeps‘ [28]. 
In this section, four popular co-occurrence measures (i.e., 
Jaccard,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI  [29])  are  proposed  to 
measure semantic relatedness between tags. 

Besides  co-occurrence  measures,  the  page  counts  of 
each tag from search engine are used.  Page counts mean 
the number of web pages containing the query q. For ex-
ample,  the  page  counts  of  the  query  ‗Obama‘  in  Google4 
are 1,210,000,0005. Moreover, page counts for the query ‗q 
AND p‘ can be considered as a measure of co-occurrence 
of  queries  q  and  p.  For  the  remainder  of  this  paper,  we 
use  the  notation 
 to  denote  the  page  counts  of  the 
tag p in Google. However, the respective page counts for

the tag pair p and q are not enough for measuring seman-
 
tic relatedness. The page counts for the query ‗p AND q‘ 
 
should  be  considered.  For  example,  when  we  query 
 
‗Obama‘  and  ‗United  States‘  in  Google,  we  can  find 
 
485,000,000  Web  pages,  that  is, 
 
=485,000,000.  The  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card, Overlap, Dice, and PMI) between two tags p and q 
are as follows:

equation can be:

According to probability and information theory, the mu-
tual information (MI) of two random variables is a quanti-
ty that measures the mutual dependence of the two vari-
ables. Pointwise mutual information (PMI) is a variant of 
MI (Equation (5)): 

       (5) 

where N is the number of Web pages in the search engine, 
which  is  set  to 
 according  to  the  number  of  in-
dexed pages reported by Google. 

Through the equations 2-5, we can compute the tag re-

latedness as follows: 

(1)  Extracting  the  tags  from  two  multimedia  re-

sources

                           (6) 

                           (7) 

next section, we will give the detailed analysis for choos-
ing the best measures from equations 2-5.  

Overall,  the  page  counts  of  each  tag  should  be  issued. 
Then the co-occurrence based measure is used to compute 
the  semantic  relatedness  between  tags.  The  reasons  for 
using page counts based measures are as follow. 

(1)  Appropriate  computation  complexity.  Since  the 
relatedness  between  each  tag  pair  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources should be computed, the proposed method must 
be  with  low  complexity.  Recently,  web  search  engines 
such  as  Google  provide  API  for  users  to  index  the  page 
counts  of  each  query.  The  web  search  engine  gives  an 
appropriate interface for the proposed computation mod-
el. 

(2)  Explicit  semantics.  The  tag  given  by  users  may 
not be a correct concept in taxonomy. For example, users 
may  give  a  tag  ―Bling  Bling‖  for  a  multimedia  resource 
about  a  lovely  girl.  The  word  ―Bling‖  cannot  be  indexed

method uses web search engine as an open intermediate. 
The  explicit  semantics  of  the  newly  emerge  concepts  can 
be get by web easily. 

4.2  Semantic Relatedness Integration 

In  section  4.1,  we  compute  the  tag  pair  relatedness  of 
two  multimedia  resources.  Obviously,  the  tag  pair  relat-
edness  of  two  multimedia  resources 
 can  be 
treated as a bipartite graph, which is denoted as  

 and

is  highest.  Fig.  3  shows  a  graphical  representation  of  the 
semantic  relatedness  integration,  where  the  bold  lines 
constitute the matching M. 

Based  on  the  expressing  of  the  assignment  in  bipartite 

graphs, we have 

    (11) 

 (12) 

Based  on  the  equation  11,  we  change  the  semantic  re-
latedness integration of all tag pairs to the  assignment in 
bipartite graph problem. We want to assign a best match-
ing of the bipartite graph G.  

A matching is defined as 

so that no two edges in 
M share a common end vertex. An assignment in a bipar-
tite graph is a matching M so that each node of the graph 
has an incident edge in M. Suppose that the set of vertices 
are partitioned in two sets 
and , and that the edges of 
the graph have an associated weight given by a  function

.  The  function  maxRel: 

returns  the  maximum  weighted  assignment,  i.e.,  an  as-
signment  so  that  the average  of  the  weights  of  the edges 

Using  the  assignment  in  bipartite  graphs  problem  to 
our context, the variables 
and represent the two mul-
timedia  resources  to  compute  the  semantic  relatedness. 
For example, that 

and are composed of the tags 

and

. 

means that the number of tags in 

is lower than that of 

. According to heuristic 3, 

we  divide  the  result  of  the  maximization  by  the  lower 
cardinality  of 
.  In  this  way,  the  influence  of 

or

the  number  of  tags  is  reduced,  and  the  semantic  related-
ness of two multimedia resources is symmetric.

enhanced, which is summarized as a constrain schema: 

Schema  1.  Tag  relatedness  declining.  This  schema 
means  that  the  identical  tag  pairs  of  two  multimedia  re-
sources
should be pruned in maxRel function. In 
other  words,  the  semantic  relatedness  of  the  same  tag  of 
two multimedia resources is set as 0. 

 and 

We add a decline factor to the maxRel function, and the 

detailed steps are: 

(1)  According  to  the  maxRel  function  in  section  4.2, 
the best matching tag pairs are selected, which is denoted 
as: 

 (13) 

Of course, the selected tag pairs are the best matching of 
the  bipartite  graph  between  multimedia  resources 
and

; 
(2)  Computing  the  position  information  of  each  tag, 

which is denoted as 

 

               (14); 

(3)  Add  the  position  information  of  each  tag  to  the 

equation 13, which can be seen as a decline factor: 

    (15) 

(4)  Of  course,  similar  to  maxRel  function,  equation 

should divide the result of the maximization by 

        (16) 

Besides the cardinality of two tags set 

and

, 

the  maxRel  function  is  affected  by  the  relatedness  be-
tween  each  pair  of  tags.  According  to  heuristics  4  and  5, 
the  redundancy  and  noise  should  be  avoided.  In  maxRel 
function,  the  one-to-one  map  is  applied  to  the  tags 

and

.  Thus,  the  proposed  maxRel  function  varies 

with respect to the nature of two multimedia resources.  

Adopting  the  proposed  maxRel  function,  we  are  sure 
to  find  the  global  maximum  relatedness  that  can  be  ob-
tained pairing the elements in the two tags sets. Alterna-
tive  methods  are  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum 
since  they  scroll  the  elements  in  the  first  set  and,  after 
calculating  the  relatedness  with  all  the  elements  in  the 
second  set,  they  select  the  one  with  the  maximum  relat-
edness. Since every element in one set must be connected, 
at most, at one element in the other set, such a procedure 
is  able  to  find  only  the  local  maximum  since  it  depends 
on  the  order  in  which  the  comparisons  occur.  For  exam-
ple, considering the example in Fig. 3, t1 will be paired to 
q1  (weight=1.0).  But,  when  analyzing  t3  the  maximum 
weight is with q2 (weight=0.9). This means that t2 can no 
more  be  paired  to  q2  even  if  the  weight  is  maximum, 
since  this  is  already  matched  to  t3.  As  a  consequence,  t2 
will  be  paired  to  q3  and  the  average  of  the  selected 
weights  will  be  (1.0+0.3+0.9)/3=0.73  which  is  considera-
bly  lower  than  using  maxRel  where  the  sum  of  the 
weights was (1.0+0.8+0.7)/3=0.83. 

Overall, the cardinality of two tag sets is used to follow 
heuristic  3.  The  one-to-one  map  of  tags  pair  is  used  to 
follow heuristics 4 and 5. The maxRel function is used to 
match a best semantic relatedness integration of two mul-
timedia resources. 

4.3  Tag Order Revision 

According  to  heuristic  2,  the  order  of  tags  should  be 
considered to  compute the  semantic relatedness between 
two multimedia resources. Intuitively, the tags appearing 
in the first position may be more important than the latter 
tags.  Some  researches  [30]  suggest  that  people  used  to 
select  popular  items  as  their  tags.  Meanwhile,  the  top 
popular tags are indeed the ―meaningful‖ ones.  

In this section, the maxRel function proposed in section 
4.2 is revised considering the order of tags. For example, 
the  relatedness  of  tag  pair  with  high  position  should  be

We  also  consider  the  example  in  Fig.  3.  According  to 
equation  16,  the  semantic  relatedness  is  revised  as

.  

Besides  adding  decline  factor  to  the  maxRel  function, 

we also add a constrain schema: identical tag pruning.  

Schema  2.  Identical  tag  pruning.  This  schema  means 
 
that the identical tag pairs of two multimedia resources
and 
should  be  pruned  in  maxRel  function.  In  other 
words,  the  semantic  relatedness  of  the  same  tag  of  two 
multimedia resources is set as 0. 

The  above  schema  is  used  to  ensure  the  relatedness 
measures  of  two  multimedia  resources.  If  we  do  not 
prune the identical tag pairs of two multimedia resources, 
the proposed method will be transformed to the similari-
ty  measures.  For  example,  the  cosine  similarity  between 
two  tags  is  to  find  the  number  of  identical  elements  of 
two  vectors.  The  overall  algorithm  of  the  proposed  com-
putation mode is presented in algorithm 1. 

5  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 

In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  results  of  using  the  pro-
posed method for relatedness measurement. In section 5.1, 
we introduce the data set for the evaluation. In section 5.2, 
we  determine  to  use  the  co-occurrence  function  for  tag 
relatedness  measures.  In  section  5.3  and  5.4,  clustering 
and retrieval are used for evaluate the proposed method. 
In  section  5.5,  some  discussions  about  the  experimental 
results are given.  

5.1  The Data Sets 

We choose Flickr groups as the resources for building data 
sets. Users on online photo sharing sites like Flickr have or-
ganized  many  millions  of  photos  into  hundreds  of  thou-
sands of semantically themed groups. These groups expose 
implicit  choices  that  users  make  about  which  images  are 
similar. Flickr group membership is usually less noisy than 
Flickr tags because images are screened by group members. 
We  download  100  thousand  images  with  tags  from  100 
groups. The tags  of these images are extracted.  Each  group 
means a concept. Thus, if the proposed method can do well 
in these groups, we may say that it can measure the semantic 
relatedness  between  Flickr  images  accurately  and  robustly. 
Table  2  gives  the  detailed  information  of  some  selected 

Figure 9. The top five searching results from Flickr 

 

group  of  the  data  set.  Some  selected  images  from  some 
groups are shown in Fig. 4. Table 3 gives some selected tags. 

5.2  Relatedness Function Selection 

In  the  section  4.1,  four  co-occurrence  measures  (i.e.,  Jac-
card,  Overlap,  Dice,  and  PMI)  are  given  for  relatedness 
measures  between  tags.  In  [31],  Rubenstein  and  Goode-
nough  proposed  a  dataset  containing  28  word-pairs  rating 
by a group of 51 human subjects, which is a reliable bench-
mark for evaluating semantic similarity measures. The high-
er the correlation coefficient against R-G ratings is, the more 
accurate the methods for measuring semantic similarity be-
tween  words  are.  Fig.  5  gives  the  correlation  coefficient  of 
four functions against R-G test set. From Fig. 5, we can say 
that PMI performs best on relatedness measures for its high-
est correlation coefficient. Thus, in the latter experiments, we 
select PMI as the relatedness measures between tags. 

5.3  Evaluation on Image Clustering 

In  this  section,  we  evaluate  the  correctness  of  using  tag 
order. In section 4.3, we add the position information of each 
tag to the semantic relatedness measures. The tags with high 
position are treated as the major element for sematic related-
ness  measures.  We  evaluate  the  using  of  tag  order  by  the 
clustering  task.  We  employ  the  proposed  semantic  related-
ness of images into K-means [32] clustering model. Since the 
K-means  model  depends  on  the  initial  points,  we  random

selected  as  the  test  set  including  ―Louis  Vuitton‖,  ―Gucci‖, 
―Chanel‖, ―Cartier‖, and ―Dior‖. These queries are searched 
in  Flickr.  The  top  50  images  are  obtained  as  the  data  set. 
Moreover, we remove the queries on the tags of each image. 
For  example,  the  tag  ―Cartier‖  of  the  top  50  images  is  re-
moved of the query ―Cartier‖. The reason for that operation 
is that the proposed method is based on the semantic relat-
edness  other  than  co-occurrence.  We  choose  cut-off  point 
precision to evaluate the proposed method on image search-
ing. The cut-off point precision (Pn) means that the percent-
age  of  the  correct  result  of  the  top  n  returned  results.  We 
compute the P1, P5, and P10 of the group2 test set. Table 4 lists 
the  comparison  of  the  cut-off  point  precision  between  the 
proposed method and Flickr. Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 give the top 5 
results  of  the  five  test  queries  from  the  proposed  method 
and Flickr7. Especially, we put the red rectangle to the wrong 
search  results  in  Fig.  9.  From  the  experimental  results,  we 
can conclude that: 

(1) The proposed method performs better than Flickr. In 
table 4, the P1, P5, and P10 of the proposed method are higher 
than Flickr. The experimental results prove the correctness of 
the proposed method on image searching task. 

(2) The  proposed  method  is  effective  on  image  search-
ing task. In Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we compare the top 5 returned 
results  by  the  proposed  method  and  Flickr.  It  is  obviously 
that  the  returned  results  from  Flick  are  rough.  Some  re-
turned images are irrelevant to the given query. For example, 
in Fig. 9, almost 40% searching results are incorrect.  

(3) The  proposed  method  can  handle  the  relatedness 
searching problem. The proposed method can measure the 
semantic relatedness of two images robust and correctly. In 
Fig. 8, the tags of the search results do not contain the search 
query, which is  different  from the traditional  co-occurrence 
based search mechanism.    

(4) The proposed method can support the faceted explo-
ration of image search. Faceted exploration of search results 
is widely used in search interfaces for structured databases. 
Recently the faceted exploration is also appearing in on-line 
search engine in the form of search assistants. The proposed 
method can measure the semantic relatedness of two images. 
Given  the  search  queries,  we  can  select  the  related  images 
for faceted search. 

6  APPLICATIONS 

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the application of 
computer  vision  techniques  to  the  image  retrieval  prob-
lem, that is, the problem of searching for digital images in 
large  databases.  "Content-based"  means  that  the  search 
analyzes  the  contents  of  the  image  rather  than  the 
metadata  such  as  keywords,  tags,  or  descriptions  associ-
ated  with  the  image.  The  term  "content"  in  this  context 
might  refer  to  colors,  shapes,  textures,  or  any  other  in-
formation that can be derived from the image itself. CBIR 
is  desirable  because  most  web-based  image  search  en-
gines  rely  purely  on  metadata  and  this  produces  a  lot  of 
garbage  in  the  results.  Also  having  humans  manually

select core points 100 times. We evaluate the effectiveness of 
document clustering with three quality measures: F-measure, 
Purity, and Entropy [32]. We treat each cluster as if it were the 
result of the proposed method and each class as if it were the 
desired set of images. Generally, we would like to maximize 
the  F-measure  and  Purity,  and  minimize  the  Entropy  of  the 
clusters  to  achieve  a  high-quality  document  clustering. 
Moreover,  we  compare  the  clustering  results  between  the 
proposed  method  using  tag  order  or  not.  Fig.  6  and  Fig.  7 
give  the  clustering  results  of  group1  and  group2  data  sets. 
From Fig. 6 and Fig.7, we can conclude that: 

(1) The  proposed  method  performs  better  than  cosine 
based clustering. This result can be obtained from Fig. 6 and 
Fig.  7.  The  three  metrics  including  F-measure,  purity,  and 
entropy of the proposed method are better than cosine based 
clustering. This may be caused by the inherent feature of the 
proposed  method.  The  proposed  method  is  based  on  the 
semantic relatedness other than the co-occurrence of the co-
sine based clustering. If the tags of two images are not over-
lapped, the cosine based clustering may be unavailable.  

(2) The schema on using of tag order is effective. This re-
sult  can  also  be  obtained  from  Fig.  6  and  Fig.  7.  The  three 
metrics  including  F-measure,  purity,  and  entropy  of  using 
tag  order  are  highest.  The  position  information  reflects  the 
importance  of  each  tag.  The  proposed  method  emphasizes 
the  tags  with  high  order,  which  raises  the  performance  on 
images clustering. 

(3) The proposed method is robust in different data sets. 
The proposed method performs well in group1 and group2 
data  set.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  difference  between  the 
proposed  method  and  cosine  method  of  group2  is  higher 
than that of group1. The reason of that is due to the semantic 
correlation  of  group2  being  stronger  than  group1.  In  other 
words,  the  performance  of  the  proposed  method  relies  on 
the semantic correlation of classes in data sets. The stronger 
the  semantic  correlation  between  classes  of  data,  the  better 
the proposed method performs. 

5.4  Evaluation on Image Searching

enter keywords for images in a large database can be inef-
ficient,  expensive  and  may  not  capture  every  keyword 
that  describes  the  image.  Thus  a  system  that  can  filter 
images  based  on  their  content  would  provide  better  in-
dexing and return more accurate results. 

The proposed SLN based model can be used for video 
searching.  The  ontology  based  video  searching  is  similar 
to CBIR, which also focuses on the content of the videos. 
Fig. 10 gives the searching interface of the developed tool 
based  on  the  proposed  SLN  based  model.  From  Fig.  10, 
the searching procedures for a user are as follow. 

 (1) Ontology based queries. Different from web search 
engines,  the  proposed  SLN  based  video  search  constricts 
the  searching  method.  Users  can  only  select  the  defined 
attributes or concepts as the searching queries.  

(2)  Associated  videos  suggestion.  Since  the  video  re-
sources  are  organized  by  their  association  relation,  the 
associated videos can be suggested to the users.  

7  CONCLUSION 

Recent research shows that  multimedia resources ―in the 
wild‖ are growing at a staggering rate. The rapid increase 
number  of  multimedia  resources  has  brought  an  urgent 
need to develop intelligent methods to organize and pro-
cess  them.  In  this  paper,  the  Semantic  Link  Network 
model  is  used  for  organizing  multimedia  resources.  Se-
mantic Link Network (SLN) is designed to establish asso-
ciated relations among various resources (e.g., Web pages 
or  documents  in  digital  library)  aiming  at  extending  the 
loosely connected network of no semantics (e.g., the Web) 
to an association-rich network. Since the theory of cogni-
tive  science  considers  that  the  associated  relations  can 
make one resource more comprehensive to users, the mo-
tivation  of  SLN  is  to  organize  the  associated  resources 
loosely  distributed  in  the  Web  for  effectively  supporting 
the  Web 
intelligent  activities  such  as  browsing, 
knowledge  discovery  and  publishing,  etc.  The  tags  and 
surrounding  texts  of  multimedia  resources  are  used  to 
represent  the  semantic  content.  The  relatedness  between 
tags  and  surrounding  texts  are  implemented  in  the  se-
mantic  Link  Network  model.  The  data  sets  including 
about  100  thousand  images  with  social  tags  from  Flickr 
are used to evaluate the proposed method. Two data min-
ing  tasks  including  clustering  and  searching  are  per-
formed  by  the  proposed  framework,  which  shows  the 
effectiveness and robust of the proposed framework.
