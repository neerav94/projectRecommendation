Abstract.  The  application  direction  of  the  big  data  should  focus  on  the 
meaningful  information  offering  for  creating  the  customer.  If  the  car 
maintenance  industry  is  associated  with  the  big  data  and  the  car  maintenance 
record  management  system  can  be  implemented,  the  independently  performed 
customer management program by maintenance enterprise and database will be 
able  to  be  integrated  and  it  will  be  able  to  systematize.  First,  the  integrating 
database construction of the auto repair shop customer management program is 
proposed.  Second,  the  person  cloud  computing  system  connected  with  the 
Smart  phone  to  the  method  that  customer  can  confirm  the  real-time  analysis 
data,  that  is  the  advantage  of  the  big  data  analysis.  Third,  for  the  existing 
customer maintenance with the part of the improvement, the service which the 
customer desires based on the exact customer information has to be provided.

The big data collects data with the existing database management tool, and means the 
technology  which  extracts  the  value  from  a  large  amount  of  structured  data  or 
exceeding  the  storage,  administration,  and  ability  which  it  can  analyze  unstructured 
data  and  this  data  and  analyze  the  result[2].  If  the  concept  of  the  existing  big  data 
meant that there are just lots of amount of data, the concept of the recent the general 
big  data  is  so  massive  and  means  the  method  or  generally  using  structured  data  or 
unstructured data which is difficult to do the collection, storage, search, analysis and 
visualization  with  the  tool  in  comparison  with  old  data.  The  value  of  the  big  data 
utilization started in the process of has been created the customer-focused value. And 
it  is  considered  as  the  starting  point  of  the  repair  big  data  analysis  handled  in  this 
paper to utilize with the inside organization now. In the component of the big data, the 
feature mentioned in common is 3V(Volume, Velocity, Variety)[3]. However it is the 
tendency that the  concept of the new value is added. According to  the Gartner, data 
complexity is added to common 3V and the big data is illustrated with four concepts. 
In this paper, the big data tries to be embossed on the side of five elements of 4V1C 
including the value to be differentiated from old data. 

If  the  car  maintenance  industry  is  associated  with  the  big  data  and  the  car 
maintenance  record  management  system  can  be  implemented,  the  independently 
performed  customer  management  program  by  maintenance  enterprise  and  database 
will  be  able  to  be  integrated and  it will  be able  to  systematize.  Therefore,  the  effect 
that  it  implements  the  maintenance  record  management  system  which  can  share  the 
maintenance information and which it can utilize efficiently and it improves in order 
to  be  available  in  the  practical  affairs  is  presented.  This  can  be  interpreted  as  the 
dimension of CRM providing the profitable information to the customer through the 
big data analysis[4].

3    Grafting of Car Maintenance Industry   

There are five fields which utilize the big data and create the result differentiated from 
the existing method. The car maintenance area and content that it can combine tries to 
be presented according to each application field[5]. 

First,  the  accuracy  of  the  prediction  is  enhanced  by  the  real-time  prediction  and 
automatic update due to the improvement of the future prediction ability. As to the car 
maintenance, by analyze the pattern of the malfunction symptom which is basis it will 
be  able  to  prevent  from  being  connected  to  the  large-scale  malfunction  previously. 
Second, the new pattern is discovered by the detection of the ducked needs from the 
consumer's  driving  habits  and  the  ducked  needs  is  discovered.  The  automobile 
manufacturers  analyze  the  customer's  driving  habits  and  can  grasp  the  consumer 
needs of the new car. Third, it is the alleviation realization of the risk. The range of 
the  manageable  risk  and  accuracy  will  increase  by  securing  the  qualitative 
information  drastically.  Forth,  it  is  the  personalized  service  offer.  It  differentiates 
according  to the individual customer  and  the useful information not being spam can 
be  provided.  Fifth,  the  real  time  monitoring  of  the  customer  and  management 
condition  and  immediate  correspondence  becomes  possible  with  the  real  time 
countermeasure.  It  watches  and  whether  it  analyze  the  maintenance  breakdown 
information  on  a  real  time  basis  and  the  inappropriate  driving  distance  contrast 
efficient  repair  was  made  or  not  it  informs  immediately  to  the  customer  and  the 
spread of problem will be able to be minimized. 

As a result,  if the big data Curation  is the activity controlling the total process at 
the field of car maintenance till the analysis through the optimization of the big Data 
construction  and  application,  it  can  be  guaranteed  the  more  and  more  stable  service 
and the confidence of the repair culture is built[6]. 

4    Conclusion and Implications 

It is obvious if it what is in the customer relationship management view that we can 
obtain ultimately through the big data analysis of the car maintenance industry. It has 
to become the company object it ducks in data pattern to guess the customer's  mind

customer satisfaction through the big data analysis the improvement plan is same like 
the next. 

First,  the  integrating  database  construction  of  the  auto  repair  shop  customer 
management  program  is  proposed.  The  method  receiving  the  person  customization 
big data service which can be broken away from the danger to the failure through the 
big  data  platform  is  due  to  be  needed.  As  to  this,  the  fault  detection  case-by-case 
analysis  is  useful  from  customer  data  which  the  motorcar  manufacturer  manages. 
However the program share for auto manufacturer the malfunction case analysis is not 
easy.  Therefore,  the  necessity  to  it  integrates  and  manages  data  through  the 
integration of the customer management program of the much the most diffused auto 
repair shop is proposed. The construction of the customer database may be connected 
to the profit enhancement through the customer satisfaction management of the small-
sized auto maintenance service provider.

  Introduction 

At the present time, the reason why the big data rises suddenly as the social concern is 
due to be the tendency that the demand active for the company increases along with 
the improvement of every kind big data software technology analyze data of the huge 
quantity unlike the past. As to the big data, the problem solving consciousness of the 
new  concept  is  needed  based  on  the  thorough  data  analysis.  In  other  words,  the 
company is faced with the problem that it is the new business item excavation through 
the analysis of the big data for the reform and securing future competitiveness. And it 
has to face up to be the point of time to be the preparation breaking this. The company 
maintains  the  business  in  the  continuity  of  the  continuous  decision-making.  In  the 
situation of this decision-making, when being offered the profitable information than 
the experience of the person and intuition through the exquisite presuppose model of 
the optimization plan including the prediction  and simulation, the efficient decision-
making  can  be  taken.  If  the  basic  company  reason  for  being  says  as  the  profit 
maximization through the customer value creation, the application direction of the big 
data should focus on the meaningful information offering for creating the customer. It

data it can create the opportunity of the new business.   

The data analysis is the tendency that the change of recognition that it is the core 
ability  business  controlling  the  company  success  or  failure  is  rapidly  unfolded. 
Afterward, it is expected to settle down as the duty in which the management big data 
analysis  is  important  in  the  management  strategy  overall[1].  In  the  complicated 
competitive  environment,  the  point  that  data  analysis  capability  becomes  the  core 
base  of  the  competition  will  shouldn't  be  disregarded.  Presently,  in  the  car 
maintenance  business  domain,  the  necessity  to  it  presents  conspicuously  what  the 
field of decision-making through the big data analysis is felt. 

In short, it can be said to be the purpose to tries to enhance the accident prevention 
effect by uncovering for the failure part which it can be generated in the near future in 
overflowing  data  through  the  preparatory  signal  of  the  car  trouble  and  will 
introducing  to  the  operator  in  advance.  Since  this  research  considers  the  big  data 
utilization possible area in the viewpoint of consumer in order to seek the grafting in 
the various field the real big data environment and car maintenance industry coming 
to the front it tries to present the practical implication. 

2    Literature Review 

The big data collects data with the existing database management tool, and means the 
technology  which  extracts  the  value  from  a  large  amount  of  structured  data  or 
exceeding  the  storage,  administration,  and  ability  which  it  can  analyze  unstructured 
data  and  this  data  and  analyze  the  result[2].  If  the  concept  of  the  existing  big  data 
meant that there are just lots of amount of data, the concept of the recent the general 
big  data  is  so  massive  and  means  the  method  or  generally  using  structured  data  or 
unstructured data which is difficult to do the collection, storage, search, analysis and 
visualization  with  the  tool  in  comparison  with  old  data.  The  value  of  the  big  data 
utilization started in the process of has been created the customer-focused value. And 
it  is  considered  as  the  starting  point  of  the  repair  big  data  analysis  handled  in  this 
paper to utilize with the inside organization now. In the component of the big data, the 
feature mentioned in common is 3V(Volume, Velocity, Variety)[3]. However it is the 
tendency that the  concept of the new value is added. According to  the Gartner, data 
complexity is added to common 3V and the big data is illustrated with four concepts. 
In this paper, the big data tries to be embossed on the side of five elements of 4V1C 
including the value to be differentiated from old data. 

If  the  car  maintenance  industry  is  associated  with  the  big  data  and  the  car 
maintenance  record  management  system  can  be  implemented,  the  independently 
performed  customer  management  program  by  maintenance  enterprise  and  database 
will  be  able  to  be  integrated and  it will  be able  to  systematize.  Therefore,  the  effect 
that  it  implements  the  maintenance  record  management  system  which  can  share  the 
maintenance information and which it can utilize efficiently and it improves in order 
to  be  available  in  the  practical  affairs  is  presented.  This  can  be  interpreted  as  the 
dimension of CRM providing the profitable information to the customer through the 
big data analysis[4]. 

Advanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.84 (Business 2015)94Copyright © 2015 SERSCThe device for including all information of the car is ECU. In ECU, all information 
of  the  detail  including  the  automotive  engine,  transmission,  ABS  and  airbag  are 
included. Basic data which can check vehicle all sensor conditions and determine the 
abnormality are provided.   

The  diagnostic  equipment  grasping  this  all  detailed  information  is  the  electric 
diagnostic  system.  The  diagnostic  system  comparing the definition value of all sorts 
of sensor with numeric data of the current state, the abnormality is determined. Since 
as the car capability is advanced, the attachment of many sensors is essential and the 
tens  kinds  of  sensors  perform  each  role  satisfactorily  the  safe  driving  is  mortgaged. 
The degradation of each sensor become the main cause of the car trouble among the 
causes for many malfunctions.   

3    Grafting of Car Maintenance Industry   

There are five fields which utilize the big data and create the result differentiated from 
the existing method. The car maintenance area and content that it can combine tries to 
be presented according to each application field[5]. 

First,  the  accuracy  of  the  prediction  is  enhanced  by  the  real-time  prediction  and 
automatic update due to the improvement of the future prediction ability. As to the car 
maintenance, by analyze the pattern of the malfunction symptom which is basis it will 
be  able  to  prevent  from  being  connected  to  the  large-scale  malfunction  previously. 
Second, the new pattern is discovered by the detection of the ducked needs from the 
consumer's  driving  habits  and  the  ducked  needs  is  discovered.  The  automobile 
manufacturers  analyze  the  customer's  driving  habits  and  can  grasp  the  consumer 
needs of the new car. Third, it is the alleviation realization of the risk. The range of 
the  manageable  risk  and  accuracy  will  increase  by  securing  the  qualitative 
information  drastically.  Forth,  it  is  the  personalized  service  offer.  It  differentiates 
according  to the individual customer  and  the useful information not being spam can 
be  provided.  Fifth,  the  real  time  monitoring  of  the  customer  and  management 
condition  and  immediate  correspondence  becomes  possible  with  the  real  time 
countermeasure.  It  watches  and  whether  it  analyze  the  maintenance  breakdown 
information  on  a  real  time  basis  and  the  inappropriate  driving  distance  contrast 
efficient  repair  was  made  or  not  it  informs  immediately  to  the  customer  and  the 
spread of problem will be able to be minimized. 

As a result,  if the big data Curation  is the activity controlling the total process at 
the field of car maintenance till the analysis through the optimization of the big Data 
construction  and  application,  it  can  be  guaranteed  the  more  and  more  stable  service 
and the confidence of the repair culture is built[6]. 

4    Conclusion and Implications 

It is obvious if it what is in the customer relationship management view that we can 
obtain ultimately through the big data analysis of the car maintenance industry. It has 
to become the company object it ducks in data pattern to guess the customer's  mind 

Advanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.84 (Business 2015)Copyright © 2015 SERSC95and grasp the needs of the ultimate customer and itemize the business. Concretely, the 
customer satisfaction through the big data analysis the improvement plan is same like 
the next. 

First,  the  integrating  database  construction  of  the  auto  repair  shop  customer 
management  program  is  proposed.  The  method  receiving  the  person  customization 
big data service which can be broken away from the danger to the failure through the 
big  data  platform  is  due  to  be  needed.  As  to  this,  the  fault  detection  case-by-case 
analysis  is  useful  from  customer  data  which  the  motorcar  manufacturer  manages. 
However the program share for auto manufacturer the malfunction case analysis is not 
easy.  Therefore,  the  necessity  to  it  integrates  and  manages  data  through  the 
integration of the customer management program of the much the most diffused auto 
repair shop is proposed. The construction of the customer database may be connected 
to the profit enhancement through the customer satisfaction management of the small-
sized auto maintenance service provider.

Second, the person cloud computing system connected with the Smart phone to the 
method that customer can confirm the real-time analysis data that is the advantage of 
the big data analysis is proposed. It will be delivered the diagnostic system that is the 
equipment for distinguishing vehicle trouble whether or not and failure part through 
the vehicle ECU. The system construction which vehicle failure part and abnormality 
is  transmittable  through  the  quantified  data  analysis  of  the  diagnostic  system  to  the 
operator  on  a  real  time  basis  will  be  urgently  needed.  In  case  of  operating  the 
repairing system of the web based with through each maker and repair coalition and 
operating the separate diagnostic system analysis becomes available. The construction 

Advanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.84 (Business 2015)96Copyright © 2015 SERSCof the individual cloud computing system which determines the relative importance of 
the fault detection and deliver realize the urgent repair or no to the operator on a real 
time, so this might make basis of the safe driving. The system construction which will 
notify  failure  part  statistical  data  for  each  driving  distance  to  the  customer  from  the 
integrated database in advance or which previously it can manage with the preventive 
maintenance  through  the  alerting  service  through  the  Smart  phone  will  be  needed. 
Because  the  profitable  information  which  is  needed  to  the  individual  customer  can 
present the exact statistics about the case by malfunction of the past same car mode, 
the big data analysis should become the basis. 

Third, for the existing customer maintenance with the part of the improvement, the 
service which the customer desires based on the exact customer information has to be 
provided. The requirement in the car repair job will need the system in which directly 
the  customer  can  inquire  into  the  thorough maintenance  record  administration  along 
with  the  maintenance  fee  which  is  clear  than  what  at  the  point  of  time  when  the 
change  to  is needed it has  to provide  the reliability to  the customer.  As a result,  the 
customer database is accumulated and it utilize actively for the customer to be wanted 
maintenance record inquiry and malfunction case causal analysis.
