Abstract. With wireless communication and smart apparatuses, people now can 
create,  share,  and  consume  information  at  anytime  and  anywhere.  In  addition, 
development  of  technology  has  allowed  the  large-scale  data  of  image,  voice, 
and image to be spreaded and shared, from the existing data consumption pat-
tern of users that was mainly consisted of the text. With this, the quantity of da-
ta to be consumed by individual has been geometrically increased. At last, the 
age of Big Data has been emerged. The big data existing in the life have includ-
ed a vast information. Now, analysis and utilization of these data in what kind 
of  aspect  has  been  more  important.  In  this  study,  the  status  of  Big  Data  have 
been looked through and the method of its utilization in the global online busi-
ness field has been suggested.

2.1 Concept of Big Data 

Definition of Big Data has started in the size of data and in the technological aspect, 
while There has been actually not yet agreement with specific and quantitative defini-
tion for Big Data, and there is a trend that its meaning has been expanded to values of 
Big  Data  and  effect  of  its  utilization.[3]  IDC  defines  Big  Data  as  “A  designed  next 
generation technology and architecture to allow to extract the economically necessary 
values trough high-speed capture, search for data and analysis from the vast volume of 
data  consisted  of  various  data”[4],  and  Gartner  defines  it  as  “It  means  that  the  large 
volume of data are streaming in real time as consistent and various types[5]”. In addi-
tion, McKinsey defines it as “a large scale of data as much as difficult  in  collection, 
save, management, and analysis with the traditional database software”[6]

tion, McKinsey defines it as “a large scale of data as much as difficult  in  collection, 
save, management, and analysis with the traditional database software”[6] 

 

2.2 Characteristics of Big Data 

Big  Data  has  3  representative  characteristics:  more  than  PB-class  gigantic  data  vol-
ume,  data  variety  including  non-structured  data,  and  data  velocity  generated  in  real 
time.  In  addition,  four  types  of  characteristics  have  been  mentioned,  including  com-
plexity of environment for utilization of data.  

3  Concept & Status of U-Trade Hub 

3.1 Concept of U-Trade Hub 

U-Trade  means  doing  business  and  sharing  information  anytime,  anywhere  using 
mobile,  PDA  ,  broadband  wireless  network  and  wireless  mobile  network[7],  and  U-
Trade Hub allows to provide a single window that can deal with all kinds of  trading 
business  process  without  any  rupture  from  market  survey  to  contract,  commercial 
trading,  foreign  exchange,  custom  clearance,  logistics,  and  payment,  to  the  trading 
company by using the high-end IT apparatuses[8].  

U-Trade Hub is an integrated system environment to deal with the key factors for 
providing a single window as the systematic and integrated single business. With the 
integrated system where various and comprehensive matters have been systematically 
integrated,  including  electric  trading  documents,  such  as  contract,  payment,  and 
judgement of responsibility among various trading subjects, the trading company can 
deal with the business without any limit to time and space. 

3.2 Status of U-Trade Hub  

In  the  status  of  using  U-Trade  Hub,  the  number  of  memberships  has  been  rapidly 
increased by 33,413 people from 51,122 people in 2011 to 17,709 people in 2010, and 
this is attributed to the fact that application and issuance of the purchase confirmation 
is  obliged  to  be  dealt  with  only  on-line  through  U-Trade  Hub  from  2011.  07.11.  In 
addition, it has been increased to 59,263 companies on  Dec., 2012. 

4  Proposal for System 

Big  data  can  be  utilized  in  the  various  industrial  fields  according  to  collection  and 
analysis of information. McKinsey has introduced effect and examples of utilizing Big 
Data  for  each  5  field,  such  as  medical,  retail,  manufacture,  GPS  information,  and 
public  service,  and  IBM  has  increased  productivity  and  efficiency  by  applying  Big 
Data to the entire industrial fields through campaign.

4  Proposal for System 

Big  data  can  be  utilized  in  the  various  industrial  fields  according  to  collection  and

Data  for  each  5  field,  such  as  medical,  retail,  manufacture,  GPS  information,  and 
public  service,  and  IBM  has  increased  productivity  and  efficiency  by  applying  Big 
Data to the entire industrial fields through campaign. 

With utilizing Big Data, the following system model is proposed to solve the prob-
lems of the electric trading integration system and reinforce the  function as the single 
window.  

 

Fig. 2. Single Window System 

After analyzing the Big Data related the electric trading  and  trade  to  be  variously 
collected through various analysis technique, the professional information is forward-
ed  to  each  detail  system  by  classifying  with  information  appropriate  for  each  sub-
system  of  U-Trade  Hub  with  arrangement  of  information  through  a  consistent  and 
standardized  rules.  Through  a  series  of  process,  various  information  is  though  the 
collecting, arranging, classifying procedures and systemized. This systematized infor-
mation is utilized as the detail information for the system integration and service more 
efficient  than  in  each  specialized  sub-system.  In  addition,  the  range  of  the  system 
integration  can  be  expanded  to  worldwide  through  sharing  data  with  global  web  site 
and searching site.  

5  Conclusions 

Development of IT technology and wireless communication technology has caused the 
flow of the gigantic information data and the situation that analysis and classification 
of  information  are  more  important  than  production  and  collection.  Development  of 
new Big Data analysis technique will bring innovation in various  fields  utilizing  Big 
Data, and suggest the way to deal with the vast volume of information that could not 
be dealt with so far. Big Data is a new paradigm throughout the entire industrial fields.  
In this study, the Big Data, represented as non-structured, diversification, fast data 
generation, and complexity, has been intended to be analyzed and utilized with focus 
on  the  part  ,  increase  of  efficiency  of  the  system  and  integration  of  electric  trading 
system.
