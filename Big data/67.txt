ABSTRACT 
Spurred  by  evidence  that  students’  future  studies  are  highly 
influenced  during  middle  school,  recent  efforts  have  seen  a 
growing  emphasis  on  introducing  computer  science  to  middle 
school 
in-progress 
development  of  a  new  middle  school  curricular  module  for  Big 
Data, situated as part of a new CS Principles-based middle school 
curriculum.  Big  Data  is  of  widespread  societal  importance  and 
holds increasing implications for the computer science workforce. 
It also has appeal as a focus for middle school computer science 
because  of  its  rich  interplay  with  other  important  computer 
science principles. This paper examines three key aspects of a Big 
Data  unit  for  middle  school:  its  alignment  with  emerging 
curricular standards; the perspectives of middle school classroom 
teachers in mathematics, science, and language arts; and student 
feedback  as  explored  during  a  middle  school  pilot  study  with  a 
small subset of the planned curriculum. The results indicate that a 
Big  Data  unit  holds  great  promise  as  part  of  a  middle  school 
computer science curriculum.

positive  experience  with  a  subject  matter  plays  a  pivotal  role 
[2, 12].  This  point  has  particular  significance  within  the  field  of 
computer  science;  for  example,  a  very  small  number  of  US 
students take the traditional AP CS exam, and there is a troubling 
participation  gap  seen  in  that  small  body  of  test-takers  [2].  The 
discrepancy  corresponds  to  similarly  disappointing  statistics  for 
students who earn bachelor degrees in computer science [29]. 
In  both  their  stated  aspirations  and  in  their  development  of 
subject-specific  skills,  students  begin  their  career  trajectory  in 
middle  school  [14].  Researchers  have  specifically  traced  the 
underproduction and underrepresentation issues in undergraduate 
computer science departments back to lack of exposure as early as 
middle school [22, 26]. In the U.S., any middle school computer 
science  intervention  must  address  the  challenge  that  computer 
science  is  essentially  absent  from  standard  public  education 
curricula. Numerous successful middle school interventions have 
addressed 
through  after-school,  summer,  or 
enrichment-based activities; for example, these curricula often use 
various  visual  programming  languages  [15]  or  computer  games 
[25].  Yet  important  questions  remain  for  a  computer  science 
curriculum  designed  for  in-class  settings.  How  can  computer 
science  learning  objectives  be  aligned  with  new  curricular 
standards?  How  can  computer  science  be  successfully  delivered 
by  teachers  who  are  trained  in other  subjects? And  finally,  how 
can  we  build  learning  activities  that  are  highly  engaging  and 
developmentally appropriate for students? 
This paper examines these questions in the context of a proposed 
curricular unit for Big Data, one of the foci of the proposed AP 
Computer  Science  Principles  course  [7].  Although  a  full  formal 
definition  of  “Big  Data”  is  still  emerging,  the  phenomenon  is 
often  characterized  by  collection  at  high  velocity,  storage  in  a 
variety  of  structures,  and  large  volume  [8].  In  addition  to  its 
widespread  societal  importance  and  increasing  implications  for 
the computer science workforce, Big Data holds great promise as 
a  focus  for  middle  school  computer  science  because  of  its  rich 
interplay with other important CS Principles including algorithms, 
abstraction,  and  the  Internet.  As  this  paper  describes,  Big  Data 
also  represents  an  area  with  strong  correspondence  between  CS 
Principles and emerging US national curricular standards such as 
the  Common  Core  in  Mathematics  [5]  and  the  Next  Generation

incorporating  other  highly  engaging  application  domains, 
including  those  that  are  relevant  to  kids’  everyday  lives.  For 
instance,  an  excellent  example  of  Big  Data  can  be  seen  within 
social  networks  and  their  massive  collections  of  structured  and 
unstructured data.  
The work reported here is conducted in the context of the ENGAGE 
project, a multi-year effort that will see development of a full CS 
Principles-based  middle  school  curriculum  situated  within  a 
game-based  learning  environment.  The  CS  Principles  approach 
may  be  well  suited  for  the  middle  school  level  because  the 
thematic threads of CS Principles Big Ideas can be introduced at a 
developmentally appropriate level for middle school students and 
thus provide the basis for more advanced work in high school. We 
are  developing  our  curriculum  in  an  iterative  fashion  with  pilot 
studies  and  focus  groups  on  each  set  of  prototype  learning 
activities.  This  paper  presents  the  work  to  date  on  the  Big  Data 
curricular  unit, including  its alignment  with emerging  standards, 
feedback from an interdisciplinary group of teachers, and results 
from a pilot study with middle school students. While the piloted 
activity represents only a small subset of the planned curriculum 
for  ENGAGE,  results  suggest  that  Big  Data  holds  appeal  for 
achieving  computer  science  learning  and  for  showcasing  the 
relevance of computer science to middle school students. 
2.  RELATED WORK 
Recent  years  have  seen  an  increase  in  the  number  of  middle 
school computing interventions, many of which innovate to teach 
programming  with  visual  or  graphical  programming  languages. 
Alice 3D has been used successfully [21], integrating computing 
within  the  context  of  a  wide  variety  of  subjects  such  as  math, 
science, and  language arts  [20],  and  to  help  students  understand 
what  their  future  careers  in  computing  might  look  like  [27]. 
Scratch programming has also been used extensively [4, 15, 23], 
including with students with disabilities [1], urban youth [16], or 
particular underrepresented groups [10]. Other languages such as 
Logo  [15]  and  more  recently  Kodu  [24]  have  also  been  used  in 
middle school interventions. There is also growing momentum for 
using game design and game programming [25] and robotics [13] 
as ways to introduce computer science to middle school students. 
Efforts  have  also  been  made 
to  formalize  assessment  of 
computational thinking at the middle school level [28]. 
In  complement  to  this  middle  school  work,  the  AP  Computer 
Science  Principles  course  is  being  developed  at  the  high  school 
level and plans to debut as an official, credit-bearing course in the 
2016-17  academic  year  [7].  CS  Principles  is  organized  around 
seven Big Ideas, one of which is Big Data. Students must analyze, 
interpret, and gain new insight from data sets, both visually and 
statistically [7]. Relatedly, Berkeley’s CS Principles pilot course, 
"The Beauty and Joy of Computing" has sections on the impact of 
Big  Data  and  information  technology  in  modern  life  [11]. 
Notably, this aspect of social relevance is a motivating factor for 
women to enter and remain in computer science [9]. Our current 
work takes inspiration from these CS Principles pilots, in concert 
with  teacher  and  student  focus  group  feedback,  in  developing  a 
Big Data curricular unit. 
3.  BIG DATA CURRICULUM DESIGN 
An important focus of our ongoing work is to develop a suite of 
learning activities that can be adopted within a variety of middle 
school contexts including standalone computer science courses or 
as enrichment for subject matter areas including mathematics and 
science.  A  vital  step  toward  this  goal  is  aligning  the  CS 
Principles-based  curriculum  with  current  standards  for  middle

Standards for English and Mathematics, and the Next Generation 
Science  Standards,  and  then  conducted  teacher  focus  groups  to 
gain  feedback  on  this  alignment  and  to  help  tailor  the  proposed 
Big Data curriculum to middle school classrooms. 
3.1  Alignment with Curricular Standards 
3.1.1  Common Core State Standards 
Beginning in 2009, the Common Core State Standards Initiative 
created  a  set  of  curricular  standards  intended  to  align  the 
previously separate curricula of individual states within the U.S. 
According to its mission statement, these standards, “are designed 
to  be  robust  and  relevant  to  the  real  world,  reflecting  the 
knowledge  and  skills  that  our  young  people  need  for  success  in 
college and careers” [5]. Common Core for Mathematics laid out 
a  series  of  high-level  practices  through  which  students  are 
expected 
in  problems,  use  abstract  and 
quantitative reasoning, construct arguments, critique the reasoning 
of  others,  and  model  with  mathematics.  Similarly,  the  CS 
Principles  curriculum  frames  seven  Big  Ideas  around  the  core 
computational 
thinking  practices  of  connecting  computing, 
developing  computational  artifacts,  abstracting,  analyzing 
problems  and  artifacts,  communicating,  and  collaborating  [7]. 
Table  1  highlights  some  important  parallels  between  the  CS 
Principles  Computational  Thinking  (CT)  Practices  and 
the 
practices for the Common Core in Mathematics.  
At a high level, both CS Principles and the Common Core include 
big ideas on data. While the Common Core standards relating to 
data do not map directly to the corresponding CS Principles Big 
Idea, we see the opportunity for a curriculum that serves the goals 
of both CS Principles and the Common Core in a complementary 
fashion. Table 2 shows Learning Objectives for CS Principles and 
selected standards from the Common Core that relate to data. 

to  find  meaning 

 

3.1.2  The Next Generation Science Standards 
Similar to the Common Core, the precursor Framework report and 
Next Generation Science Standards in the U.S. [17, 18] does not 
explicitly  address  computer  science,  but  holds  promise  for  the 
development of complementary curricula. The Framework report 
states  that  elements  of  both  computational  and  mathematical

level and plans to debut as an official, credit-bearing course in the

seven Big Ideas, one of which is Big Data. Students must analyze, 
interpret, and gain new insight from data sets, both visually and 
statistically [7]. Relatedly, Berkeley’s CS Principles pilot course,

Big  Data  and  information  technology  in  modern  life  [11].

Big Data curricular unit.

An important focus of our ongoing work is to develop a suite of 
learning activities that can be adopted within a variety of middle

gain  feedback  on  this  alignment  and  to  help  tailor  the  proposed 
Big Data curriculum to middle school classrooms. 
3.1  Alignment with Curricular Standards 
3.1.1  Common Core State Standards 
Beginning in 2009, the Common Core State Standards Initiative 
created  a  set  of  curricular  standards  intended  to  align  the 
previously separate curricula of individual states within the U.S. 
According to its mission statement, these standards, “are designed 
to  be  robust  and  relevant  to  the  real  world,  reflecting  the 
knowledge  and  skills  that  our  young  people  need  for  success  in 
college and careers” [5]. Common Core for Mathematics laid out 
a  series  of  high-level  practices  through  which  students  are 
expected 
in  problems,  use  abstract  and 
quantitative reasoning, construct arguments, critique the reasoning 
of  others,  and  model  with  mathematics.  Similarly,  the  CS 
Principles  curriculum  frames  seven  Big  Ideas  around  the  core 
computational 
thinking  practices  of  connecting  computing, 
developing  computational  artifacts,  abstracting,  analyzing 
problems  and  artifacts,  communicating,  and  collaborating  [7]. 
Table  1  highlights  some  important  parallels  between  the  CS 
Principles  Computational  Thinking  (CT)  Practices  and 
the 
practices for the Common Core in Mathematics.  
At a high level, both CS Principles and the Common Core include 
big ideas on data. While the Common Core standards relating to 
data do not map directly to the corresponding CS Principles Big 
Idea, we see the opportunity for a curriculum that serves the goals 
of both CS Principles and the Common Core in a complementary 
fashion. Table 2 shows Learning Objectives for CS Principles and 
selected standards from the Common Core that relate to data.

development of complementary curricula. The Framework report

engineering  practices  recognize  the  importance  of  identifying 
student  outcomes  that  go  beyond  memorizing  narrowly  focused

data” [18]. As this statement illustrates, there is great promise for 
creating  curricula  in  which  the  power  of  computer  science  is 
illustrated within the context of widely required subject matter.

3.2  Teacher Focus Groups 
With  this  alignment  in  hand  between  the  proposed  Big  Data 
concepts  and  standard  curricula,  the  next  step  was  to  obtain 
detailed  feedback  from  experienced  middle  school  teachers  to 
inform the development of specific learning activities. We held a 
series  of  in-depth  classroom  teacher  focus  groups  during  the 
summer of 2013. Three teachers from an urban middle school in 
Raleigh,  North  Carolina  were  recruited 
to  participate  for 
approximately 40 hours each in both group and solo sessions. The 
teachers were two females and one male, and all three were from 
minority  groups  that  are  underrepresented  in  computer  science. 
They included one 8th grade math teacher, one 7th grade science 
teacher, and one 7th grade language arts teacher. Each focus group 
session lasted between three and four hours and the format varied 
depending  on  the  topic.  Early  sessions  focused  on  introducing 
computer science topics to the teachers. These sessions involved 
both  presentations  and  guided classroom  activities  conducted  by 
project 
team  members.  Later  focus  groups  were  heavily 
discussion-based,  as  teachers  brainstormed  on  how  to  teach 
computer  science  principles  to  middle  school  students,  and 
drafting classroom activities.  
3.2.1  8th Grade Math 
The 8th grade math teacher expressed some initial hesitation to the 
idea  of  teaching  Big  Data  to  middle  school  students,  concerned 
that  its  concepts  would  be  out  of  reach  given  the  students’ 
development level. However, she became much more receptive to 
the idea after a more thorough discussion and explanation of Big 
Data.  She  emphasized  the  need  to  introduce  topics  in  “baby 
steps.” She noted that middle school students are still developing 
the  mathematical  background  to  perform  statistical  computation. 
A question she raised was, “To what degree and depth do we want 
them to understand Big Data…and have it support the Common 
Core?” Another of her primary concerns was, “How do we do it in 
a way that is not overwhelming to them…and that they say ‘Wow, 
cool.  How  can  I  use  this  in  my  life  today?’”  The  other  two 
teachers  echoed  this  sentiment,  emphasizing  that  the  curriculum 
should be grounded in human applications to which students can 
personally relate. As will be described in Section 4, our iterative 
curriculum development process involves measuring the extent to 
which students relate to each prototype learning activity. 
3.2.2  7th Grade Science 
The  science  teacher  provided  insight  into  how  to  create  middle 
school  activities  that  support  what  students  are  learning  in  their 
science  classes.  In  particular,  she  emphasized  that  we  should 
reinforce  the  scientific  method,  which  all  students  in  grades  six 
through  eight  have  learned and  use  in  their  science  classes.  She 
also noted that reading tables and graphs is difficult in general for 
students,  but  is  an  important  skill  for  them  to  learn.  Making 
inferences  or  forecasting  from  data  is  particularly  difficult  for 
middle school students, so she suggested ways to slowly introduce 
the  material  over 
to  avoid  overly  abstract 
representations.  This  advice  guided  the  scaffolding  included 
within the first Big Data activity, described in Section 4.  
3.2.3  7th Grade Language Arts 
The 7th grade language arts teacher quickly saw implications for 
his  classroom.  For  instance,  he  uses  Wordle1  to  generate  “word 
clouds” from texts before his class reads a book. As a class, they 
use the most prevalent words to make predictions on the dominant 
themes that might appear in the book. After the lesson on “What

ABSTRACT 
Spurred  by  evidence  that  students’  future  studies  are  highly 
influenced  during  middle  school,  recent  efforts  have  seen  a 
growing  emphasis  on  introducing  computer  science  to  middle 
school 
in-progress 
development  of  a  new  middle  school  curricular  module  for  Big 
Data, situated as part of a new CS Principles-based middle school 
curriculum.  Big  Data  is  of  widespread  societal  importance  and 
holds increasing implications for the computer science workforce. 
It also has appeal as a focus for middle school computer science 
because  of  its  rich  interplay  with  other  important  computer 
science principles. This paper examines three key aspects of a Big 
Data  unit  for  middle  school:  its  alignment  with  emerging 
curricular standards; the perspectives of middle school classroom 
teachers in mathematics, science, and language arts; and student 
feedback  as  explored  during  a  middle  school  pilot  study  with  a 
small subset of the planned curriculum. The results indicate that a 
Big  Data  unit  holds  great  promise  as  part  of  a  middle  school 
computer science curriculum.

this  challenge 

choose  and  succeed  with  an  undergraduate  major:  previous 
positive  experience  with  a  subject  matter  plays  a  pivotal  role 
[2, 12].  This  point  has  particular  significance  within  the  field  of 
computer  science;  for  example,  a  very  small  number  of  US 
students take the traditional AP CS exam, and there is a troubling 
participation  gap  seen  in  that  small  body  of  test-takers  [2].  The 
discrepancy  corresponds  to  similarly  disappointing  statistics  for 
students who earn bachelor degrees in computer science [29]. 
In  both  their  stated  aspirations  and  in  their  development  of 
subject-specific  skills,  students  begin  their  career  trajectory  in 
middle  school  [14].  Researchers  have  specifically  traced  the 
underproduction and underrepresentation issues in undergraduate 
computer science departments back to lack of exposure as early as 
middle school [22, 26]. In the U.S., any middle school computer 
science  intervention  must  address  the  challenge  that  computer 
science  is  essentially  absent  from  standard  public  education 
curricula. Numerous successful middle school interventions have 
addressed 
through  after-school,  summer,  or 
enrichment-based activities; for example, these curricula often use 
various  visual  programming  languages  [15]  or  computer  games 
[25].  Yet  important  questions  remain  for  a  computer  science 
curriculum  designed  for  in-class  settings.  How  can  computer 
science  learning  objectives  be  aligned  with  new  curricular 
standards?  How  can  computer  science  be  successfully  delivered 
by  teachers  who  are  trained  in other  subjects? And  finally,  how 
can  we  build  learning  activities  that  are  highly  engaging  and 
developmentally appropriate for students? 
This paper examines these questions in the context of a proposed 
curricular unit for Big Data, one of the foci of the proposed AP 
Computer  Science  Principles  course  [7].  Although  a  full  formal 
definition  of  “Big  Data”  is  still  emerging,  the  phenomenon  is 
often  characterized  by  collection  at  high  velocity,  storage  in  a 
variety  of  structures,  and  large  volume  [8].  In  addition  to  its 
widespread  societal  importance  and  increasing  implications  for 
the computer science workforce, Big Data holds great promise as 
a  focus  for  middle  school  computer  science  because  of  its  rich 
interplay with other important CS Principles including algorithms, 
abstraction,  and  the  Internet.  As  this  paper  describes,  Big  Data 
also  represents  an  area  with  strong  correspondence  between  CS 
Principles and emerging US national curricular standards such as 
the  Common  Core  in  Mathematics  [5]  and  the  Next  Generation 
Science Standards [17, 18]. In addition to its strong links to other 
core  subjects,  the  topic  of  Big  Data  has  great  flexibility  in 

 

incorporating  other  highly  engaging  application  domains, 
including  those  that  are  relevant  to  kids’  everyday  lives.  For 
instance,  an  excellent  example  of  Big  Data  can  be  seen  within 
social  networks  and  their  massive  collections  of  structured  and 
unstructured data.  
The work reported here is conducted in the context of the ENGAGE 
project, a multi-year effort that will see development of a full CS 
Principles-based  middle  school  curriculum  situated  within  a 
game-based  learning  environment.  The  CS  Principles  approach 
may  be  well  suited  for  the  middle  school  level  because  the 
thematic threads of CS Principles Big Ideas can be introduced at a 
developmentally appropriate level for middle school students and 
thus provide the basis for more advanced work in high school. We 
are  developing  our  curriculum  in  an  iterative  fashion  with  pilot 
studies  and  focus  groups  on  each  set  of  prototype  learning 
activities.  This  paper  presents  the  work  to  date  on  the  Big  Data 
curricular  unit, including  its alignment  with emerging  standards, 
feedback from an interdisciplinary group of teachers, and results 
from a pilot study with middle school students. While the piloted 
activity represents only a small subset of the planned curriculum 
for  ENGAGE,  results  suggest  that  Big  Data  holds  appeal  for 
achieving  computer  science  learning  and  for  showcasing  the 
relevance of computer science to middle school students. 
2.  RELATED WORK 
Recent  years  have  seen  an  increase  in  the  number  of  middle 
school computing interventions, many of which innovate to teach 
programming  with  visual  or  graphical  programming  languages. 
Alice 3D has been used successfully [21], integrating computing 
within  the  context  of  a  wide  variety  of  subjects  such  as  math, 
science, and  language arts  [20],  and  to  help  students  understand 
what  their  future  careers  in  computing  might  look  like  [27]. 
Scratch programming has also been used extensively [4, 15, 23], 
including with students with disabilities [1], urban youth [16], or 
particular underrepresented groups [10]. Other languages such as 
Logo  [15]  and  more  recently  Kodu  [24]  have  also  been  used  in 
middle school interventions. There is also growing momentum for 
using game design and game programming [25] and robotics [13] 
as ways to introduce computer science to middle school students. 
Efforts  have  also  been  made 
to  formalize  assessment  of 
computational thinking at the middle school level [28]. 
In  complement  to  this  middle  school  work,  the  AP  Computer 
Science  Principles  course  is  being  developed  at  the  high  school 
level and plans to debut as an official, credit-bearing course in the 
2016-17  academic  year  [7].  CS  Principles  is  organized  around 
seven Big Ideas, one of which is Big Data. Students must analyze, 
interpret, and gain new insight from data sets, both visually and 
statistically [7]. Relatedly, Berkeley’s CS Principles pilot course, 
"The Beauty and Joy of Computing" has sections on the impact of 
Big  Data  and  information  technology  in  modern  life  [11]. 
Notably, this aspect of social relevance is a motivating factor for 
women to enter and remain in computer science [9]. Our current 
work takes inspiration from these CS Principles pilots, in concert 
with  teacher  and  student  focus  group  feedback,  in  developing  a 
Big Data curricular unit. 
3.  BIG DATA CURRICULUM DESIGN 
An important focus of our ongoing work is to develop a suite of 
learning activities that can be adopted within a variety of middle 
school contexts including standalone computer science courses or 
as enrichment for subject matter areas including mathematics and 
science.  A  vital  step  toward  this  goal  is  aligning  the  CS 
Principles-based  curriculum  with  current  standards  for  middle

3.1  Alignment with Curricular Standards 
3.1.1  Common Core State Standards 
Beginning in 2009, the Common Core State Standards Initiative 
created  a  set  of  curricular  standards  intended  to  align  the 
previously separate curricula of individual states within the U.S. 
According to its mission statement, these standards, “are designed 
to  be  robust  and  relevant  to  the  real  world,  reflecting  the 
knowledge  and  skills  that  our  young  people  need  for  success  in 
college and careers” [5]. Common Core for Mathematics laid out 
a  series  of  high-level  practices  through  which  students  are 
expected 
in  problems,  use  abstract  and 
quantitative reasoning, construct arguments, critique the reasoning 
of  others,  and  model  with  mathematics.  Similarly,  the  CS 
Principles  curriculum  frames  seven  Big  Ideas  around  the  core 
computational 
thinking  practices  of  connecting  computing, 
developing  computational  artifacts,  abstracting,  analyzing 
problems  and  artifacts,  communicating,  and  collaborating  [7]. 
Table  1  highlights  some  important  parallels  between  the  CS 
Principles  Computational  Thinking  (CT)  Practices  and 
the 
practices for the Common Core in Mathematics.  
At a high level, both CS Principles and the Common Core include 
big ideas on data. While the Common Core standards relating to 
data do not map directly to the corresponding CS Principles Big 
Idea, we see the opportunity for a curriculum that serves the goals 
of both CS Principles and the Common Core in a complementary 
fashion. Table 2 shows Learning Objectives for CS Principles and

computer  science  principles  to  middle  school  students,  and 
drafting classroom activities.  
3.2.1  8th Grade Math 
The 8th grade math teacher expressed some initial hesitation to the 
idea  of  teaching  Big  Data  to  middle  school  students,  concerned 
that  its  concepts  would  be  out  of  reach  given  the  students’ 
development level. However, she became much more receptive to 
the idea after a more thorough discussion and explanation of Big 
Data.  She  emphasized  the  need  to  introduce  topics  in  “baby 
steps.” She noted that middle school students are still developing 
the  mathematical  background  to  perform  statistical  computation. 
A question she raised was, “To what degree and depth do we want 
them to understand Big Data…and have it support the Common 
Core?” Another of her primary concerns was, “How do we do it in 
a way that is not overwhelming to them…and that they say ‘Wow, 
cool.  How  can  I  use  this  in  my  life  today?’”  The  other  two 
teachers  echoed  this  sentiment,  emphasizing  that  the  curriculum 
should be grounded in human applications to which students can 
personally relate. As will be described in Section 4, our iterative 
curriculum development process involves measuring the extent to 
which students relate to each prototype learning activity. 
3.2.2  7th Grade Science 
The  science  teacher  provided  insight  into  how  to  create  middle 
school  activities  that  support  what  students  are  learning  in  their 
science  classes.  In  particular,  she  emphasized  that  we  should 
reinforce  the  scientific  method,  which  all  students  in  grades  six 
through  eight  have  learned and  use  in  their  science  classes.  She 
also noted that reading tables and graphs is difficult in general for 
students,  but  is  an  important  skill  for  them  to  learn.  Making 
inferences  or  forecasting  from  data  is  particularly  difficult  for 
middle school students, so she suggested ways to slowly introduce 
the  material  over 
to  avoid  overly  abstract 
representations.  This  advice  guided  the  scaffolding  included 
within the first Big Data activity, described in Section 4.  
3.2.3  7th Grade Language Arts 
The 7th grade language arts teacher quickly saw implications for 
his  classroom.  For  instance,  he  uses  Wordle1  to  generate  “word 
clouds” from texts before his class reads a book. As a class, they 
use the most prevalent words to make predictions on the dominant 
themes that might appear in the book. After the lesson on “What

time,  and 

 

is Big Data”, the teacher saw this activity as a good opportunity to 
broaden the discussion in his classroom to include Big Data. Also 
certified as a social studies teacher, he drew a parallel between a 
challenge 
that  middle  school  students  might  have  with 
programming and one they have in social studies: “sequencing is a 
difficulty for kids.” He noted that middle school students struggle 
to  make  the  connection  from  past  to  present,  from  present  to 
future,  and  from  self  to  global  community.  Our  team  aims  to 
address  some  of  these  challenges  with  ENGAGE’s  game-based 
narrative, designed to give students a strong sense of engagement 
and personal connection with each problem they solve. 
4.  PILOT STUDY 
Following  the  conclusion  of  the  focus  groups,  we  conducted  a 
small two-session pilot study with students from an urban middle 
school in Raleigh, North Carolina. The purpose of the study was 
to  observe  students’  success  at  completing  a  Big  Data  activity 
prototype and then to get a sense of their retention and continued 
interest  a  week later,  as  well as  have  them  complete  a  series  of 
follow-up Big Data learning activities. The first session consisted 
of a pre-survey, followed by working on the learning activity in 
collaborative  pairs,  and  then  ending  with  a  post-survey.  Focus 
groups held during the second session one week later centered on 
students’  general  conceptions  surrounding  Big  Data,  as  well  as 
their opinions on the various Big Data learning activities. 
4.1  Session 1: Big Data Activity 
A total of 15 students in 6th and 7th grades participated in the first 
pilot study session, which was held after school with a total time 
allotment  of  50  minutes  including  pre-survey  and  post-survey. 
Based  on  experience  from  prior  pilot  studies  in  which  students 
were predominantly male, the after-school coordinator was asked 
to emphasize recruiting female students. This emphasis succeeded 
and  13  of  the  15  participants  were  female.  The  demographic 
makeup was six white students, four African-American students, 
one  Latino  student,  one  Native  American  student,  one  Indian 
student, one Middle Eastern student, and one multiracial student.  
In  the  pre-survey,  students  were  asked  to  complete  the  New 
General  Self  Efficacy  (NGSE)  scale,  which  aims  to  explain 
variance  in  motivation  and  performance  by  measuring  students’ 
belief that they can achieve a goal [6]. Scores on the 8-item scale 
(a 5 point Likert) revealed a high overall level of self-efficacy for 
the  group  (M=4.408,  SD=0.513).  This  high  overall  self-efficacy 
may reflect a self-selection bias related to the after-school class.  
Students also completed Likert scale items scored from 1 (not at 
all  interested)  to  5  (very  interested)  relating  to  two  application 
domains:  marine  life  and  social  networking.  Marine  life  is  the 
application  domain  for  ENGAGE’s  game-based  narrative  and  an 
application  of  Big  Data  in  formal  science  education.  Social 
networking, on the other hand, is a human application of Big Data 
that the teacher focus groups indicated would be more relevant to 
students’ everyday lives. On average, students responded to “How 
interested are you in marine life?” with a 3.1 out of 5 (SD = 1.1), 
and to “How interested are you in social networks?” with a 3.3 out 
of 5 (SD = 1.6) While only 2 of the 15 students rated both marine 
life and social networks favorably (4 out of 5, or 5 out of 5), the 
number  of  students  who  rated  at  least  one  of  these  two  topics 
favorably was 12 out of 15, indicating that a Big Data curriculum 
that  includes  a  variety  of  topics  is  much  more  promising  than 
focusing on just one application domain.  
After  finishing  the  online  pre-surveys,  37  minutes  remained  for 
the Big Data activity prototype. Students were paired at computers  

 

 

Figure 1. Example visual subset of the fish database 

equipped  with  screen  capture  and  video  recording  for  future 
analysis.  In  the  activity,  students  progressed  through  a  written 
narrative  in  which  they  took  on  the  role  of  computer  scientists 
sent to rescue an underwater research station in distress. As part of 
the adventure, they had to locate a file for a particular fish species 
within a massive fish database. The activity guides students step-
by-step  through  a  skip  list  search  algorithm.  Figure  1  shows  an 
example subset of the fish database from the learning activity. 
Skip  lists,  widely  used  in  Big  Data  applications,  provide  an 
excellent  context  for  teaching  about  data  representation  and 
algorithms.  While  the  final  curriculum  will  include  many  other 
Big  Data  learning  activities  that  convey  the  excitement  and 
conceptual  value  of  Big  Data  (building  upon  the  success  of 
activities  piloted  elsewhere  [7]),  this  particular  Big  Data  pilot 
activity aimed to explore how Big Data applications can provide 
the framework for addressing other CS Principles Big Ideas, such 
as  computing  as  a  creative  activity  (Big  Idea  1)  and  algorithms 
(Big Idea 4). Using a slightly larger subset of the database than 
the one illustrated in Figure 1, students were tasked with finding 
the  shortest  path  to  various  target  fish.  The  activity  scaffolded 
students  through  each  step  of  the  skip  list  algorithm,  using  the 
visual subset of the database. After mastering the searching task 
manually on that concretely depicted subset, students then used a 
visual interface (simulating the visual programming language we 
will use in the ENGAGE game) to arrange pseudo-code blocks into 
a program that could traverse the entire database to find a desired 
fish  (in  this  case,  Surgeonfish).  An  ideal  algorithmic  solution  is 
shown in Figure 2. As described in the next section, this first Big 
Data activity is designed to occupy one entire classroom session 
of approximately 50 minutes.  
The  post-survey  included  a  User  Engagement  Scale  [19]  that 
measured involvement with the activity, focused attention, and the 
student’s desire to repeat a similar activity in the future. Overall, 
students agreed with the item, “I felt involved with this activity” 
(3.9  out  of  5;  SD  =  0.9),  and  generally  disagreed  with,  “I  felt 
discouraged while doing this activity” (1.9 out of 5; SD = 1.0). In 
contrast  to  these overall  positive ratings, there  was one African-

ABSTRACT 
Spurred  by  evidence  that  students’  future  studies  are  highly 
influenced  during  middle  school,  recent  efforts  have  seen  a 
growing  emphasis  on  introducing  computer  science  to  middle 
school 
in-progress 
development  of  a  new  middle  school  curricular  module  for  Big 
Data, situated as part of a new CS Principles-based middle school 
curriculum.  Big  Data  is  of  widespread  societal  importance  and 
holds increasing implications for the computer science workforce. 
It also has appeal as a focus for middle school computer science 
because  of  its  rich  interplay  with  other  important  computer 
science principles. This paper examines three key aspects of a Big 
Data  unit  for  middle  school:  its  alignment  with  emerging 
curricular standards; the perspectives of middle school classroom 
teachers in mathematics, science, and language arts; and student 
feedback  as  explored  during  a  middle  school  pilot  study  with  a 
small subset of the planned curriculum. The results indicate that a 
Big  Data  unit  holds  great  promise  as  part  of  a  middle  school 
computer science curriculum.

this  challenge 

choose  and  succeed  with  an  undergraduate  major:  previous 
positive  experience  with  a  subject  matter  plays  a  pivotal  role 
[2, 12].  This  point  has  particular  significance  within  the  field  of 
computer  science;  for  example,  a  very  small  number  of  US 
students take the traditional AP CS exam, and there is a troubling 
participation  gap  seen  in  that  small  body  of  test-takers  [2].  The 
discrepancy  corresponds  to  similarly  disappointing  statistics  for 
students who earn bachelor degrees in computer science [29]. 
In  both  their  stated  aspirations  and  in  their  development  of 
subject-specific  skills,  students  begin  their  career  trajectory  in 
middle  school  [14].  Researchers  have  specifically  traced  the 
underproduction and underrepresentation issues in undergraduate 
computer science departments back to lack of exposure as early as 
middle school [22, 26]. In the U.S., any middle school computer 
science  intervention  must  address  the  challenge  that  computer 
science  is  essentially  absent  from  standard  public  education 
curricula. Numerous successful middle school interventions have 
addressed 
through  after-school,  summer,  or 
enrichment-based activities; for example, these curricula often use 
various  visual  programming  languages  [15]  or  computer  games 
[25].  Yet  important  questions  remain  for  a  computer  science 
curriculum  designed  for  in-class  settings.  How  can  computer 
science  learning  objectives  be  aligned  with  new  curricular 
standards?  How  can  computer  science  be  successfully  delivered 
by  teachers  who  are  trained  in other  subjects? And  finally,  how 
can  we  build  learning  activities  that  are  highly  engaging  and 
developmentally appropriate for students? 
This paper examines these questions in the context of a proposed 
curricular unit for Big Data, one of the foci of the proposed AP 
Computer  Science  Principles  course  [7].  Although  a  full  formal 
definition  of  “Big  Data”  is  still  emerging,  the  phenomenon  is 
often  characterized  by  collection  at  high  velocity,  storage  in  a 
variety  of  structures,  and  large  volume  [8].  In  addition  to  its 
widespread  societal  importance  and  increasing  implications  for 
the computer science workforce, Big Data holds great promise as 
a  focus  for  middle  school  computer  science  because  of  its  rich 
interplay with other important CS Principles including algorithms, 
abstraction,  and  the  Internet.  As  this  paper  describes,  Big  Data 
also  represents  an  area  with  strong  correspondence  between  CS 
Principles and emerging US national curricular standards such as 
the  Common  Core  in  Mathematics  [5]  and  the  Next  Generation 
Science Standards [17, 18]. In addition to its strong links to other 
core  subjects,  the  topic  of  Big  Data  has  great  flexibility  in 

 

incorporating  other  highly  engaging  application  domains, 
including  those  that  are  relevant  to  kids’  everyday  lives.  For 
instance,  an  excellent  example  of  Big  Data  can  be  seen  within 
social  networks  and  their  massive  collections  of  structured  and 
unstructured data.  
The work reported here is conducted in the context of the ENGAGE 
project, a multi-year effort that will see development of a full CS 
Principles-based  middle  school  curriculum  situated  within  a 
game-based  learning  environment.  The  CS  Principles  approach 
may  be  well  suited  for  the  middle  school  level  because  the 
thematic threads of CS Principles Big Ideas can be introduced at a 
developmentally appropriate level for middle school students and 
thus provide the basis for more advanced work in high school. We 
are  developing  our  curriculum  in  an  iterative  fashion  with  pilot 
studies  and  focus  groups  on  each  set  of  prototype  learning 
activities.  This  paper  presents  the  work  to  date  on  the  Big  Data 
curricular  unit, including  its alignment  with emerging  standards, 
feedback from an interdisciplinary group of teachers, and results 
from a pilot study with middle school students. While the piloted 
activity represents only a small subset of the planned curriculum 
for  ENGAGE,  results  suggest  that  Big  Data  holds  appeal  for 
achieving  computer  science  learning  and  for  showcasing  the 
relevance of computer science to middle school students. 
2.  RELATED WORK 
Recent  years  have  seen  an  increase  in  the  number  of  middle 
school computing interventions, many of which innovate to teach 
programming  with  visual  or  graphical  programming  languages. 
Alice 3D has been used successfully [21], integrating computing 
within  the  context  of  a  wide  variety  of  subjects  such  as  math, 
science, and  language arts  [20],  and  to  help  students  understand 
what  their  future  careers  in  computing  might  look  like  [27]. 
Scratch programming has also been used extensively [4, 15, 23], 
including with students with disabilities [1], urban youth [16], or 
particular underrepresented groups [10]. Other languages such as 
Logo  [15]  and  more  recently  Kodu  [24]  have  also  been  used  in 
middle school interventions. There is also growing momentum for 
using game design and game programming [25] and robotics [13] 
as ways to introduce computer science to middle school students. 
Efforts  have  also  been  made 
to  formalize  assessment  of 
computational thinking at the middle school level [28]. 
In  complement  to  this  middle  school  work,  the  AP  Computer 
Science  Principles  course  is  being  developed  at  the  high  school 
level and plans to debut as an official, credit-bearing course in the 
2016-17  academic  year  [7].  CS  Principles  is  organized  around 
seven Big Ideas, one of which is Big Data. Students must analyze, 
interpret, and gain new insight from data sets, both visually and 
statistically [7]. Relatedly, Berkeley’s CS Principles pilot course, 
"The Beauty and Joy of Computing" has sections on the impact of 
Big  Data  and  information  technology  in  modern  life  [11]. 
Notably, this aspect of social relevance is a motivating factor for 
women to enter and remain in computer science [9]. Our current 
work takes inspiration from these CS Principles pilots, in concert 
with  teacher  and  student  focus  group  feedback,  in  developing  a 
Big Data curricular unit. 
3.  BIG DATA CURRICULUM DESIGN 
An important focus of our ongoing work is to develop a suite of 
learning activities that can be adopted within a variety of middle 
school contexts including standalone computer science courses or 
as enrichment for subject matter areas including mathematics and 
science.  A  vital  step  toward  this  goal  is  aligning  the  CS 
Principles-based  curriculum  with  current  standards  for  middle

school  grade  levels.  We  first  analyzed  the  Common  Core  State 
Standards for English and Mathematics, and the Next Generation 
Science  Standards,  and  then  conducted  teacher  focus  groups  to 
gain  feedback  on  this  alignment  and  to  help  tailor  the  proposed 
Big Data curriculum to middle school classrooms. 
3.1  Alignment with Curricular Standards 
3.1.1  Common Core State Standards 
Beginning in 2009, the Common Core State Standards Initiative 
created  a  set  of  curricular  standards  intended  to  align  the 
previously separate curricula of individual states within the U.S. 
According to its mission statement, these standards, “are designed 
to  be  robust  and  relevant  to  the  real  world,  reflecting  the 
knowledge  and  skills  that  our  young  people  need  for  success  in 
college and careers” [5]. Common Core for Mathematics laid out 
a  series  of  high-level  practices  through  which  students  are 
expected 
in  problems,  use  abstract  and 
quantitative reasoning, construct arguments, critique the reasoning 
of  others,  and  model  with  mathematics.  Similarly,  the  CS 
Principles  curriculum  frames  seven  Big  Ideas  around  the  core 
computational 
thinking  practices  of  connecting  computing, 
developing  computational  artifacts,  abstracting,  analyzing 
problems  and  artifacts,  communicating,  and  collaborating  [7]. 
Table  1  highlights  some  important  parallels  between  the  CS 
Principles  Computational  Thinking  (CT)  Practices  and 
the 
practices for the Common Core in Mathematics.  
At a high level, both CS Principles and the Common Core include 
big ideas on data. While the Common Core standards relating to 
data do not map directly to the corresponding CS Principles Big 
Idea, we see the opportunity for a curriculum that serves the goals 
of both CS Principles and the Common Core in a complementary 
fashion. Table 2 shows Learning Objectives for CS Principles and 
selected standards from the Common Core that relate to data.

3.1.2  The Next Generation Science Standards 
Similar to the Common Core, the precursor Framework report and 
Next Generation Science Standards in the U.S. [17, 18] does not 
explicitly  address  computer  science,  but  holds  promise  for  the 
development of complementary curricula. The Framework report 
states  that  elements  of  both  computational  and  mathematical

thinking  are  central  to  K-12  science  education,  and  these  are 
addressed  through  the  discussion  of  science  and  engineering 
practices  and  crosscutting  concepts  [18].  These  science  and 
engineering  practices  recognize  the  importance  of  identifying 
student  outcomes  that  go  beyond  memorizing  narrowly  focused 
scientific  facts;  they  provide  a  broader  interpretation  of  science 
inquiry that includes computational approaches. 
The  Next  Generation  Science  Standards  stated  practices  include 
both analyzing and interpreting data, and using mathematical and 
computational  thinking  [17].  The  Framework  was  clear  that  the 
eventual  Standards  documents  needed 
to  address  how 
mathematical  and  computational 
techniques  are 
deployed  in  the  service  of  analyzing  large  data  sets:  “Such  data 
sets  extend  the  range  of  students’  experiences  and  help  to 
illuminate  this  important  practice  of  analyzing  and  interpreting 
data” [18]. As this statement illustrates, there is great promise for 
creating  curricula  in  which  the  power  of  computer  science  is 
illustrated within the context of widely required subject matter.

3.2  Teacher Focus Groups 
With  this  alignment  in  hand  between  the  proposed  Big  Data 
concepts  and  standard  curricula,  the  next  step  was  to  obtain 
detailed  feedback  from  experienced  middle  school  teachers  to 
inform the development of specific learning activities. We held a 
series  of  in-depth  classroom  teacher  focus  groups  during  the 
summer of 2013. Three teachers from an urban middle school in 
Raleigh,  North  Carolina  were  recruited 
to  participate  for 
approximately 40 hours each in both group and solo sessions. The 
teachers were two females and one male, and all three were from 
minority  groups  that  are  underrepresented  in  computer  science. 
They included one 8th grade math teacher, one 7th grade science 
teacher, and one 7th grade language arts teacher. Each focus group 
session lasted between three and four hours and the format varied 
depending  on  the  topic.  Early  sessions  focused  on  introducing 
computer science topics to the teachers. These sessions involved 
both  presentations  and  guided classroom  activities  conducted  by 
project 
team  members.  Later  focus  groups  were  heavily 
discussion-based,  as  teachers  brainstormed  on  how  to  teach 
computer  science  principles  to  middle  school  students,  and 
drafting classroom activities.  
3.2.1  8th Grade Math 
The 8th grade math teacher expressed some initial hesitation to the 
idea  of  teaching  Big  Data  to  middle  school  students,  concerned 
that  its  concepts  would  be  out  of  reach  given  the  students’ 
development level. However, she became much more receptive to 
the idea after a more thorough discussion and explanation of Big 
Data.  She  emphasized  the  need  to  introduce  topics  in  “baby 
steps.” She noted that middle school students are still developing 
the  mathematical  background  to  perform  statistical  computation. 
A question she raised was, “To what degree and depth do we want 
them to understand Big Data…and have it support the Common 
Core?” Another of her primary concerns was, “How do we do it in 
a way that is not overwhelming to them…and that they say ‘Wow, 
cool.  How  can  I  use  this  in  my  life  today?’”  The  other  two 
teachers  echoed  this  sentiment,  emphasizing  that  the  curriculum 
should be grounded in human applications to which students can 
personally relate. As will be described in Section 4, our iterative 
curriculum development process involves measuring the extent to 
which students relate to each prototype learning activity. 
3.2.2  7th Grade Science 
The  science  teacher  provided  insight  into  how  to  create  middle 
school  activities  that  support  what  students  are  learning  in  their 
science  classes.  In  particular,  she  emphasized  that  we  should 
reinforce  the  scientific  method,  which  all  students  in  grades  six 
through  eight  have  learned and  use  in  their  science  classes.  She 
also noted that reading tables and graphs is difficult in general for 
students,  but  is  an  important  skill  for  them  to  learn.  Making 
inferences  or  forecasting  from  data  is  particularly  difficult  for 
middle school students, so she suggested ways to slowly introduce 
the  material  over 
to  avoid  overly  abstract 
representations.  This  advice  guided  the  scaffolding  included 
within the first Big Data activity, described in Section 4.  
3.2.3  7th Grade Language Arts 
The 7th grade language arts teacher quickly saw implications for 
his  classroom.  For  instance,  he  uses  Wordle1  to  generate  “word 
clouds” from texts before his class reads a book. As a class, they 
use the most prevalent words to make predictions on the dominant 
themes that might appear in the book. After the lesson on “What

time,  and 

 

is Big Data”, the teacher saw this activity as a good opportunity to 
broaden the discussion in his classroom to include Big Data. Also 
certified as a social studies teacher, he drew a parallel between a 
challenge 
that  middle  school  students  might  have  with 
programming and one they have in social studies: “sequencing is a 
difficulty for kids.” He noted that middle school students struggle 
to  make  the  connection  from  past  to  present,  from  present  to 
future,  and  from  self  to  global  community.  Our  team  aims  to 
address  some  of  these  challenges  with  ENGAGE’s  game-based 
narrative, designed to give students a strong sense of engagement 
and personal connection with each problem they solve. 
4.  PILOT STUDY 
Following  the  conclusion  of  the  focus  groups,  we  conducted  a 
small two-session pilot study with students from an urban middle 
school in Raleigh, North Carolina. The purpose of the study was 
to  observe  students’  success  at  completing  a  Big  Data  activity 
prototype and then to get a sense of their retention and continued 
interest  a  week later,  as  well as  have  them  complete  a  series  of 
follow-up Big Data learning activities. The first session consisted 
of a pre-survey, followed by working on the learning activity in 
collaborative  pairs,  and  then  ending  with  a  post-survey.  Focus 
groups held during the second session one week later centered on 
students’  general  conceptions  surrounding  Big  Data,  as  well  as 
their opinions on the various Big Data learning activities. 
4.1  Session 1: Big Data Activity 
A total of 15 students in 6th and 7th grades participated in the first 
pilot study session, which was held after school with a total time 
allotment  of  50  minutes  including  pre-survey  and  post-survey. 
Based  on  experience  from  prior  pilot  studies  in  which  students 
were predominantly male, the after-school coordinator was asked 
to emphasize recruiting female students. This emphasis succeeded 
and  13  of  the  15  participants  were  female.  The  demographic 
makeup was six white students, four African-American students, 
one  Latino  student,  one  Native  American  student,  one  Indian 
student, one Middle Eastern student, and one multiracial student.  
In  the  pre-survey,  students  were  asked  to  complete  the  New 
General  Self  Efficacy  (NGSE)  scale,  which  aims  to  explain 
variance  in  motivation  and  performance  by  measuring  students’ 
belief that they can achieve a goal [6]. Scores on the 8-item scale 
(a 5 point Likert) revealed a high overall level of self-efficacy for 
the  group  (M=4.408,  SD=0.513).  This  high  overall  self-efficacy 
may reflect a self-selection bias related to the after-school class.  
Students also completed Likert scale items scored from 1 (not at 
all  interested)  to  5  (very  interested)  relating  to  two  application 
domains:  marine  life  and  social  networking.  Marine  life  is  the 
application  domain  for  ENGAGE’s  game-based  narrative  and  an 
application  of  Big  Data  in  formal  science  education.  Social 
networking, on the other hand, is a human application of Big Data 
that the teacher focus groups indicated would be more relevant to 
students’ everyday lives. On average, students responded to “How 
interested are you in marine life?” with a 3.1 out of 5 (SD = 1.1), 
and to “How interested are you in social networks?” with a 3.3 out 
of 5 (SD = 1.6) While only 2 of the 15 students rated both marine 
life and social networks favorably (4 out of 5, or 5 out of 5), the 
number  of  students  who  rated  at  least  one  of  these  two  topics 
favorably was 12 out of 15, indicating that a Big Data curriculum 
that  includes  a  variety  of  topics  is  much  more  promising  than 
focusing on just one application domain.  
After  finishing  the  online  pre-surveys,  37  minutes  remained  for 
the Big Data activity prototype. Students were paired at computers  

 

 

Figure 1. Example visual subset of the fish database 

equipped  with  screen  capture  and  video  recording  for  future 
analysis.  In  the  activity,  students  progressed  through  a  written 
narrative  in  which  they  took  on  the  role  of  computer  scientists 
sent to rescue an underwater research station in distress. As part of 
the adventure, they had to locate a file for a particular fish species 
within a massive fish database. The activity guides students step-
by-step  through  a  skip  list  search  algorithm.  Figure  1  shows  an 
example subset of the fish database from the learning activity. 
Skip  lists,  widely  used  in  Big  Data  applications,  provide  an 
excellent  context  for  teaching  about  data  representation  and 
algorithms.  While  the  final  curriculum  will  include  many  other 
Big  Data  learning  activities  that  convey  the  excitement  and 
conceptual  value  of  Big  Data  (building  upon  the  success  of 
activities  piloted  elsewhere  [7]),  this  particular  Big  Data  pilot 
activity aimed to explore how Big Data applications can provide 
the framework for addressing other CS Principles Big Ideas, such 
as  computing  as  a  creative  activity  (Big  Idea  1)  and  algorithms 
(Big Idea 4). Using a slightly larger subset of the database than 
the one illustrated in Figure 1, students were tasked with finding 
the  shortest  path  to  various  target  fish.  The  activity  scaffolded 
students  through  each  step  of  the  skip  list  algorithm,  using  the 
visual subset of the database. After mastering the searching task 
manually on that concretely depicted subset, students then used a 
visual interface (simulating the visual programming language we 
will use in the ENGAGE game) to arrange pseudo-code blocks into 
a program that could traverse the entire database to find a desired 
fish  (in  this  case,  Surgeonfish).  An  ideal  algorithmic  solution  is 
shown in Figure 2. As described in the next section, this first Big 
Data activity is designed to occupy one entire classroom session 
of approximately 50 minutes.  
The  post-survey  included  a  User  Engagement  Scale  [19]  that 
measured involvement with the activity, focused attention, and the 
student’s desire to repeat a similar activity in the future. Overall, 
students agreed with the item, “I felt involved with this activity” 
(3.9  out  of  5;  SD  =  0.9),  and  generally  disagreed  with,  “I  felt 
discouraged while doing this activity” (1.9 out of 5; SD = 1.0). In 
contrast  to  these overall  positive ratings, there  was one African-

lower  feeling  of 

American  female  student  who  responded  with  a  2  for  “I  felt 
involved with the activity”, and with a 4 for  “I  felt discouraged 
while  doing  this  activity”.  Among  all  the  students  in  the  study, 
this  student  had  demonstrated  the  greatest  interest  in  social 
networking,  with  lower  stated  interest  in  marine  life,  possibly 
explaining  her 
involvement  and  higher 
discouragement with the marine life Big Data activity. As will be 
described  in  Section  5.2,  this  student  later  made  contributions 
during the later focus group that shed light on her experience.  
Overall, students rated, “This activity was fun” with 2.8 out of 5 
SD  =  1.3),  lower  than  hoped.  Because  the  prototype  activity  is 
being  developed  for  use  within  ENGAGE’s  game-based  learning 
environment,  fun  is  an  important  emphasis.  Upon  reflection,  we 
believe that the pace of the learning activity (with several minutes 
elapsing between achievements on the task) may have hindered a 
sense  of  fun,  which  will  be  addressed  in  future  iterations.  It  is 
important  that  students  frequently  feel  a  sense  of  achievement, 
even if the successes represent incremental steps toward the larger 
goal.  Also  providing  helpful  feedback,  students did  not  disagree 
with “I found this activity to be confusing” (3.2 out of 5; SD = 
1.1), indicating room for improvement on the scaffolding. Based 
on all of the students’ feedback, we designed session 2 of the pilot 
study, which was held one week later. 
4.2  Session 2: Focus Groups 
Of  the  original  15  students,  11  returned  the  next  week  for  the 
second session, joined by three new students. As with Session 1, 
all students were in 6th and 7th grades. The demographics for the 
second session were as follows: 12 female and 2 male; 3 white, 6 
African-American,  1  Latino,  1  Native  American,  1  Indian,  1 
Middle  Eastern,  and  1  multiracial  student.  The  students  were 
separated  into  three  focus  groups  of  four  or  five  students  per 
group,  each  facilitated  by  a  member  of  the  research  team.  Each 
group spent roughly 15 minutes discussing students’ conceptions 
of  computer  science  and  programming,  and  then  15  minutes  on 
data. A series of follow-up activities to the previous session’s Big 
Data  activity  were  then  done  in  groups,  with  the  new  students 
paired up with students who had attended the previous week. The 
general purpose of these focus groups was to get student feedback 
on  what  works  and  what  needs  improvement  in  our  Big  Data 
curriculum.  Particular  attention  was  paid  to  eliciting  feedback 
from  students  who  reported  negative  opinions  on  the  Big  Data 
activity in session 1. 
As  predicted,  students  had  a  limited  understanding  of  what  Big 
Data  might  be.  They  could  discuss  data  on  a  smaller  scale, 
describing it as information that you can get and store: “anything 
you  want  to  keep  over  a  long  time.”  They  were  familiar  with 
examples  of  data  in  science,  such  as  weather  patterns  or  plant 
biology, and some saw the purpose of data being “to do a science 
project.”  Although  they  seemed  not  to  have  given  much  prior 
thought to other issues related to data, some students got excited 
thinking  about  the  topic.  When  asked  about  data  storage,  one 
group  of  female  students  interpreted  this  question  in  terms  of 
communication 
their 
conversation. 
 
Facilitator: Where is data stored? 
Student 1:  On the ground, on a paper, you can put it anywhere. 
Student 2:  You could put it on the back of a spaghetti can. 
Facilitator: Yes you could, but would it be helpful there? 
Student 3:  You could put [the spaghetti can] in the pantry. 
Student 2: Like a community pantry.

When  considered  in  light  of  CS  Principles  Learning  Objectives 
3.1.2  and  3.1.3  (Table  2),  the  above  dialogue  illustrates  the 
potential of data to be socially relevant, a key concern for girls in 
computer science. Following up on this finding, we also prompted 
the  students  to  think  about  data  for  social  networking.  Most 
students  had  never  previously  given  thought  to  data  outside  of 
science domains, but even students who had been quiet up to this 
point in the focus group expressed interest in these examples of 
data in their everyday lives. 
After  discussing  computer  science,  programming  and  data, 
students  collaboratively  worked  on  a  series  of  short  activities 
related to the Big Data activity from the session 1. Like that prior 
activity, these were prototypes of activities being considered for 
ENGAGE’s game-based learning environment. Consequently, they 
were presented as elements of the game’s story, with students told 
that their feedback would influence the development of the game. 
In designing these activities, we aimed to improve on the design 
of the activity from session 1, such as by decreasing the amount of 
reading  required.  We  also  sought  to  obtain  student  feedback  on 
Big Data applications that convey the full power and conceptual 
value  of  Big  Data.  Overall,  students  were  noticeably  engaged 
during this session. It included an activity involving cryptography, 
previously used for engaging middle school students in computer 
science [3], and a problem in which students solved a mystery by 
examining clusters of marine data to track a leaked pollutant.  
The post-survey revealed that students felt more positively about 
the activities in this session than they did about the activity from 
session 1. Students rated these activities highly for “fun” (4.1 out 
of 5; SD = 0.8) and low for “confusing” (2.1 out of 5; SD = 0.8). 
Feedback  was  also  more  consistently  positive,  including  for  the 
African-American female student reporting negative feelings after 
session 1 (see Section 5.1). During the discussion, she advocated 
for  including  social  networking  features  in  the  ENGAGE  game, 
particularly the ability to chat with other players: “Everyone likes 
chatting.”  Similar  to  the  conversation  in  Figure  3,  this  student’s 
comments  highlight  the  importance  of  communication  and 
collaboration,  two  of  the  Learning  Objectives  for  CS  Principles 
Big  Idea  3  (Table  2).  While  the  improved  positivity  may  be 
partially  explained  by  repeated  exposure  to  the  topic,  bringing 
greater levels of comfort, it also confirms the notion expressed by 
the  classroom  teachers  in  our  focus  groups:  a  middle  school 
curriculum can benefit from including activities that are relevant 
to students’ everyday lives.  
5.  CONCLUSION  
A curriculum based on Computer Science Principles holds great 
promise for middle school, and the CS Principles related to Big 
Data may be particularly well suited for this age group. We have 
presented  a  case  for  teaching  Big  Data  including  its  strong 
alignment  with  standard  U.S.  curricula  including  the  Common 
Core  and  the  Next  Generation Science  Standards.  We  have  also 
presented  results  from  classroom  teacher  focus  groups  that 
suggest Big Data can serve to enrich core subject matter including 
science, mathematics, and language arts. Lastly, we examined the 
findings  of  a  small  pilot  study  with  middle  school  students  that 
yielded several important lessons for refining the curriculum and 
learning tasks. First, although we created a learning activity with 
distinct subtasks, breaking these down even further and providing 
incremental  achievements  along  the  way  may  increase  students’ 
sense of fun and decrease confusion. Second, including a variety 
of  application  domains  can  strategically engage a  broader  set  of 
learners  with  the  Big  Data  activities.  Finally,  focus  group 
feedback indicates that students may intuitively gravitate toward

ABSTRACT 
Spurred  by  evidence  that  students’  future  studies  are  highly 
influenced  during  middle  school,  recent  efforts  have  seen  a 
growing  emphasis  on  introducing  computer  science  to  middle 
school 
in-progress 
development  of  a  new  middle  school  curricular  module  for  Big 
Data, situated as part of a new CS Principles-based middle school 
curriculum.  Big  Data  is  of  widespread  societal  importance  and 
holds increasing implications for the computer science workforce. 
It also has appeal as a focus for middle school computer science 
because  of  its  rich  interplay  with  other  important  computer 
science principles. This paper examines three key aspects of a Big 
Data  unit  for  middle  school:  its  alignment  with  emerging 
curricular standards; the perspectives of middle school classroom 
teachers in mathematics, science, and language arts; and student 
feedback  as  explored  during  a  middle  school  pilot  study  with  a 
small subset of the planned curriculum. The results indicate that a 
Big  Data  unit  holds  great  promise  as  part  of  a  middle  school 
computer science curriculum.

this  challenge 

choose  and  succeed  with  an  undergraduate  major:  previous 
positive  experience  with  a  subject  matter  plays  a  pivotal  role 
[2, 12].  This  point  has  particular  significance  within  the  field  of 
computer  science;  for  example,  a  very  small  number  of  US 
students take the traditional AP CS exam, and there is a troubling 
participation  gap  seen  in  that  small  body  of  test-takers  [2].  The 
discrepancy  corresponds  to  similarly  disappointing  statistics  for 
students who earn bachelor degrees in computer science [29]. 
In  both  their  stated  aspirations  and  in  their  development  of 
subject-specific  skills,  students  begin  their  career  trajectory  in 
middle  school  [14].  Researchers  have  specifically  traced  the 
underproduction and underrepresentation issues in undergraduate 
computer science departments back to lack of exposure as early as 
middle school [22, 26]. In the U.S., any middle school computer 
science  intervention  must  address  the  challenge  that  computer 
science  is  essentially  absent  from  standard  public  education 
curricula. Numerous successful middle school interventions have 
addressed 
through  after-school,  summer,  or 
enrichment-based activities; for example, these curricula often use 
various  visual  programming  languages  [15]  or  computer  games 
[25].  Yet  important  questions  remain  for  a  computer  science 
curriculum  designed  for  in-class  settings.  How  can  computer 
science  learning  objectives  be  aligned  with  new  curricular 
standards?  How  can  computer  science  be  successfully  delivered 
by  teachers  who  are  trained  in other  subjects? And  finally,  how 
can  we  build  learning  activities  that  are  highly  engaging  and 
developmentally appropriate for students? 
This paper examines these questions in the context of a proposed 
curricular unit for Big Data, one of the foci of the proposed AP 
Computer  Science  Principles  course  [7].  Although  a  full  formal 
definition  of  “Big  Data”  is  still  emerging,  the  phenomenon  is 
often  characterized  by  collection  at  high  velocity,  storage  in  a 
variety  of  structures,  and  large  volume  [8].  In  addition  to  its 
widespread  societal  importance  and  increasing  implications  for 
the computer science workforce, Big Data holds great promise as 
a  focus  for  middle  school  computer  science  because  of  its  rich 
interplay with other important CS Principles including algorithms, 
abstraction,  and  the  Internet.  As  this  paper  describes,  Big  Data 
also  represents  an  area  with  strong  correspondence  between  CS 
Principles and emerging US national curricular standards such as 
the  Common  Core  in  Mathematics  [5]  and  the  Next  Generation 
Science Standards [17, 18]. In addition to its strong links to other 
core  subjects,  the  topic  of  Big  Data  has  great  flexibility  in 

 

incorporating  other  highly  engaging  application  domains, 
including  those  that  are  relevant  to  kids’  everyday  lives.  For 
instance,  an  excellent  example  of  Big  Data  can  be  seen  within 
social  networks  and  their  massive  collections  of  structured  and 
unstructured data.  
The work reported here is conducted in the context of the ENGAGE 
project, a multi-year effort that will see development of a full CS 
Principles-based  middle  school  curriculum  situated  within  a 
game-based  learning  environment.  The  CS  Principles  approach 
may  be  well  suited  for  the  middle  school  level  because  the 
thematic threads of CS Principles Big Ideas can be introduced at a 
developmentally appropriate level for middle school students and 
thus provide the basis for more advanced work in high school. We 
are  developing  our  curriculum  in  an  iterative  fashion  with  pilot 
studies  and  focus  groups  on  each  set  of  prototype  learning 
activities.  This  paper  presents  the  work  to  date  on  the  Big  Data 
curricular  unit, including  its alignment  with emerging  standards, 
feedback from an interdisciplinary group of teachers, and results 
from a pilot study with middle school students. While the piloted 
activity represents only a small subset of the planned curriculum 
for  ENGAGE,  results  suggest  that  Big  Data  holds  appeal  for 
achieving  computer  science  learning  and  for  showcasing  the 
relevance of computer science to middle school students. 
2.  RELATED WORK 
Recent  years  have  seen  an  increase  in  the  number  of  middle 
school computing interventions, many of which innovate to teach 
programming  with  visual  or  graphical  programming  languages. 
Alice 3D has been used successfully [21], integrating computing 
within  the  context  of  a  wide  variety  of  subjects  such  as  math, 
science, and  language arts  [20],  and  to  help  students  understand 
what  their  future  careers  in  computing  might  look  like  [27]. 
Scratch programming has also been used extensively [4, 15, 23], 
including with students with disabilities [1], urban youth [16], or 
particular underrepresented groups [10]. Other languages such as 
Logo  [15]  and  more  recently  Kodu  [24]  have  also  been  used  in 
middle school interventions. There is also growing momentum for 
using game design and game programming [25] and robotics [13] 
as ways to introduce computer science to middle school students. 
Efforts  have  also  been  made 
to  formalize  assessment  of 
computational thinking at the middle school level [28]. 
In  complement  to  this  middle  school  work,  the  AP  Computer 
Science  Principles  course  is  being  developed  at  the  high  school 
level and plans to debut as an official, credit-bearing course in the 
2016-17  academic  year  [7].  CS  Principles  is  organized  around 
seven Big Ideas, one of which is Big Data. Students must analyze, 
interpret, and gain new insight from data sets, both visually and 
statistically [7]. Relatedly, Berkeley’s CS Principles pilot course, 
"The Beauty and Joy of Computing" has sections on the impact of 
Big  Data  and  information  technology  in  modern  life  [11]. 
Notably, this aspect of social relevance is a motivating factor for 
women to enter and remain in computer science [9]. Our current 
work takes inspiration from these CS Principles pilots, in concert 
with  teacher  and  student  focus  group  feedback,  in  developing  a 
Big Data curricular unit. 
3.  BIG DATA CURRICULUM DESIGN 
An important focus of our ongoing work is to develop a suite of 
learning activities that can be adopted within a variety of middle 
school contexts including standalone computer science courses or 
as enrichment for subject matter areas including mathematics and 
science.  A  vital  step  toward  this  goal  is  aligning  the  CS 
Principles-based  curriculum  with  current  standards  for  middle

school  grade  levels.  We  first  analyzed  the  Common  Core  State 
Standards for English and Mathematics, and the Next Generation 
Science  Standards,  and  then  conducted  teacher  focus  groups  to 
gain  feedback  on  this  alignment  and  to  help  tailor  the  proposed 
Big Data curriculum to middle school classrooms. 
3.1  Alignment with Curricular Standards 
3.1.1  Common Core State Standards 
Beginning in 2009, the Common Core State Standards Initiative 
created  a  set  of  curricular  standards  intended  to  align  the 
previously separate curricula of individual states within the U.S. 
According to its mission statement, these standards, “are designed 
to  be  robust  and  relevant  to  the  real  world,  reflecting  the 
knowledge  and  skills  that  our  young  people  need  for  success  in 
college and careers” [5]. Common Core for Mathematics laid out 
a  series  of  high-level  practices  through  which  students  are 
expected 
in  problems,  use  abstract  and 
quantitative reasoning, construct arguments, critique the reasoning 
of  others,  and  model  with  mathematics.  Similarly,  the  CS 
Principles  curriculum  frames  seven  Big  Ideas  around  the  core 
computational 
thinking  practices  of  connecting  computing, 
developing  computational  artifacts,  abstracting,  analyzing 
problems  and  artifacts,  communicating,  and  collaborating  [7]. 
Table  1  highlights  some  important  parallels  between  the  CS 
Principles  Computational  Thinking  (CT)  Practices  and 
the 
practices for the Common Core in Mathematics.  
At a high level, both CS Principles and the Common Core include 
big ideas on data. While the Common Core standards relating to 
data do not map directly to the corresponding CS Principles Big 
Idea, we see the opportunity for a curriculum that serves the goals 
of both CS Principles and the Common Core in a complementary 
fashion. Table 2 shows Learning Objectives for CS Principles and 
selected standards from the Common Core that relate to data.

3.1.2  The Next Generation Science Standards 
Similar to the Common Core, the precursor Framework report and 
Next Generation Science Standards in the U.S. [17, 18] does not 
explicitly  address  computer  science,  but  holds  promise  for  the 
development of complementary curricula. The Framework report 
states  that  elements  of  both  computational  and  mathematical

thinking  are  central  to  K-12  science  education,  and  these  are 
addressed  through  the  discussion  of  science  and  engineering 
practices  and  crosscutting  concepts  [18].  These  science  and 
engineering  practices  recognize  the  importance  of  identifying 
student  outcomes  that  go  beyond  memorizing  narrowly  focused 
scientific  facts;  they  provide  a  broader  interpretation  of  science 
inquiry that includes computational approaches. 
The  Next  Generation  Science  Standards  stated  practices  include 
both analyzing and interpreting data, and using mathematical and 
computational  thinking  [17].  The  Framework  was  clear  that  the 
eventual  Standards  documents  needed 
to  address  how 
mathematical  and  computational 
techniques  are 
deployed  in  the  service  of  analyzing  large  data  sets:  “Such  data 
sets  extend  the  range  of  students’  experiences  and  help  to 
illuminate  this  important  practice  of  analyzing  and  interpreting 
data” [18]. As this statement illustrates, there is great promise for 
creating  curricula  in  which  the  power  of  computer  science  is 
illustrated within the context of widely required subject matter.

3.2  Teacher Focus Groups 
With  this  alignment  in  hand  between  the  proposed  Big  Data 
concepts  and  standard  curricula,  the  next  step  was  to  obtain 
detailed  feedback  from  experienced  middle  school  teachers  to 
inform the development of specific learning activities. We held a 
series  of  in-depth  classroom  teacher  focus  groups  during  the 
summer of 2013. Three teachers from an urban middle school in 
Raleigh,  North  Carolina  were  recruited 
to  participate  for 
approximately 40 hours each in both group and solo sessions. The 
teachers were two females and one male, and all three were from 
minority  groups  that  are  underrepresented  in  computer  science. 
They included one 8th grade math teacher, one 7th grade science 
teacher, and one 7th grade language arts teacher. Each focus group 
session lasted between three and four hours and the format varied 
depending  on  the  topic.  Early  sessions  focused  on  introducing 
computer science topics to the teachers. These sessions involved 
both  presentations  and  guided classroom  activities  conducted  by 
project 
team  members.  Later  focus  groups  were  heavily 
discussion-based,  as  teachers  brainstormed  on  how  to  teach 
computer  science  principles  to  middle  school  students,  and 
drafting classroom activities.  
3.2.1  8th Grade Math 
The 8th grade math teacher expressed some initial hesitation to the 
idea  of  teaching  Big  Data  to  middle  school  students,  concerned 
that  its  concepts  would  be  out  of  reach  given  the  students’ 
development level. However, she became much more receptive to 
the idea after a more thorough discussion and explanation of Big 
Data.  She  emphasized  the  need  to  introduce  topics  in  “baby 
steps.” She noted that middle school students are still developing 
the  mathematical  background  to  perform  statistical  computation. 
A question she raised was, “To what degree and depth do we want 
them to understand Big Data…and have it support the Common 
Core?” Another of her primary concerns was, “How do we do it in 
a way that is not overwhelming to them…and that they say ‘Wow, 
cool.  How  can  I  use  this  in  my  life  today?’”  The  other  two 
teachers  echoed  this  sentiment,  emphasizing  that  the  curriculum 
should be grounded in human applications to which students can 
personally relate. As will be described in Section 4, our iterative 
curriculum development process involves measuring the extent to 
which students relate to each prototype learning activity. 
3.2.2  7th Grade Science 
The  science  teacher  provided  insight  into  how  to  create  middle 
school  activities  that  support  what  students  are  learning  in  their 
science  classes.  In  particular,  she  emphasized  that  we  should 
reinforce  the  scientific  method,  which  all  students  in  grades  six 
through  eight  have  learned and  use  in  their  science  classes.  She 
also noted that reading tables and graphs is difficult in general for 
students,  but  is  an  important  skill  for  them  to  learn.  Making 
inferences  or  forecasting  from  data  is  particularly  difficult  for 
middle school students, so she suggested ways to slowly introduce 
the  material  over 
to  avoid  overly  abstract 
representations.  This  advice  guided  the  scaffolding  included 
within the first Big Data activity, described in Section 4.  
3.2.3  7th Grade Language Arts 
The 7th grade language arts teacher quickly saw implications for 
his  classroom.  For  instance,  he  uses  Wordle1  to  generate  “word 
clouds” from texts before his class reads a book. As a class, they 
use the most prevalent words to make predictions on the dominant 
themes that might appear in the book. After the lesson on “What

time,  and 

 

is Big Data”, the teacher saw this activity as a good opportunity to 
broaden the discussion in his classroom to include Big Data. Also 
certified as a social studies teacher, he drew a parallel between a 
challenge 
that  middle  school  students  might  have  with 
programming and one they have in social studies: “sequencing is a 
difficulty for kids.” He noted that middle school students struggle 
to  make  the  connection  from  past  to  present,  from  present  to 
future,  and  from  self  to  global  community.  Our  team  aims  to 
address  some  of  these  challenges  with  ENGAGE’s  game-based 
narrative, designed to give students a strong sense of engagement 
and personal connection with each problem they solve. 
4.  PILOT STUDY 
Following  the  conclusion  of  the  focus  groups,  we  conducted  a 
small two-session pilot study with students from an urban middle 
school in Raleigh, North Carolina. The purpose of the study was 
to  observe  students’  success  at  completing  a  Big  Data  activity 
prototype and then to get a sense of their retention and continued 
interest  a  week later,  as  well as  have  them  complete  a  series  of 
follow-up Big Data learning activities. The first session consisted 
of a pre-survey, followed by working on the learning activity in 
collaborative  pairs,  and  then  ending  with  a  post-survey.  Focus 
groups held during the second session one week later centered on 
students’  general  conceptions  surrounding  Big  Data,  as  well  as 
their opinions on the various Big Data learning activities. 
4.1  Session 1: Big Data Activity 
A total of 15 students in 6th and 7th grades participated in the first 
pilot study session, which was held after school with a total time 
allotment  of  50  minutes  including  pre-survey  and  post-survey. 
Based  on  experience  from  prior  pilot  studies  in  which  students 
were predominantly male, the after-school coordinator was asked 
to emphasize recruiting female students. This emphasis succeeded 
and  13  of  the  15  participants  were  female.  The  demographic 
makeup was six white students, four African-American students, 
one  Latino  student,  one  Native  American  student,  one  Indian 
student, one Middle Eastern student, and one multiracial student.  
In  the  pre-survey,  students  were  asked  to  complete  the  New 
General  Self  Efficacy  (NGSE)  scale,  which  aims  to  explain 
variance  in  motivation  and  performance  by  measuring  students’ 
belief that they can achieve a goal [6]. Scores on the 8-item scale 
(a 5 point Likert) revealed a high overall level of self-efficacy for 
the  group  (M=4.408,  SD=0.513).  This  high  overall  self-efficacy 
may reflect a self-selection bias related to the after-school class.  
Students also completed Likert scale items scored from 1 (not at 
all  interested)  to  5  (very  interested)  relating  to  two  application 
domains:  marine  life  and  social  networking.  Marine  life  is  the 
application  domain  for  ENGAGE’s  game-based  narrative  and  an 
application  of  Big  Data  in  formal  science  education.  Social 
networking, on the other hand, is a human application of Big Data 
that the teacher focus groups indicated would be more relevant to 
students’ everyday lives. On average, students responded to “How 
interested are you in marine life?” with a 3.1 out of 5 (SD = 1.1), 
and to “How interested are you in social networks?” with a 3.3 out 
of 5 (SD = 1.6) While only 2 of the 15 students rated both marine 
life and social networks favorably (4 out of 5, or 5 out of 5), the 
number  of  students  who  rated  at  least  one  of  these  two  topics 
favorably was 12 out of 15, indicating that a Big Data curriculum 
that  includes  a  variety  of  topics  is  much  more  promising  than 
focusing on just one application domain.  
After  finishing  the  online  pre-surveys,  37  minutes  remained  for 
the Big Data activity prototype. Students were paired at computers  

 

 

Figure 1. Example visual subset of the fish database 

equipped  with  screen  capture  and  video  recording  for  future 
analysis.  In  the  activity,  students  progressed  through  a  written 
narrative  in  which  they  took  on  the  role  of  computer  scientists 
sent to rescue an underwater research station in distress. As part of 
the adventure, they had to locate a file for a particular fish species 
within a massive fish database. The activity guides students step-
by-step  through  a  skip  list  search  algorithm.  Figure  1  shows  an 
example subset of the fish database from the learning activity. 
Skip  lists,  widely  used  in  Big  Data  applications,  provide  an 
excellent  context  for  teaching  about  data  representation  and 
algorithms.  While  the  final  curriculum  will  include  many  other 
Big  Data  learning  activities  that  convey  the  excitement  and 
conceptual  value  of  Big  Data  (building  upon  the  success  of 
activities  piloted  elsewhere  [7]),  this  particular  Big  Data  pilot 
activity aimed to explore how Big Data applications can provide 
the framework for addressing other CS Principles Big Ideas, such 
as  computing  as  a  creative  activity  (Big  Idea  1)  and  algorithms 
(Big Idea 4). Using a slightly larger subset of the database than 
the one illustrated in Figure 1, students were tasked with finding 
the  shortest  path  to  various  target  fish.  The  activity  scaffolded 
students  through  each  step  of  the  skip  list  algorithm,  using  the 
visual subset of the database. After mastering the searching task 
manually on that concretely depicted subset, students then used a 
visual interface (simulating the visual programming language we 
will use in the ENGAGE game) to arrange pseudo-code blocks into 
a program that could traverse the entire database to find a desired 
fish  (in  this  case,  Surgeonfish).  An  ideal  algorithmic  solution  is 
shown in Figure 2. As described in the next section, this first Big 
Data activity is designed to occupy one entire classroom session 
of approximately 50 minutes.  
The  post-survey  included  a  User  Engagement  Scale  [19]  that 
measured involvement with the activity, focused attention, and the 
student’s desire to repeat a similar activity in the future. Overall, 
students agreed with the item, “I felt involved with this activity” 
(3.9  out  of  5;  SD  =  0.9),  and  generally  disagreed  with,  “I  felt 
discouraged while doing this activity” (1.9 out of 5; SD = 1.0). In 
contrast  to  these overall  positive ratings, there  was one African-

lower  feeling  of 

American  female  student  who  responded  with  a  2  for  “I  felt 
involved with the activity”, and with a 4 for  “I  felt discouraged 
while  doing  this  activity”.  Among  all  the  students  in  the  study, 
this  student  had  demonstrated  the  greatest  interest  in  social 
networking,  with  lower  stated  interest  in  marine  life,  possibly 
explaining  her 
involvement  and  higher 
discouragement with the marine life Big Data activity. As will be 
described  in  Section  5.2,  this  student  later  made  contributions 
during the later focus group that shed light on her experience.  
Overall, students rated, “This activity was fun” with 2.8 out of 5 
SD  =  1.3),  lower  than  hoped.  Because  the  prototype  activity  is 
being  developed  for  use  within  ENGAGE’s  game-based  learning 
environment,  fun  is  an  important  emphasis.  Upon  reflection,  we 
believe that the pace of the learning activity (with several minutes 
elapsing between achievements on the task) may have hindered a 
sense  of  fun,  which  will  be  addressed  in  future  iterations.  It  is 
important  that  students  frequently  feel  a  sense  of  achievement, 
even if the successes represent incremental steps toward the larger 
goal.  Also  providing  helpful  feedback,  students did  not  disagree 
with “I found this activity to be confusing” (3.2 out of 5; SD = 
1.1), indicating room for improvement on the scaffolding. Based 
on all of the students’ feedback, we designed session 2 of the pilot 
study, which was held one week later. 
4.2  Session 2: Focus Groups 
Of  the  original  15  students,  11  returned  the  next  week  for  the 
second session, joined by three new students. As with Session 1, 
all students were in 6th and 7th grades. The demographics for the 
second session were as follows: 12 female and 2 male; 3 white, 6 
African-American,  1  Latino,  1  Native  American,  1  Indian,  1 
Middle  Eastern,  and  1  multiracial  student.  The  students  were 
separated  into  three  focus  groups  of  four  or  five  students  per 
group,  each  facilitated  by  a  member  of  the  research  team.  Each 
group spent roughly 15 minutes discussing students’ conceptions 
of  computer  science  and  programming,  and  then  15  minutes  on 
data. A series of follow-up activities to the previous session’s Big 
Data  activity  were  then  done  in  groups,  with  the  new  students 
paired up with students who had attended the previous week. The 
general purpose of these focus groups was to get student feedback 
on  what  works  and  what  needs  improvement  in  our  Big  Data 
curriculum.  Particular  attention  was  paid  to  eliciting  feedback 
from  students  who  reported  negative  opinions  on  the  Big  Data 
activity in session 1. 
As  predicted,  students  had  a  limited  understanding  of  what  Big 
Data  might  be.  They  could  discuss  data  on  a  smaller  scale, 
describing it as information that you can get and store: “anything 
you  want  to  keep  over  a  long  time.”  They  were  familiar  with 
examples  of  data  in  science,  such  as  weather  patterns  or  plant 
biology, and some saw the purpose of data being “to do a science 
project.”  Although  they  seemed  not  to  have  given  much  prior 
thought to other issues related to data, some students got excited 
thinking  about  the  topic.  When  asked  about  data  storage,  one 
group  of  female  students  interpreted  this  question  in  terms  of 
communication 
their 
conversation. 
 
Facilitator: Where is data stored? 
Student 1:  On the ground, on a paper, you can put it anywhere. 
Student 2:  You could put it on the back of a spaghetti can. 
Facilitator: Yes you could, but would it be helpful there? 
Student 3:  You could put [the spaghetti can] in the pantry. 
Student 2: Like a community pantry.

When  considered  in  light  of  CS  Principles  Learning  Objectives 
3.1.2  and  3.1.3  (Table  2),  the  above  dialogue  illustrates  the 
potential of data to be socially relevant, a key concern for girls in 
computer science. Following up on this finding, we also prompted 
the  students  to  think  about  data  for  social  networking.  Most 
students  had  never  previously  given  thought  to  data  outside  of 
science domains, but even students who had been quiet up to this 
point in the focus group expressed interest in these examples of 
data in their everyday lives. 
After  discussing  computer  science,  programming  and  data, 
students  collaboratively  worked  on  a  series  of  short  activities 
related to the Big Data activity from the session 1. Like that prior 
activity, these were prototypes of activities being considered for 
ENGAGE’s game-based learning environment. Consequently, they 
were presented as elements of the game’s story, with students told 
that their feedback would influence the development of the game. 
In designing these activities, we aimed to improve on the design 
of the activity from session 1, such as by decreasing the amount of 
reading  required.  We  also  sought  to  obtain  student  feedback  on 
Big Data applications that convey the full power and conceptual 
value  of  Big  Data.  Overall,  students  were  noticeably  engaged 
during this session. It included an activity involving cryptography, 
previously used for engaging middle school students in computer 
science [3], and a problem in which students solved a mystery by 
examining clusters of marine data to track a leaked pollutant.  
The post-survey revealed that students felt more positively about 
the activities in this session than they did about the activity from 
session 1. Students rated these activities highly for “fun” (4.1 out 
of 5; SD = 0.8) and low for “confusing” (2.1 out of 5; SD = 0.8). 
Feedback  was  also  more  consistently  positive,  including  for  the 
African-American female student reporting negative feelings after 
session 1 (see Section 5.1). During the discussion, she advocated 
for  including  social  networking  features  in  the  ENGAGE  game, 
particularly the ability to chat with other players: “Everyone likes 
chatting.”  Similar  to  the  conversation  in  Figure  3,  this  student’s 
comments  highlight  the  importance  of  communication  and 
collaboration,  two  of  the  Learning  Objectives  for  CS  Principles 
Big  Idea  3  (Table  2).  While  the  improved  positivity  may  be 
partially  explained  by  repeated  exposure  to  the  topic,  bringing 
greater levels of comfort, it also confirms the notion expressed by 
the  classroom  teachers  in  our  focus  groups:  a  middle  school 
curriculum can benefit from including activities that are relevant 
to students’ everyday lives.  
5.  CONCLUSION  
A curriculum based on Computer Science Principles holds great 
promise for middle school, and the CS Principles related to Big 
Data may be particularly well suited for this age group. We have 
presented  a  case  for  teaching  Big  Data  including  its  strong 
alignment  with  standard  U.S.  curricula  including  the  Common 
Core  and  the  Next  Generation Science  Standards.  We  have  also 
presented  results  from  classroom  teacher  focus  groups  that 
suggest Big Data can serve to enrich core subject matter including 
science, mathematics, and language arts. Lastly, we examined the 
findings  of  a  small  pilot  study  with  middle  school  students  that 
yielded several important lessons for refining the curriculum and 
learning tasks. First, although we created a learning activity with 
distinct subtasks, breaking these down even further and providing 
incremental  achievements  along  the  way  may  increase  students’ 
sense of fun and decrease confusion. Second, including a variety 
of  application  domains  can  strategically engage a  broader  set  of 
learners  with  the  Big  Data  activities.  Finally,  focus  group 
feedback indicates that students may intuitively gravitate toward 

 

seeing  the  importance  of  communication  and  collaboration,  and 
that  these  facets  may  be  particularly  beneficial  to  emphasize  in 
Big Data activities for middle school. 
To  continue  creating  a  successful  CS  Principles-based  Big  Data 
curriculum for middle school, several directions are important to 
future  work.  Teacher  professional  development  at  the  middle 
school  level  is  key,  as  computer  science  and  Big  Data  are  new 
topics  for  most  teachers  who  might  implement  the  curriculum. 
Additionally,  it  is  important  to  develop  formal  CS  Principles-
related learning trajectories that map from high school to middle 
school  and  eventually  to  elementary  school.  Finally,  it  is  hoped 
that  as  part  of  a  broader  effort  to  bring  CS  Principles-based 
curricula  to  middle  school,  this  work  can  substantially  increase 
access to, and interest in, computer science for K-12 learners.
