Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for

systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A
research and education are identified.  We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications.
Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the
proposed BI&A research framework.

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and

has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-

analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

1172

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data

opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,

and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A
research and education are identified.  We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications.
Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the
proposed BI&A research framework.

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

1168

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few
business school journals also contain related BI&A research
in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with
several others from the related fields of marketing, manage-

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A
research and education are identified.  We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications.
Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the
proposed BI&A research framework.

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

work.  Journals are somewhat more limited in their publi-
cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few
business school journals also contain related BI&A research
in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with
several others from the related fields of marketing, manage-
ment,  communication,  and  mathematics.    Many  of  these
authors are close collaborators, for example, Hsinchun Chen
(#1),  Jay  F.  Nunamaker  (#18),  Michael  Chau  (#11),  and

We also report the PageRank score (Brin and Page 1998), a
popular metric for data and network analytics, for the BI&A
authors  based  on  the  coauthorship  network  within  BI&A
publications.  A higher PageRank score captures an author’s
propensity to collaborate with other prolific authors.  The

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A
research and education are identified.  We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications.
Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the
proposed BI&A research framework.

Keywords:  Business intelligence and  analytics, big data analytics, Web 2.0

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

work.  Journals are somewhat more limited in their publi-
cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few
business school journals also contain related BI&A research
in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with
several others from the related fields of marketing, manage-
ment,  communication,  and  mathematics.    Many  of  these
authors are close collaborators, for example, Hsinchun Chen
(#1),  Jay  F.  Nunamaker  (#18),  Michael  Chau  (#11),  and

analysis  reveals broad and even contribution of authors from
North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, reflecting the
diversity and international interest in the field of BI&A.

The  last  set  of  analyses  investigated  the  content  of  BI&A
publications from 2000–2011.  Mallet (McCallum 2002), a
Java-based open-source NLP text analytics tool, was used to
extract the top bigrams (two-word phrases) for each year.  A
few bi-grams were combined to form more meaningful BI-

related trigrams such as “customer relation management” and
“enterprise resource planning.”  These keywords were then
ranked based on their frequency, and the top 30 keywords
displayed using the tagcloud visualization.  More important
keywords  are  highlighted  with  larger  fonts  as  shown  in
Figure 3.  For example, competitive advantage, big data, data
warehousing, and decision support emerged as the top four
topics in the BI&A literature.  Other BI&A related topics such
as customer relation management, data mining, competitive

intelligence,  enterprise  resource  planning,  and  knowledge
management were also highly ranked.  Overall, the topics
extracted were highly relevant to BI&A, especially for its
managerial  and  application  values,  although  most  of  the
detailed technical terms, as described in the previous research
framework sections, were not present.  This could be attri-
buted to the tendency of authors to use broad terminologies in
article titles and abstracts.

BI&A Education and Program
Development

BI&A provides opportunities not only for the research com-
munity, but also for education and program development.  In
July  2012,  Columbia  University  and  New  York  City
announced plans to invest over $80 million dollars in a new
Center  for  Data  Science,  which  is  expected  to  generate
thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenues from
100 startup companies over the next 10 years  (Associated
Press 2012).  BI&A is data science in business.  Job postings
seeking  data  scientists  and  business  analytics  specialists
abound these days.  There is a clear shortage of professionals
with the “deep” knowledge required to manage the three V’s
of big data:  volume, velocity, and variety (Russom 2011).
There is also an increasing demand for individuals with the
deep knowledge needed to manage the three “perspectives” of
business decision making:  descriptive, predictive, and pre-
scriptive analytics.  In this section, we describe BI&A educa-
tion  in  business  schools,  present  the  challenges  facing  IS
departments, and discuss BI&A program development oppor-
tunities.  We also provide some suggestions for the IS disci-
pline in addressing these challenges (Chiang et al. 2012).

1182

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Education Challenges

BI&A focuses on understanding, interpretation, strategizing,
and taking action to further organizational interests.  Several
academic disciplines have contributed to BI&A, including IS,
CS, Statistics, Management, and Marketing, as shown in our
bibliometric study.  IS programs, in particular, are uniquely
positioned to train a new generation of scholars and students
due to their emphasis on key data management and infor-
mation technologies, business-oriented statistical analysis and
management science techniques, and broad business disci-
pline exposure (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Marketing, and
Economics).

Since  its  inception  approximately  45  years  ago,  IS  as  an
academic discipline has primarily focused on business needs
in an era when the major challenges involved the management
of internal business and transaction data.  In the age of big
data, these problems remain, but the emphasis in industry has
shifted to data analysis and rapid business decision making
based on huge volumes of information.  Such time-critical
decision making largely takes place outside of the IS function
(i.e.,  in  business  units  such  as  marketing,  finance,  and
logistics).  Can IS programs serve the needs of these business
decision makers?  Can we provide courses in data mining,
text mining, opinion mining, social media/network analytics,
web  mining,  and  predictive  analytics  that  are  required  for
marketing and finance majors?  We should also ask ourselves
about the skill sets needed by students.  Should we recruit
students with strong math and statistical skills, for example?
We contend that a new vision for IS, or at least for some IS
programs, should address these questions.

BI&A presents a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools to position themselves as a viable option  for edu-

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A
research and education are identified.  We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications.
Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the
proposed BI&A research framework.

Keywords:  Business intelligence and  analytics, big data analytics, Web 2.0

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012 

1167

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

work.  Journals are somewhat more limited in their publi-
cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few
business school journals also contain related BI&A research
in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with

analysis  reveals broad and even contribution of authors from
North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, reflecting the
diversity and international interest in the field of BI&A.

The  last  set  of  analyses  investigated  the  content  of  BI&A
publications from 2000–2011.  Mallet (McCallum 2002), a
Java-based open-source NLP text analytics tool, was used to
extract the top bigrams (two-word phrases) for each year.  A
few bi-grams were combined to form more meaningful BI-

related trigrams such as “customer relation management” and
“enterprise resource planning.”  These keywords were then
ranked based on their frequency, and the top 30 keywords
displayed using the tagcloud visualization.  More important
keywords  are  highlighted  with  larger  fonts  as  shown  in
Figure 3.  For example, competitive advantage, big data, data
warehousing, and decision support emerged as the top four
topics in the BI&A literature.  Other BI&A related topics such
as customer relation management, data mining, competitive

intelligence,  enterprise  resource  planning,  and  knowledge
management were also highly ranked.  Overall, the topics
extracted were highly relevant to BI&A, especially for its
managerial  and  application  values,  although  most  of  the
detailed technical terms, as described in the previous research
framework sections, were not present.  This could be attri-
buted to the tendency of authors to use broad terminologies in
article titles and abstracts.

BI&A Education and Program
Development

BI&A provides opportunities not only for the research com-
munity, but also for education and program development.  In
July  2012,  Columbia  University  and  New  York  City
announced plans to invest over $80 million dollars in a new
Center  for  Data  Science,  which  is  expected  to  generate
thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenues from
100 startup companies over the next 10 years  (Associated
Press 2012).  BI&A is data science in business.  Job postings
seeking  data  scientists  and  business  analytics  specialists
abound these days.  There is a clear shortage of professionals
with the “deep” knowledge required to manage the three V’s
of big data:  volume, velocity, and variety (Russom 2011).
There is also an increasing demand for individuals with the
deep knowledge needed to manage the three “perspectives” of
business decision making:  descriptive, predictive, and pre-
scriptive analytics.  In this section, we describe BI&A educa-
tion  in  business  schools,  present  the  challenges  facing  IS
departments, and discuss BI&A program development oppor-
tunities.  We also provide some suggestions for the IS disci-
pline in addressing these challenges (Chiang et al. 2012).

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Education Challenges

BI&A focuses on understanding, interpretation, strategizing,
and taking action to further organizational interests.  Several
academic disciplines have contributed to BI&A, including IS,
CS, Statistics, Management, and Marketing, as shown in our
bibliometric study.  IS programs, in particular, are uniquely
positioned to train a new generation of scholars and students
due to their emphasis on key data management and infor-
mation technologies, business-oriented statistical analysis and
management science techniques, and broad business disci-
pline exposure (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Marketing, and
Economics).

Since  its  inception  approximately  45  years  ago,  IS  as  an
academic discipline has primarily focused on business needs
in an era when the major challenges involved the management
of internal business and transaction data.  In the age of big
data, these problems remain, but the emphasis in industry has
shifted to data analysis and rapid business decision making
based on huge volumes of information.  Such time-critical
decision making largely takes place outside of the IS function
(i.e.,  in  business  units  such  as  marketing,  finance,  and
logistics).  Can IS programs serve the needs of these business
decision makers?  Can we provide courses in data mining,
text mining, opinion mining, social media/network analytics,
web  mining,  and  predictive  analytics  that  are  required  for
marketing and finance majors?  We should also ask ourselves
about the skill sets needed by students.  Should we recruit
students with strong math and statistical skills, for example?
We contend that a new vision for IS, or at least for some IS
programs, should address these questions.

BI&A presents a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools to position themselves as a viable option  for edu-

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

cating professionals with the necessary depth and academic
rigor to tackle the increased complexity of BI&A issues.  IS
programs housed within business schools have access to a
variety of business courses, as well as courses intended to
improve communication and presentation skills.  It is also
common for business schools to house management science
and statistics faculty in the same IS unit.

BI&A Knowledge and Skills

BI&A education should be interdisciplinary and cover critical
analytical and IT skills, business and domain knowledge, and
communication  skills  required  in  a  complex  data-centric
business environment.

Analytical and IT skills include a variety of evolving topics. 
They  are  drawn  from  disciplines  such  as  statistics  and
computer science for managing and analyzing both structured
data and unstructured text.  Coverage of these topics ranges
from  BI&A  1.0  to  BI&A  3.0.    The  academic  programs
intended  to  produce  BI&A  professionals  should  consider
these analytical and IT skills as suggested in Table 3 of our
research framework.

To provide useful insights and decision-making support, the
BI&A professionals must be capable of understanding the
business issues and framing the appropriate analytical solu-
tions.  The necessary business knowledge for BI&A profes-
sionals  ranges  from  general  familiarity  with  the  areas  of
Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Logistics, and
Operation Management, to the domain knowledge required in
specific  BI&A  applications,  some  of  which  are  discussed
earlier and summarized in Table 2.

The importance of an organization-wide culture for informed
fact-based decision making for business analytics is empha-
sized by Davenport (2006).  To support such a culture, BI&A
professionals need to know not only how to turn raw data and
information (through analytics) into meaningful and action-
able knowledge for an organization, but also how to properly
interact with and communicate this knowledge to the business
and domain experts of the organization.

Program Development

BI&A provides a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools  to  develop  new  courses,  certificate  programs,  and
degree programs charged with preparing the next generation
of analytical thinkers.  There are many options for delivering
BI&A  education.    Because  of  the  depth  of  knowledge
required, graduate programs are the obvious choice.  Viable

The  first  option  requires  the  effort  of  developing  a  new
program.  A few universities have embarked on this endeavor.
A nonexhaustive list includes North Carolina State Univer-
sity, Saint Joseph’s University, Northwestern University, the
University of Denver, Stevens Institute of Technology, and
Fordham University.  New York University will launch its
new program in May 2013.  New MS degree programs can be
designed explicitly to attract analytically strong students with
undergraduate degrees in areas such as mathematics, science,
and  computer  science,  and  to  prepare  these  students  for
careers, not only in the IS or IT groups in industry, but also in
functional areas such as research and development, marketing,
media, logistics, and finance.

The second option leverages existing MS IS programs with a
BI&A  concentration  that  would  supplement  the  already
existing curriculum in IT, data management, and business and
communication courses with additional analytics coverage. 
This  option  has  been  adopted  by  a  number  of  schools
including the IS departments at Carnegie Mellon University
and the University of Arizona.  This option provides BI&A
knowledge  and  skills  for  students  who  will  primarily  find
careers in IS groups in industry.

For working IT professionals who wish to expand into BI&A,
a part-time MS or certificate program (the third option) offer
practical and valid alternatives.  These certificate programs
can be delivered online or on-site and need to provide the
skills that will complement the current IT or business experi-
ence of IT professionals, and/or provide technical and analy-
tical skills to business professionals in non-IT areas.  Online
programs that are currently available include Northwestern
University’s MS in Predictive Analytics and Stanford Univer-
sity’s Graduate Certificate on Mining Big Data.  In addition,
IS programs can help design a BI&A concentration in MBA
programs  to  help  train  a  new  generation  of  data-  and
analytics-savvy managers.

A  key  to  success  for  a  BI&A  program  is  to  integrate  the
concept of “learning by doing” in the BI&A curriculum via
hands-on projects, internships, and industry-guided practicum. 
Big  data  analytics  requires  trial-and-error  and  experimen-
tation.  Strong relationships and partnerships between aca-
demic programs and industry partners are critical to foster the
experiential learning aspect of the BI&A curriculum.

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

work.  Journals are somewhat more limited in their publi-
cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few
business school journals also contain related BI&A research
in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with
several others from the related fields of marketing, manage-
ment,  communication,  and  mathematics.    Many  of  these
authors are close collaborators, for example, Hsinchun Chen
(#1),  Jay  F.  Nunamaker  (#18),  Michael  Chau  (#11),  and

analysis  reveals broad and even contribution of authors from
North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, reflecting the
diversity and international interest in the field of BI&A.

The  last  set  of  analyses  investigated  the  content  of  BI&A
publications from 2000–2011.  Mallet (McCallum 2002), a
Java-based open-source NLP text analytics tool, was used to
extract the top bigrams (two-word phrases) for each year.  A
few bi-grams were combined to form more meaningful BI-

related trigrams such as “customer relation management” and
“enterprise resource planning.”  These keywords were then
ranked based on their frequency, and the top 30 keywords
displayed using the tagcloud visualization.  More important
keywords  are  highlighted  with  larger  fonts  as  shown  in
Figure 3.  For example, competitive advantage, big data, data
warehousing, and decision support emerged as the top four
topics in the BI&A literature.  Other BI&A related topics such
as customer relation management, data mining, competitive

intelligence,  enterprise  resource  planning,  and  knowledge
management were also highly ranked.  Overall, the topics
extracted were highly relevant to BI&A, especially for its
managerial  and  application  values,  although  most  of  the
detailed technical terms, as described in the previous research
framework sections, were not present.  This could be attri-
buted to the tendency of authors to use broad terminologies in
article titles and abstracts.

BI&A Education and Program
Development

BI&A provides opportunities not only for the research com-
munity, but also for education and program development.  In
July  2012,  Columbia  University  and  New  York  City
announced plans to invest over $80 million dollars in a new
Center  for  Data  Science,  which  is  expected  to  generate
thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenues from
100 startup companies over the next 10 years  (Associated
Press 2012).  BI&A is data science in business.  Job postings
seeking  data  scientists  and  business  analytics  specialists
abound these days.  There is a clear shortage of professionals
with the “deep” knowledge required to manage the three V’s
of big data:  volume, velocity, and variety (Russom 2011).
There is also an increasing demand for individuals with the
deep knowledge needed to manage the three “perspectives” of
business decision making:  descriptive, predictive, and pre-
scriptive analytics.  In this section, we describe BI&A educa-
tion  in  business  schools,  present  the  challenges  facing  IS
departments, and discuss BI&A program development oppor-
tunities.  We also provide some suggestions for the IS disci-
pline in addressing these challenges (Chiang et al. 2012).

Education Challenges

BI&A focuses on understanding, interpretation, strategizing,
and taking action to further organizational interests.  Several
academic disciplines have contributed to BI&A, including IS,
CS, Statistics, Management, and Marketing, as shown in our
bibliometric study.  IS programs, in particular, are uniquely
positioned to train a new generation of scholars and students
due to their emphasis on key data management and infor-
mation technologies, business-oriented statistical analysis and
management science techniques, and broad business disci-
pline exposure (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Marketing, and
Economics).

Since  its  inception  approximately  45  years  ago,  IS  as  an
academic discipline has primarily focused on business needs
in an era when the major challenges involved the management
of internal business and transaction data.  In the age of big
data, these problems remain, but the emphasis in industry has
shifted to data analysis and rapid business decision making
based on huge volumes of information.  Such time-critical
decision making largely takes place outside of the IS function
(i.e.,  in  business  units  such  as  marketing,  finance,  and
logistics).  Can IS programs serve the needs of these business
decision makers?  Can we provide courses in data mining,
text mining, opinion mining, social media/network analytics,
web  mining,  and  predictive  analytics  that  are  required  for
marketing and finance majors?  We should also ask ourselves
about the skill sets needed by students.  Should we recruit
students with strong math and statistical skills, for example?
We contend that a new vision for IS, or at least for some IS
programs, should address these questions.

BI&A presents a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools to position themselves as a viable option  for edu-

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

cating professionals with the necessary depth and academic
rigor to tackle the increased complexity of BI&A issues.  IS
programs housed within business schools have access to a
variety of business courses, as well as courses intended to
improve communication and presentation skills.  It is also
common for business schools to house management science
and statistics faculty in the same IS unit.

BI&A Knowledge and Skills

BI&A education should be interdisciplinary and cover critical
analytical and IT skills, business and domain knowledge, and
communication  skills  required  in  a  complex  data-centric
business environment.

Analytical and IT skills include a variety of evolving topics. 
They  are  drawn  from  disciplines  such  as  statistics  and
computer science for managing and analyzing both structured
data and unstructured text.  Coverage of these topics ranges
from  BI&A  1.0  to  BI&A  3.0.    The  academic  programs
intended  to  produce  BI&A  professionals  should  consider
these analytical and IT skills as suggested in Table 3 of our
research framework.

To provide useful insights and decision-making support, the
BI&A professionals must be capable of understanding the
business issues and framing the appropriate analytical solu-
tions.  The necessary business knowledge for BI&A profes-
sionals  ranges  from  general  familiarity  with  the  areas  of
Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Logistics, and
Operation Management, to the domain knowledge required in
specific  BI&A  applications,  some  of  which  are  discussed
earlier and summarized in Table 2.

The importance of an organization-wide culture for informed
fact-based decision making for business analytics is empha-
sized by Davenport (2006).  To support such a culture, BI&A
professionals need to know not only how to turn raw data and
information (through analytics) into meaningful and action-
able knowledge for an organization, but also how to properly
interact with and communicate this knowledge to the business
and domain experts of the organization.

Program Development

BI&A provides a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools  to  develop  new  courses,  certificate  programs,  and
degree programs charged with preparing the next generation
of analytical thinkers.  There are many options for delivering
BI&A  education.    Because  of  the  depth  of  knowledge
required, graduate programs are the obvious choice.  Viable

The  first  option  requires  the  effort  of  developing  a  new
program.  A few universities have embarked on this endeavor.
A nonexhaustive list includes North Carolina State Univer-
sity, Saint Joseph’s University, Northwestern University, the
University of Denver, Stevens Institute of Technology, and
Fordham University.  New York University will launch its
new program in May 2013.  New MS degree programs can be
designed explicitly to attract analytically strong students with
undergraduate degrees in areas such as mathematics, science,
and  computer  science,  and  to  prepare  these  students  for
careers, not only in the IS or IT groups in industry, but also in
functional areas such as research and development, marketing,
media, logistics, and finance.

The second option leverages existing MS IS programs with a
BI&A  concentration  that  would  supplement  the  already
existing curriculum in IT, data management, and business and
communication courses with additional analytics coverage. 
This  option  has  been  adopted  by  a  number  of  schools
including the IS departments at Carnegie Mellon University
and the University of Arizona.  This option provides BI&A
knowledge  and  skills  for  students  who  will  primarily  find
careers in IS groups in industry.

For working IT professionals who wish to expand into BI&A,
a part-time MS or certificate program (the third option) offer
practical and valid alternatives.  These certificate programs
can be delivered online or on-site and need to provide the
skills that will complement the current IT or business experi-
ence of IT professionals, and/or provide technical and analy-
tical skills to business professionals in non-IT areas.  Online
programs that are currently available include Northwestern
University’s MS in Predictive Analytics and Stanford Univer-
sity’s Graduate Certificate on Mining Big Data.  In addition,
IS programs can help design a BI&A concentration in MBA
programs  to  help  train  a  new  generation  of  data-  and
analytics-savvy managers.

A  key  to  success  for  a  BI&A  program  is  to  integrate  the
concept of “learning by doing” in the BI&A curriculum via
hands-on projects, internships, and industry-guided practicum. 
Big  data  analytics  requires  trial-and-error  and  experimen-
tation.  Strong relationships and partnerships between aca-
demic programs and industry partners are critical to foster the
experiential learning aspect of the BI&A curriculum.

Papers in this Special Issue

The  idea  for  this  special  issue  began  in  May  2009,  when
Detmar Straub, the Editor-in-Chief of MIS Quarterly, soli-
cited suggestions for special issues from the editorial board
members.  We submitted the special issue proposal on Busi-
ness Intelligence Research in August 2009, with the call-for-
papers approved and distributed at the 30th Annual Interna-
tional Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in Decem-
ber of that year.  Submissions to this special issue needed to
relate  to  MIS  Quarterly’s  mission  with  strong  managerial,
organizational, and societal relevance and impact. In addition
to the Design Science approach (Hevner et al. 2004; March &
Storey 2008), rigorous and relevant BI-related research using
management science (modeling, optimization), information
economics, and organizational and behavioral methodologies
(case studies, surveys) was also welcomed.  A total of 62
manuscripts was received by October 2010.  In the following
20 months, six of the manuscripts went through three or four
review rounds and were then accepted for this issue.  

The six papers address various aspects of the BI&A research
framework presented in this introduction paper (see Table 7).
All six papers are based on BI&A 1.0, with three also based
on BI&A 2.0.  The first three papers by Chau and Xu, Park et
al., and Lau et al. focus on BI&A 2.0 with applications on e-
commerce and market intelligence using text, web, and net-
work analytics.  In the next two papers, both Hu et al. and
Abbasi et al. work in the category of BI&A 1.0 with a focus
on  security,  but  Hu  et  al.  use  network  analytics  whereas
Abbasi et al. emphasize security analysis and data analytics. 
Finally, Sahoo et al. also work in BI&A 1.0, with direct appli-
cation to e-commerce and market intelligence using web and
data analytics.

In “Business Intelligence in Blogs:  Understanding Consumer
Interactions and Communities,” Michael Chau and Jennifer
Xu recognized the potential “gold mine” of blog content for
business  intelligence  and  developed  a  framework  for
gathering business intelligence by automatically collecting
and  analyzing  blog  content  and  bloggers’  interaction  net-
works.    A  system  developed  using  this  framework  was
applied to two case studies, which revealed novel patterns in
blogger interactions and communities.

Sung-Hyuk Park, Soon-Young Huh, Wonseok Oh, and Sang
Pil Han in their paper, “A Social Network-Based Inference
Model for Validating Customer Profile Data,” argue that busi-
ness intelligence systems are of limited value when they deal
with inaccurate and unreliable data.  The authors proposed a
social network-driven inference framework to determine the
accuracy  and  reliability  of  self-reported  customer  profiles.
The  framework  utilized  the  individuals’  social  circles  and

1184

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

communication patterns within their circles.  To construct the
specific  inference  and  validation  model,  a  combination  of
methods  was  used,  including  query  processing,  statistical
inference, social network analysis, and user profiling.  The
authors analyzed over 20 million actual mobile call trans-
actions  and  their  proposed  social  network-based  inference
model consistently outperformed the alternative approaches.

In “Web 2.0 Environmental Scanning and Adaptive Decision
Support for Business Mergers and Acquisitions,” Raymond
Lau, Stephen Liao, K. F. Wong, and Dickson Chiu analyzed
company mergers and acquisitions (M&A).  Online environ-
mental scanning with Web 2.0 provides top executives with
opportunities to tap into collective web intelligence to develop
better insights about the socio-cultural and political-economic
factors that cross-border M&As face.  Grounded on Porter’s
five  forces  model,  this  research  designed  a  due  diligence
scorecard model that leverages collective web intelligence to
enhance M&A decision making.  The authors also developed
an adaptive business intelligence (BI) 2.0 system, which they
applied to Chinese companies’ cross-border M&A activities.

In their paper, “Network-Based Modeling and Analysis of
Systemic  Risk  in  Banking  Systems,”  Daning  Hu,  J.  Leon
Zhao, Zhimin Hua, and Michael Wong analyzed systemic risk
in banking systems by treating banks as a network linked with
financial relationships, leading to a network approach to risk
management (NARM).  The authors used NARM to analyze
systemic risk attributed to each individual bank via simulation
based on real-world data from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  NARM  offered  a  new  means  by  which  con-
tagious bank failures could be predicted and capital injection
priorities at the individual bank level could be determined in
the wake of a financial crisis.  A simulation study showed
that, under significant market shocks, the interbank payment
links  became  more  influential  than  the  correlated  bank
portfolio links in determining an individual bank’s survival.

Ahmed Abbasi, Conan Albrecht, Anthony Vance, and James
Hansen in their paper, “MetaFraud:  A Meta-Learning Frame-
work  for  Detecting  Financial  Fraud,”  employed  a  design
science  approach  to  develop  MetaFraud,  a  meta-learning
framework for enhanced financial fraud detection.  A series
of experiments was conducted on thousands of legitimate and
fraudulent firms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the frame-
work over existing benchmark methods.  The research results
have  implications  for  compliance  officers,  investors,  audit
firms, and regulators.

The paper by Nachiketa Sahoo, Param Vir Singh, and Tridas
Mukhopadhyay, “A Hidden Markov Model for Collaborative
Filtering,”  reports  on  the  analysis  of  making  personalized
recommendations when user preferences are changing.  The

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A
research and education are identified.  We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications.
Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the
proposed BI&A research framework.

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

work.  Journals are somewhat more limited in their publi-
cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few
business school journals also contain related BI&A research
in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with
several others from the related fields of marketing, manage-
ment,  communication,  and  mathematics.    Many  of  these
authors are close collaborators, for example, Hsinchun Chen
(#1),  Jay  F.  Nunamaker  (#18),  Michael  Chau  (#11),  and
Wingyan  Chung  (#18)  through  the  University  of  Arizona
connection,11  and  Barabara  H.  Wixom  (#5)  and  Hugh  J.
Watson (#5) through the University of Georgia connection.
We also report the PageRank score (Brin and Page 1998), a
popular metric for data and network analytics, for the BI&A
authors  based  on  the  coauthorship  network  within  BI&A
publications.  A higher PageRank score captures an author’s
propensity to collaborate with other prolific authors.  The

analysis  reveals broad and even contribution of authors from
North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, reflecting the
diversity and international interest in the field of BI&A.

The  last  set  of  analyses  investigated  the  content  of  BI&A
publications from 2000–2011.  Mallet (McCallum 2002), a
Java-based open-source NLP text analytics tool, was used to
extract the top bigrams (two-word phrases) for each year.  A
few bi-grams were combined to form more meaningful BI-

related trigrams such as “customer relation management” and
“enterprise resource planning.”  These keywords were then
ranked based on their frequency, and the top 30 keywords
displayed using the tagcloud visualization.  More important
keywords  are  highlighted  with  larger  fonts  as  shown  in
Figure 3.  For example, competitive advantage, big data, data
warehousing, and decision support emerged as the top four
topics in the BI&A literature.  Other BI&A related topics such
as customer relation management, data mining, competitive

intelligence,  enterprise  resource  planning,  and  knowledge
management were also highly ranked.  Overall, the topics
extracted were highly relevant to BI&A, especially for its
managerial  and  application  values,  although  most  of  the
detailed technical terms, as described in the previous research
framework sections, were not present.  This could be attri-
buted to the tendency of authors to use broad terminologies in
article titles and abstracts.

BI&A Education and Program
Development

BI&A provides opportunities not only for the research com-
munity, but also for education and program development.  In
July  2012,  Columbia  University  and  New  York  City
announced plans to invest over $80 million dollars in a new
Center  for  Data  Science,  which  is  expected  to  generate
thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenues from
100 startup companies over the next 10 years  (Associated
Press 2012).  BI&A is data science in business.  Job postings
seeking  data  scientists  and  business  analytics  specialists
abound these days.  There is a clear shortage of professionals
with the “deep” knowledge required to manage the three V’s
of big data:  volume, velocity, and variety (Russom 2011).
There is also an increasing demand for individuals with the
deep knowledge needed to manage the three “perspectives” of
business decision making:  descriptive, predictive, and pre-
scriptive analytics.  In this section, we describe BI&A educa-
tion  in  business  schools,  present  the  challenges  facing  IS
departments, and discuss BI&A program development oppor-
tunities.  We also provide some suggestions for the IS disci-
pline in addressing these challenges (Chiang et al. 2012).

1182

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Education Challenges

BI&A focuses on understanding, interpretation, strategizing,
and taking action to further organizational interests.  Several
academic disciplines have contributed to BI&A, including IS,
CS, Statistics, Management, and Marketing, as shown in our
bibliometric study.  IS programs, in particular, are uniquely
positioned to train a new generation of scholars and students
due to their emphasis on key data management and infor-
mation technologies, business-oriented statistical analysis and
management science techniques, and broad business disci-
pline exposure (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Marketing, and
Economics).

Since  its  inception  approximately  45  years  ago,  IS  as  an
academic discipline has primarily focused on business needs
in an era when the major challenges involved the management
of internal business and transaction data.  In the age of big
data, these problems remain, but the emphasis in industry has
shifted to data analysis and rapid business decision making
based on huge volumes of information.  Such time-critical
decision making largely takes place outside of the IS function
(i.e.,  in  business  units  such  as  marketing,  finance,  and
logistics).  Can IS programs serve the needs of these business
decision makers?  Can we provide courses in data mining,
text mining, opinion mining, social media/network analytics,
web  mining,  and  predictive  analytics  that  are  required  for
marketing and finance majors?  We should also ask ourselves
about the skill sets needed by students.  Should we recruit
students with strong math and statistical skills, for example?
We contend that a new vision for IS, or at least for some IS
programs, should address these questions.

BI&A presents a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools to position themselves as a viable option  for edu-

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

cating professionals with the necessary depth and academic
rigor to tackle the increased complexity of BI&A issues.  IS
programs housed within business schools have access to a
variety of business courses, as well as courses intended to
improve communication and presentation skills.  It is also
common for business schools to house management science
and statistics faculty in the same IS unit.

BI&A Knowledge and Skills

BI&A education should be interdisciplinary and cover critical
analytical and IT skills, business and domain knowledge, and
communication  skills  required  in  a  complex  data-centric
business environment.

Analytical and IT skills include a variety of evolving topics. 
They  are  drawn  from  disciplines  such  as  statistics  and
computer science for managing and analyzing both structured
data and unstructured text.  Coverage of these topics ranges
from  BI&A  1.0  to  BI&A  3.0.    The  academic  programs
intended  to  produce  BI&A  professionals  should  consider
these analytical and IT skills as suggested in Table 3 of our
research framework.

To provide useful insights and decision-making support, the
BI&A professionals must be capable of understanding the
business issues and framing the appropriate analytical solu-
tions.  The necessary business knowledge for BI&A profes-
sionals  ranges  from  general  familiarity  with  the  areas  of
Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Logistics, and
Operation Management, to the domain knowledge required in
specific  BI&A  applications,  some  of  which  are  discussed
earlier and summarized in Table 2.

The importance of an organization-wide culture for informed
fact-based decision making for business analytics is empha-
sized by Davenport (2006).  To support such a culture, BI&A
professionals need to know not only how to turn raw data and
information (through analytics) into meaningful and action-
able knowledge for an organization, but also how to properly
interact with and communicate this knowledge to the business
and domain experts of the organization.

Program Development

BI&A provides a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools  to  develop  new  courses,  certificate  programs,  and
degree programs charged with preparing the next generation
of analytical thinkers.  There are many options for delivering
BI&A  education.    Because  of  the  depth  of  knowledge
required, graduate programs are the obvious choice.  Viable

The  first  option  requires  the  effort  of  developing  a  new
program.  A few universities have embarked on this endeavor.
A nonexhaustive list includes North Carolina State Univer-
sity, Saint Joseph’s University, Northwestern University, the
University of Denver, Stevens Institute of Technology, and
Fordham University.  New York University will launch its
new program in May 2013.  New MS degree programs can be
designed explicitly to attract analytically strong students with
undergraduate degrees in areas such as mathematics, science,
and  computer  science,  and  to  prepare  these  students  for
careers, not only in the IS or IT groups in industry, but also in
functional areas such as research and development, marketing,
media, logistics, and finance.

The second option leverages existing MS IS programs with a
BI&A  concentration  that  would  supplement  the  already
existing curriculum in IT, data management, and business and
communication courses with additional analytics coverage. 
This  option  has  been  adopted  by  a  number  of  schools
including the IS departments at Carnegie Mellon University
and the University of Arizona.  This option provides BI&A
knowledge  and  skills  for  students  who  will  primarily  find
careers in IS groups in industry.

For working IT professionals who wish to expand into BI&A,
a part-time MS or certificate program (the third option) offer
practical and valid alternatives.  These certificate programs
can be delivered online or on-site and need to provide the
skills that will complement the current IT or business experi-
ence of IT professionals, and/or provide technical and analy-
tical skills to business professionals in non-IT areas.  Online
programs that are currently available include Northwestern
University’s MS in Predictive Analytics and Stanford Univer-
sity’s Graduate Certificate on Mining Big Data.  In addition,
IS programs can help design a BI&A concentration in MBA
programs  to  help  train  a  new  generation  of  data-  and
analytics-savvy managers.

A  key  to  success  for  a  BI&A  program  is  to  integrate  the
concept of “learning by doing” in the BI&A curriculum via
hands-on projects, internships, and industry-guided practicum. 
Big  data  analytics  requires  trial-and-error  and  experimen-
tation.  Strong relationships and partnerships between aca-
demic programs and industry partners are critical to foster the
experiential learning aspect of the BI&A curriculum.

Papers in this Special Issue

The  idea  for  this  special  issue  began  in  May  2009,  when
Detmar Straub, the Editor-in-Chief of MIS Quarterly, soli-
cited suggestions for special issues from the editorial board
members.  We submitted the special issue proposal on Busi-
ness Intelligence Research in August 2009, with the call-for-
papers approved and distributed at the 30th Annual Interna-
tional Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in Decem-
ber of that year.  Submissions to this special issue needed to
relate  to  MIS  Quarterly’s  mission  with  strong  managerial,
organizational, and societal relevance and impact. In addition
to the Design Science approach (Hevner et al. 2004; March &
Storey 2008), rigorous and relevant BI-related research using
management science (modeling, optimization), information
economics, and organizational and behavioral methodologies
(case studies, surveys) was also welcomed.  A total of 62
manuscripts was received by October 2010.  In the following
20 months, six of the manuscripts went through three or four
review rounds and were then accepted for this issue.  

The six papers address various aspects of the BI&A research
framework presented in this introduction paper (see Table 7).
All six papers are based on BI&A 1.0, with three also based
on BI&A 2.0.  The first three papers by Chau and Xu, Park et
al., and Lau et al. focus on BI&A 2.0 with applications on e-
commerce and market intelligence using text, web, and net-
work analytics.  In the next two papers, both Hu et al. and
Abbasi et al. work in the category of BI&A 1.0 with a focus
on  security,  but  Hu  et  al.  use  network  analytics  whereas
Abbasi et al. emphasize security analysis and data analytics. 
Finally, Sahoo et al. also work in BI&A 1.0, with direct appli-
cation to e-commerce and market intelligence using web and
data analytics.

In “Business Intelligence in Blogs:  Understanding Consumer
Interactions and Communities,” Michael Chau and Jennifer
Xu recognized the potential “gold mine” of blog content for
business  intelligence  and  developed  a  framework  for
gathering business intelligence by automatically collecting
and  analyzing  blog  content  and  bloggers’  interaction  net-
works.    A  system  developed  using  this  framework  was
applied to two case studies, which revealed novel patterns in
blogger interactions and communities.

Sung-Hyuk Park, Soon-Young Huh, Wonseok Oh, and Sang
Pil Han in their paper, “A Social Network-Based Inference
Model for Validating Customer Profile Data,” argue that busi-
ness intelligence systems are of limited value when they deal
with inaccurate and unreliable data.  The authors proposed a
social network-driven inference framework to determine the
accuracy  and  reliability  of  self-reported  customer  profiles.
The  framework  utilized  the  individuals’  social  circles  and

1184

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

communication patterns within their circles.  To construct the
specific  inference  and  validation  model,  a  combination  of
methods  was  used,  including  query  processing,  statistical
inference, social network analysis, and user profiling.  The
authors analyzed over 20 million actual mobile call trans-
actions  and  their  proposed  social  network-based  inference
model consistently outperformed the alternative approaches.

In “Web 2.0 Environmental Scanning and Adaptive Decision
Support for Business Mergers and Acquisitions,” Raymond
Lau, Stephen Liao, K. F. Wong, and Dickson Chiu analyzed
company mergers and acquisitions (M&A).  Online environ-
mental scanning with Web 2.0 provides top executives with
opportunities to tap into collective web intelligence to develop
better insights about the socio-cultural and political-economic
factors that cross-border M&As face.  Grounded on Porter’s
five  forces  model,  this  research  designed  a  due  diligence
scorecard model that leverages collective web intelligence to
enhance M&A decision making.  The authors also developed
an adaptive business intelligence (BI) 2.0 system, which they
applied to Chinese companies’ cross-border M&A activities.

In their paper, “Network-Based Modeling and Analysis of
Systemic  Risk  in  Banking  Systems,”  Daning  Hu,  J.  Leon
Zhao, Zhimin Hua, and Michael Wong analyzed systemic risk
in banking systems by treating banks as a network linked with
financial relationships, leading to a network approach to risk
management (NARM).  The authors used NARM to analyze
systemic risk attributed to each individual bank via simulation
based on real-world data from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  NARM  offered  a  new  means  by  which  con-
tagious bank failures could be predicted and capital injection
priorities at the individual bank level could be determined in
the wake of a financial crisis.  A simulation study showed
that, under significant market shocks, the interbank payment
links  became  more  influential  than  the  correlated  bank
portfolio links in determining an individual bank’s survival.

Ahmed Abbasi, Conan Albrecht, Anthony Vance, and James
Hansen in their paper, “MetaFraud:  A Meta-Learning Frame-
work  for  Detecting  Financial  Fraud,”  employed  a  design
science  approach  to  develop  MetaFraud,  a  meta-learning
framework for enhanced financial fraud detection.  A series
of experiments was conducted on thousands of legitimate and
fraudulent firms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the frame-
work over existing benchmark methods.  The research results
have  implications  for  compliance  officers,  investors,  audit
firms, and regulators.

The paper by Nachiketa Sahoo, Param Vir Singh, and Tridas
Mukhopadhyay, “A Hidden Markov Model for Collaborative
Filtering,”  reports  on  the  analysis  of  making  personalized
recommendations when user preferences are changing.  The

there is an advantage to using the proposed algorithm over
existing ones.

Summary and Conclusions

Through BI&A 1.0 initiatives, businesses and organizations
from  all  sectors  began  to  gain  critical  insights  from  the
structured data collected through various enterprise systems
and analyzed by commercial relational database management
systems.  Over the past several years, web intelligence, web
analytics, web 2.0, and the ability to mine unstructured user-
generated contents have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research, leading to unprecedented intelligence on
consumer  opinion,  customer  needs,  and  recognizing  new
business opportunities.  Now, in this era of Big Data, even

while BI&A 2.0 is still maturing, we find ourselves poised at
the brink of BI&A 3.0, with all the attendant uncertainty that
new and potentially revolutionary technologies bring.

This MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence
Research  is  intended  to  serve,  in  part,  as  a  platform  and
conversation guide for examining how the IS discipline can
better serve the needs of business decision makers in light of
maturing and emerging BI&A technologies, ubiquitous Big
Data, and the predicted shortages of data-savvy managers and
of business professionals with deep analytical skills.  How
can academic IS programs continue to meet the needs of their
traditional  students,  while  also  reaching  the  working  IT
professional in need of new analytical skills?  A new vision
for IS may be needed to address this and other questions.

By  highlighting  several  applications  such  as  e-commerce,
market intelligence, e-government, healthcare, and security,
and  by  mapping  important  facets  of  the  current  BI&A
knowledge landscape, we hope to contribute to future sources
of  knowledge  and  to  augment  current  discussions  on  the
importance of (relevant) academic research.

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,

and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

work.  Journals are somewhat more limited in their publi-
cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few
business school journals also contain related BI&A research
in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with
several others from the related fields of marketing, manage-
ment,  communication,  and  mathematics.    Many  of  these
authors are close collaborators, for example, Hsinchun Chen
(#1),  Jay  F.  Nunamaker  (#18),  Michael  Chau  (#11),  and
Wingyan  Chung  (#18)  through  the  University  of  Arizona
connection,11  and  Barabara  H.  Wixom  (#5)  and  Hugh  J.
Watson (#5) through the University of Georgia connection.
We also report the PageRank score (Brin and Page 1998), a
popular metric for data and network analytics, for the BI&A
authors  based  on  the  coauthorship  network  within  BI&A
publications.  A higher PageRank score captures an author’s
propensity to collaborate with other prolific authors.  The

analysis  reveals broad and even contribution of authors from
North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, reflecting the
diversity and international interest in the field of BI&A.

The  last  set  of  analyses  investigated  the  content  of  BI&A
publications from 2000–2011.  Mallet (McCallum 2002), a
Java-based open-source NLP text analytics tool, was used to
extract the top bigrams (two-word phrases) for each year.  A
few bi-grams were combined to form more meaningful BI-

related trigrams such as “customer relation management” and
“enterprise resource planning.”  These keywords were then
ranked based on their frequency, and the top 30 keywords
displayed using the tagcloud visualization.  More important
keywords  are  highlighted  with  larger  fonts  as  shown  in
Figure 3.  For example, competitive advantage, big data, data
warehousing, and decision support emerged as the top four
topics in the BI&A literature.  Other BI&A related topics such
as customer relation management, data mining, competitive

intelligence,  enterprise  resource  planning,  and  knowledge
management were also highly ranked.  Overall, the topics
extracted were highly relevant to BI&A, especially for its
managerial  and  application  values,  although  most  of  the
detailed technical terms, as described in the previous research
framework sections, were not present.  This could be attri-
buted to the tendency of authors to use broad terminologies in
article titles and abstracts.

BI&A Education and Program
Development

BI&A provides opportunities not only for the research com-
munity, but also for education and program development.  In
July  2012,  Columbia  University  and  New  York  City
announced plans to invest over $80 million dollars in a new
Center  for  Data  Science,  which  is  expected  to  generate
thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenues from
100 startup companies over the next 10 years  (Associated
Press 2012).  BI&A is data science in business.  Job postings
seeking  data  scientists  and  business  analytics  specialists
abound these days.  There is a clear shortage of professionals
with the “deep” knowledge required to manage the three V’s
of big data:  volume, velocity, and variety (Russom 2011).
There is also an increasing demand for individuals with the
deep knowledge needed to manage the three “perspectives” of
business decision making:  descriptive, predictive, and pre-
scriptive analytics.  In this section, we describe BI&A educa-
tion  in  business  schools,  present  the  challenges  facing  IS
departments, and discuss BI&A program development oppor-
tunities.  We also provide some suggestions for the IS disci-
pline in addressing these challenges (Chiang et al. 2012).

1182

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Education Challenges

BI&A focuses on understanding, interpretation, strategizing,
and taking action to further organizational interests.  Several
academic disciplines have contributed to BI&A, including IS,
CS, Statistics, Management, and Marketing, as shown in our
bibliometric study.  IS programs, in particular, are uniquely
positioned to train a new generation of scholars and students
due to their emphasis on key data management and infor-
mation technologies, business-oriented statistical analysis and
management science techniques, and broad business disci-
pline exposure (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Marketing, and
Economics).

Since  its  inception  approximately  45  years  ago,  IS  as  an
academic discipline has primarily focused on business needs
in an era when the major challenges involved the management
of internal business and transaction data.  In the age of big
data, these problems remain, but the emphasis in industry has
shifted to data analysis and rapid business decision making
based on huge volumes of information.  Such time-critical
decision making largely takes place outside of the IS function
(i.e.,  in  business  units  such  as  marketing,  finance,  and
logistics).  Can IS programs serve the needs of these business
decision makers?  Can we provide courses in data mining,
text mining, opinion mining, social media/network analytics,
web  mining,  and  predictive  analytics  that  are  required  for
marketing and finance majors?  We should also ask ourselves
about the skill sets needed by students.  Should we recruit
students with strong math and statistical skills, for example?
We contend that a new vision for IS, or at least for some IS
programs, should address these questions.

BI&A presents a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools to position themselves as a viable option  for edu-

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

cating professionals with the necessary depth and academic
rigor to tackle the increased complexity of BI&A issues.  IS
programs housed within business schools have access to a
variety of business courses, as well as courses intended to
improve communication and presentation skills.  It is also
common for business schools to house management science
and statistics faculty in the same IS unit.

program development options in delivering BI&A education

BI&A Knowledge and Skills

BI&A education should be interdisciplinary and cover critical
analytical and IT skills, business and domain knowledge, and
communication  skills  required  in  a  complex  data-centric
business environment.

Analytical and IT skills include a variety of evolving topics. 
They  are  drawn  from  disciplines  such  as  statistics  and
computer science for managing and analyzing both structured
data and unstructured text.  Coverage of these topics ranges
from  BI&A  1.0  to  BI&A  3.0.    The  academic  programs
intended  to  produce  BI&A  professionals  should  consider
these analytical and IT skills as suggested in Table 3 of our
research framework.

To provide useful insights and decision-making support, the
BI&A professionals must be capable of understanding the
business issues and framing the appropriate analytical solu-
tions.  The necessary business knowledge for BI&A profes-
sionals  ranges  from  general  familiarity  with  the  areas  of
Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Logistics, and
Operation Management, to the domain knowledge required in
specific  BI&A  applications,  some  of  which  are  discussed
earlier and summarized in Table 2.

The importance of an organization-wide culture for informed
fact-based decision making for business analytics is empha-
sized by Davenport (2006).  To support such a culture, BI&A
professionals need to know not only how to turn raw data and
information (through analytics) into meaningful and action-
able knowledge for an organization, but also how to properly
interact with and communicate this knowledge to the business
and domain experts of the organization.

Program Development

BI&A provides a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools  to  develop  new  courses,  certificate  programs,  and
degree programs charged with preparing the next generation
of analytical thinkers.  There are many options for delivering
BI&A  education.    Because  of  the  depth  of  knowledge
required, graduate programs are the obvious choice.  Viable

The  first  option  requires  the  effort  of  developing  a  new
program.  A few universities have embarked on this endeavor.
A nonexhaustive list includes North Carolina State Univer-
sity, Saint Joseph’s University, Northwestern University, the
University of Denver, Stevens Institute of Technology, and
Fordham University.  New York University will launch its
new program in May 2013.  New MS degree programs can be
designed explicitly to attract analytically strong students with
undergraduate degrees in areas such as mathematics, science,
and  computer  science,  and  to  prepare  these  students  for
careers, not only in the IS or IT groups in industry, but also in
functional areas such as research and development, marketing,
media, logistics, and finance.

The second option leverages existing MS IS programs with a
BI&A  concentration  that  would  supplement  the  already
existing curriculum in IT, data management, and business and
communication courses with additional analytics coverage. 
This  option  has  been  adopted  by  a  number  of  schools
including the IS departments at Carnegie Mellon University
and the University of Arizona.  This option provides BI&A
knowledge  and  skills  for  students  who  will  primarily  find
careers in IS groups in industry.

For working IT professionals who wish to expand into BI&A,
a part-time MS or certificate program (the third option) offer
practical and valid alternatives.  These certificate programs
can be delivered online or on-site and need to provide the
skills that will complement the current IT or business experi-
ence of IT professionals, and/or provide technical and analy-
tical skills to business professionals in non-IT areas.  Online
programs that are currently available include Northwestern
University’s MS in Predictive Analytics and Stanford Univer-
sity’s Graduate Certificate on Mining Big Data.  In addition,
IS programs can help design a BI&A concentration in MBA
programs  to  help  train  a  new  generation  of  data-  and
analytics-savvy managers.

A  key  to  success  for  a  BI&A  program  is  to  integrate  the
concept of “learning by doing” in the BI&A curriculum via
hands-on projects, internships, and industry-guided practicum. 
Big  data  analytics  requires  trial-and-error  and  experimen-
tation.  Strong relationships and partnerships between aca-
demic programs and industry partners are critical to foster the
experiential learning aspect of the BI&A curriculum.

Papers in this Special Issue

The  idea  for  this  special  issue  began  in  May  2009,  when
Detmar Straub, the Editor-in-Chief of MIS Quarterly, soli-
cited suggestions for special issues from the editorial board
members.  We submitted the special issue proposal on Busi-
ness Intelligence Research in August 2009, with the call-for-
papers approved and distributed at the 30th Annual Interna-
tional Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in Decem-
ber of that year.  Submissions to this special issue needed to
relate  to  MIS  Quarterly’s  mission  with  strong  managerial,
organizational, and societal relevance and impact. In addition
to the Design Science approach (Hevner et al. 2004; March &
Storey 2008), rigorous and relevant BI-related research using
management science (modeling, optimization), information
economics, and organizational and behavioral methodologies
(case studies, surveys) was also welcomed.  A total of 62
manuscripts was received by October 2010.  In the following
20 months, six of the manuscripts went through three or four
review rounds and were then accepted for this issue.  

The six papers address various aspects of the BI&A research
framework presented in this introduction paper (see Table 7).
All six papers are based on BI&A 1.0, with three also based
on BI&A 2.0.  The first three papers by Chau and Xu, Park et
al., and Lau et al. focus on BI&A 2.0 with applications on e-
commerce and market intelligence using text, web, and net-
work analytics.  In the next two papers, both Hu et al. and
Abbasi et al. work in the category of BI&A 1.0 with a focus
on  security,  but  Hu  et  al.  use  network  analytics  whereas
Abbasi et al. emphasize security analysis and data analytics. 
Finally, Sahoo et al. also work in BI&A 1.0, with direct appli-
cation to e-commerce and market intelligence using web and
data analytics.

In “Business Intelligence in Blogs:  Understanding Consumer
Interactions and Communities,” Michael Chau and Jennifer
Xu recognized the potential “gold mine” of blog content for
business  intelligence  and  developed  a  framework  for
gathering business intelligence by automatically collecting
and  analyzing  blog  content  and  bloggers’  interaction  net-
works.    A  system  developed  using  this  framework  was
applied to two case studies, which revealed novel patterns in
blogger interactions and communities.

Sung-Hyuk Park, Soon-Young Huh, Wonseok Oh, and Sang
Pil Han in their paper, “A Social Network-Based Inference
Model for Validating Customer Profile Data,” argue that busi-
ness intelligence systems are of limited value when they deal
with inaccurate and unreliable data.  The authors proposed a
social network-driven inference framework to determine the
accuracy  and  reliability  of  self-reported  customer  profiles.
The  framework  utilized  the  individuals’  social  circles  and

1184

communication patterns within their circles.  To construct the
specific  inference  and  validation  model,  a  combination  of
methods  was  used,  including  query  processing,  statistical
inference, social network analysis, and user profiling.  The
authors analyzed over 20 million actual mobile call trans-
actions  and  their  proposed  social  network-based  inference
model consistently outperformed the alternative approaches.

In “Web 2.0 Environmental Scanning and Adaptive Decision
Support for Business Mergers and Acquisitions,” Raymond
Lau, Stephen Liao, K. F. Wong, and Dickson Chiu analyzed
company mergers and acquisitions (M&A).  Online environ-
mental scanning with Web 2.0 provides top executives with
opportunities to tap into collective web intelligence to develop
better insights about the socio-cultural and political-economic
factors that cross-border M&As face.  Grounded on Porter’s
five  forces  model,  this  research  designed  a  due  diligence
scorecard model that leverages collective web intelligence to
enhance M&A decision making.  The authors also developed
an adaptive business intelligence (BI) 2.0 system, which they
applied to Chinese companies’ cross-border M&A activities.

In their paper, “Network-Based Modeling and Analysis of
Systemic  Risk  in  Banking  Systems,”  Daning  Hu,  J.  Leon
Zhao, Zhimin Hua, and Michael Wong analyzed systemic risk
in banking systems by treating banks as a network linked with
financial relationships, leading to a network approach to risk
management (NARM).  The authors used NARM to analyze
systemic risk attributed to each individual bank via simulation
based on real-world data from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  NARM  offered  a  new  means  by  which  con-
tagious bank failures could be predicted and capital injection
priorities at the individual bank level could be determined in
the wake of a financial crisis.  A simulation study showed
that, under significant market shocks, the interbank payment
links  became  more  influential  than  the  correlated  bank
portfolio links in determining an individual bank’s survival.

Ahmed Abbasi, Conan Albrecht, Anthony Vance, and James
Hansen in their paper, “MetaFraud:  A Meta-Learning Frame-
work  for  Detecting  Financial  Fraud,”  employed  a  design
science  approach  to  develop  MetaFraud,  a  meta-learning
framework for enhanced financial fraud detection.  A series
of experiments was conducted on thousands of legitimate and
fraudulent firms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the frame-
work over existing benchmark methods.  The research results
have  implications  for  compliance  officers,  investors,  audit
firms, and regulators.

The paper by Nachiketa Sahoo, Param Vir Singh, and Tridas
Mukhopadhyay, “A Hidden Markov Model for Collaborative
Filtering,”  reports  on  the  analysis  of  making  personalized
recommendations when user preferences are changing.  The

Summary and Conclusions

Through BI&A 1.0 initiatives, businesses and organizations
from  all  sectors  began  to  gain  critical  insights  from  the
structured data collected through various enterprise systems
and analyzed by commercial relational database management
systems.  Over the past several years, web intelligence, web
analytics, web 2.0, and the ability to mine unstructured user-
generated contents have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research, leading to unprecedented intelligence on
consumer  opinion,  customer  needs,  and  recognizing  new
business opportunities.  Now, in this era of Big Data, even

while BI&A 2.0 is still maturing, we find ourselves poised at
the brink of BI&A 3.0, with all the attendant uncertainty that
new and potentially revolutionary technologies bring.

This MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence
Research  is  intended  to  serve,  in  part,  as  a  platform  and
conversation guide for examining how the IS discipline can
better serve the needs of business decision makers in light of
maturing and emerging BI&A technologies, ubiquitous Big
Data, and the predicted shortages of data-savvy managers and
of business professionals with deep analytical skills.  How
can academic IS programs continue to meet the needs of their
traditional  students,  while  also  reaching  the  working  IT
professional in need of new analytical skills?  A new vision
for IS may be needed to address this and other questions.

By  highlighting  several  applications  such  as  e-commerce,
market intelligence, e-government, healthcare, and security,
and  by  mapping  important  facets  of  the  current  BI&A
knowledge landscape, we hope to contribute to future sources
of  knowledge  and  to  augment  current  discussions  on  the
importance of (relevant) academic research.

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A
research and education are identified.  We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications.
Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the
proposed BI&A research framework.

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few

in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with
several others from the related fields of marketing, manage-
ment,  communication,  and  mathematics.    Many  of  these
authors are close collaborators, for example, Hsinchun Chen
(#1),  Jay  F.  Nunamaker  (#18),  Michael  Chau  (#11),  and
Wingyan  Chung  (#18)  through  the  University  of  Arizona
connection,11  and  Barabara  H.  Wixom  (#5)  and  Hugh  J.
Watson (#5) through the University of Georgia connection.
We also report the PageRank score (Brin and Page 1998), a
popular metric for data and network analytics, for the BI&A
authors  based  on  the  coauthorship  network  within  BI&A
publications.  A higher PageRank score captures an author’s
propensity to collaborate with other prolific authors.  The

analysis  reveals broad and even contribution of authors from
North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, reflecting the
diversity and international interest in the field of BI&A.

The  last  set  of  analyses  investigated  the  content  of  BI&A
publications from 2000–2011.  Mallet (McCallum 2002), a
Java-based open-source NLP text analytics tool, was used to
extract the top bigrams (two-word phrases) for each year.  A
few bi-grams were combined to form more meaningful BI-

related trigrams such as “customer relation management” and
“enterprise resource planning.”  These keywords were then
ranked based on their frequency, and the top 30 keywords
displayed using the tagcloud visualization.  More important
keywords  are  highlighted  with  larger  fonts  as  shown  in
Figure 3.  For example, competitive advantage, big data, data
warehousing, and decision support emerged as the top four
topics in the BI&A literature.  Other BI&A related topics such
as customer relation management, data mining, competitive

intelligence,  enterprise  resource  planning,  and  knowledge
management were also highly ranked.  Overall, the topics
extracted were highly relevant to BI&A, especially for its
managerial  and  application  values,  although  most  of  the
detailed technical terms, as described in the previous research
framework sections, were not present.  This could be attri-
buted to the tendency of authors to use broad terminologies in
article titles and abstracts.

BI&A Education and Program
Development

BI&A provides opportunities not only for the research com-
munity, but also for education and program development.  In
July  2012,  Columbia  University  and  New  York  City
announced plans to invest over $80 million dollars in a new
Center  for  Data  Science,  which  is  expected  to  generate
thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenues from
100 startup companies over the next 10 years  (Associated
Press 2012).  BI&A is data science in business.  Job postings
seeking  data  scientists  and  business  analytics  specialists
abound these days.  There is a clear shortage of professionals
with the “deep” knowledge required to manage the three V’s
of big data:  volume, velocity, and variety (Russom 2011).
There is also an increasing demand for individuals with the
deep knowledge needed to manage the three “perspectives” of
business decision making:  descriptive, predictive, and pre-
scriptive analytics.  In this section, we describe BI&A educa-
tion  in  business  schools,  present  the  challenges  facing  IS
departments, and discuss BI&A program development oppor-
tunities.  We also provide some suggestions for the IS disci-
pline in addressing these challenges (Chiang et al. 2012).

Education Challenges

BI&A focuses on understanding, interpretation, strategizing,
and taking action to further organizational interests.  Several
academic disciplines have contributed to BI&A, including IS,
CS, Statistics, Management, and Marketing, as shown in our
bibliometric study.  IS programs, in particular, are uniquely
positioned to train a new generation of scholars and students
due to their emphasis on key data management and infor-
mation technologies, business-oriented statistical analysis and
management science techniques, and broad business disci-
pline exposure (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Marketing, and
Economics).

Since  its  inception  approximately  45  years  ago,  IS  as  an
academic discipline has primarily focused on business needs
in an era when the major challenges involved the management
of internal business and transaction data.  In the age of big
data, these problems remain, but the emphasis in industry has
shifted to data analysis and rapid business decision making
based on huge volumes of information.  Such time-critical
decision making largely takes place outside of the IS function
(i.e.,  in  business  units  such  as  marketing,  finance,  and
logistics).  Can IS programs serve the needs of these business
decision makers?  Can we provide courses in data mining,
text mining, opinion mining, social media/network analytics,
web  mining,  and  predictive  analytics  that  are  required  for
marketing and finance majors?  We should also ask ourselves
about the skill sets needed by students.  Should we recruit
students with strong math and statistical skills, for example?
We contend that a new vision for IS, or at least for some IS
programs, should address these questions.

BI&A presents a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools to position themselves as a viable option  for edu-

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

cating professionals with the necessary depth and academic
rigor to tackle the increased complexity of BI&A issues.  IS
programs housed within business schools have access to a
variety of business courses, as well as courses intended to
improve communication and presentation skills.  It is also
common for business schools to house management science
and statistics faculty in the same IS unit.

BI&A Knowledge and Skills

BI&A education should be interdisciplinary and cover critical
analytical and IT skills, business and domain knowledge, and
communication  skills  required  in  a  complex  data-centric
business environment.

Analytical and IT skills include a variety of evolving topics. 
They  are  drawn  from  disciplines  such  as  statistics  and
computer science for managing and analyzing both structured
data and unstructured text.  Coverage of these topics ranges
from  BI&A  1.0  to  BI&A  3.0.    The  academic  programs
intended  to  produce  BI&A  professionals  should  consider
these analytical and IT skills as suggested in Table 3 of our
research framework.

To provide useful insights and decision-making support, the
BI&A professionals must be capable of understanding the
business issues and framing the appropriate analytical solu-
tions.  The necessary business knowledge for BI&A profes-
sionals  ranges  from  general  familiarity  with  the  areas  of
Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Logistics, and
Operation Management, to the domain knowledge required in
specific  BI&A  applications,  some  of  which  are  discussed
earlier and summarized in Table 2.

The importance of an organization-wide culture for informed
fact-based decision making for business analytics is empha-
sized by Davenport (2006).  To support such a culture, BI&A
professionals need to know not only how to turn raw data and
information (through analytics) into meaningful and action-
able knowledge for an organization, but also how to properly
interact with and communicate this knowledge to the business
and domain experts of the organization.

Program Development

BI&A provides a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools  to  develop  new  courses,  certificate  programs,  and
degree programs charged with preparing the next generation
of analytical thinkers.  There are many options for delivering
BI&A  education.    Because  of  the  depth  of  knowledge
required, graduate programs are the obvious choice.  Viable

The  first  option  requires  the  effort  of  developing  a  new
program.  A few universities have embarked on this endeavor.
A nonexhaustive list includes North Carolina State Univer-
sity, Saint Joseph’s University, Northwestern University, the
University of Denver, Stevens Institute of Technology, and
Fordham University.  New York University will launch its
new program in May 2013.  New MS degree programs can be
designed explicitly to attract analytically strong students with
undergraduate degrees in areas such as mathematics, science,
and  computer  science,  and  to  prepare  these  students  for
careers, not only in the IS or IT groups in industry, but also in
functional areas such as research and development, marketing,
media, logistics, and finance.

The second option leverages existing MS IS programs with a
BI&A  concentration  that  would  supplement  the  already
existing curriculum in IT, data management, and business and
communication courses with additional analytics coverage. 
This  option  has  been  adopted  by  a  number  of  schools
including the IS departments at Carnegie Mellon University
and the University of Arizona.  This option provides BI&A
knowledge  and  skills  for  students  who  will  primarily  find
careers in IS groups in industry.

For working IT professionals who wish to expand into BI&A,
a part-time MS or certificate program (the third option) offer
practical and valid alternatives.  These certificate programs
can be delivered online or on-site and need to provide the
skills that will complement the current IT or business experi-
ence of IT professionals, and/or provide technical and analy-
tical skills to business professionals in non-IT areas.  Online
programs that are currently available include Northwestern
University’s MS in Predictive Analytics and Stanford Univer-
sity’s Graduate Certificate on Mining Big Data.  In addition,
IS programs can help design a BI&A concentration in MBA
programs  to  help  train  a  new  generation  of  data-  and
analytics-savvy managers.

A  key  to  success  for  a  BI&A  program  is  to  integrate  the
concept of “learning by doing” in the BI&A curriculum via
hands-on projects, internships, and industry-guided practicum. 
Big  data  analytics  requires  trial-and-error  and  experimen-
tation.  Strong relationships and partnerships between aca-
demic programs and industry partners are critical to foster the
experiential learning aspect of the BI&A curriculum.

Papers in this Special Issue

The  idea  for  this  special  issue  began  in  May  2009,  when
Detmar Straub, the Editor-in-Chief of MIS Quarterly, soli-
cited suggestions for special issues from the editorial board
members.  We submitted the special issue proposal on Busi-
ness Intelligence Research in August 2009, with the call-for-
papers approved and distributed at the 30th Annual Interna-
tional Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in Decem-
ber of that year.  Submissions to this special issue needed to
relate  to  MIS  Quarterly’s  mission  with  strong  managerial,
organizational, and societal relevance and impact. In addition
to the Design Science approach (Hevner et al. 2004; March &
Storey 2008), rigorous and relevant BI-related research using
management science (modeling, optimization), information
economics, and organizational and behavioral methodologies
(case studies, surveys) was also welcomed.  A total of 62
manuscripts was received by October 2010.  In the following
20 months, six of the manuscripts went through three or four
review rounds and were then accepted for this issue.  

The six papers address various aspects of the BI&A research
framework presented in this introduction paper (see Table 7).
All six papers are based on BI&A 1.0, with three also based
on BI&A 2.0.  The first three papers by Chau and Xu, Park et
al., and Lau et al. focus on BI&A 2.0 with applications on e-
commerce and market intelligence using text, web, and net-
work analytics.  In the next two papers, both Hu et al. and
Abbasi et al. work in the category of BI&A 1.0 with a focus
on  security,  but  Hu  et  al.  use  network  analytics  whereas
Abbasi et al. emphasize security analysis and data analytics. 
Finally, Sahoo et al. also work in BI&A 1.0, with direct appli-
cation to e-commerce and market intelligence using web and
data analytics.

In “Business Intelligence in Blogs:  Understanding Consumer
Interactions and Communities,” Michael Chau and Jennifer
Xu recognized the potential “gold mine” of blog content for
business  intelligence  and  developed  a  framework  for
gathering business intelligence by automatically collecting
and  analyzing  blog  content  and  bloggers’  interaction  net-
works.    A  system  developed  using  this  framework  was
applied to two case studies, which revealed novel patterns in
blogger interactions and communities.

Sung-Hyuk Park, Soon-Young Huh, Wonseok Oh, and Sang
Pil Han in their paper, “A Social Network-Based Inference
Model for Validating Customer Profile Data,” argue that busi-
ness intelligence systems are of limited value when they deal
with inaccurate and unreliable data.  The authors proposed a
social network-driven inference framework to determine the
accuracy  and  reliability  of  self-reported  customer  profiles.
The  framework  utilized  the  individuals’  social  circles  and

1184

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

communication patterns within their circles.  To construct the
specific  inference  and  validation  model,  a  combination  of
methods  was  used,  including  query  processing,  statistical
inference, social network analysis, and user profiling.  The
authors analyzed over 20 million actual mobile call trans-
actions  and  their  proposed  social  network-based  inference
model consistently outperformed the alternative approaches.

In “Web 2.0 Environmental Scanning and Adaptive Decision
Support for Business Mergers and Acquisitions,” Raymond
Lau, Stephen Liao, K. F. Wong, and Dickson Chiu analyzed
company mergers and acquisitions (M&A).  Online environ-
mental scanning with Web 2.0 provides top executives with
opportunities to tap into collective web intelligence to develop
better insights about the socio-cultural and political-economic
factors that cross-border M&As face.  Grounded on Porter’s
five  forces  model,  this  research  designed  a  due  diligence
scorecard model that leverages collective web intelligence to
enhance M&A decision making.  The authors also developed
an adaptive business intelligence (BI) 2.0 system, which they
applied to Chinese companies’ cross-border M&A activities.

In their paper, “Network-Based Modeling and Analysis of
Systemic  Risk  in  Banking  Systems,”  Daning  Hu,  J.  Leon
Zhao, Zhimin Hua, and Michael Wong analyzed systemic risk
in banking systems by treating banks as a network linked with
financial relationships, leading to a network approach to risk
management (NARM).  The authors used NARM to analyze
systemic risk attributed to each individual bank via simulation
based on real-world data from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  NARM  offered  a  new  means  by  which  con-
tagious bank failures could be predicted and capital injection
priorities at the individual bank level could be determined in
the wake of a financial crisis.  A simulation study showed
that, under significant market shocks, the interbank payment
links  became  more  influential  than  the  correlated  bank
portfolio links in determining an individual bank’s survival.

Ahmed Abbasi, Conan Albrecht, Anthony Vance, and James
Hansen in their paper, “MetaFraud:  A Meta-Learning Frame-
work  for  Detecting  Financial  Fraud,”  employed  a  design
science  approach  to  develop  MetaFraud,  a  meta-learning
framework for enhanced financial fraud detection.  A series
of experiments was conducted on thousands of legitimate and
fraudulent firms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the frame-
work over existing benchmark methods.  The research results
have  implications  for  compliance  officers,  investors,  audit
firms, and regulators.

The paper by Nachiketa Sahoo, Param Vir Singh, and Tridas
Mukhopadhyay, “A Hidden Markov Model for Collaborative
Filtering,”  reports  on  the  analysis  of  making  personalized
recommendations when user preferences are changing.  The

Summary and Conclusions

Through BI&A 1.0 initiatives, businesses and organizations
from  all  sectors  began  to  gain  critical  insights  from  the
structured data collected through various enterprise systems
and analyzed by commercial relational database management
systems.  Over the past several years, web intelligence, web
analytics, web 2.0, and the ability to mine unstructured user-
generated contents have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research, leading to unprecedented intelligence on
consumer  opinion,  customer  needs,  and  recognizing  new
business opportunities.  Now, in this era of Big Data, even

while BI&A 2.0 is still maturing, we find ourselves poised at
the brink of BI&A 3.0, with all the attendant uncertainty that
new and potentially revolutionary technologies bring.

This MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence
Research  is  intended  to  serve,  in  part,  as  a  platform  and
conversation guide for examining how the IS discipline can
better serve the needs of business decision makers in light of
maturing and emerging BI&A technologies, ubiquitous Big
Data, and the predicted shortages of data-savvy managers and
of business professionals with deep analytical skills.  How
can academic IS programs continue to meet the needs of their
traditional  students,  while  also  reaching  the  working  IT
professional in need of new analytical skills?  A new vision
for IS may be needed to address this and other questions.

By  highlighting  several  applications  such  as  e-commerce,
market intelligence, e-government, healthcare, and security,
and  by  mapping  important  facets  of  the  current  BI&A
knowledge landscape, we hope to contribute to future sources
of  knowledge  and  to  augment  current  discussions  on  the
importance of (relevant) academic research.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Finally, the six papers chosen for this special issue are them-
selves a microcosm of the current state of BI&A research. 
These “best of the best” research papers showcase how high-
quality academic research can address real-world problems
and contribute solutions that are relevant and long lasting—
exactly the challenge that our discipline continues to face.

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A
research and education are identified.  We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications.
Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the
proposed BI&A research framework.

Keywords:  Business intelligence and  analytics, big data analytics, Web 2.0

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

work.  Journals are somewhat more limited in their publi-
cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few
business school journals also contain related BI&A research
in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with
several others from the related fields of marketing, manage-
ment,  communication,  and  mathematics.    Many  of  these
authors are close collaborators, for example, Hsinchun Chen
(#1),  Jay  F.  Nunamaker  (#18),  Michael  Chau  (#11),  and
Wingyan  Chung  (#18)  through  the  University  of  Arizona
connection,11  and  Barabara  H.  Wixom  (#5)  and  Hugh  J.
Watson (#5) through the University of Georgia connection.
We also report the PageRank score (Brin and Page 1998), a
popular metric for data and network analytics, for the BI&A
authors  based  on  the  coauthorship  network  within  BI&A
publications.  A higher PageRank score captures an author’s
propensity to collaborate with other prolific authors.  The

analysis  reveals broad and even contribution of authors from
North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, reflecting the
diversity and international interest in the field of BI&A.

The  last  set  of  analyses  investigated  the  content  of  BI&A
publications from 2000–2011.  Mallet (McCallum 2002), a
Java-based open-source NLP text analytics tool, was used to
extract the top bigrams (two-word phrases) for each year.  A
few bi-grams were combined to form more meaningful BI-

related trigrams such as “customer relation management” and
“enterprise resource planning.”  These keywords were then
ranked based on their frequency, and the top 30 keywords
displayed using the tagcloud visualization.  More important
keywords  are  highlighted  with  larger  fonts  as  shown  in
Figure 3.  For example, competitive advantage, big data, data
warehousing, and decision support emerged as the top four
topics in the BI&A literature.  Other BI&A related topics such
as customer relation management, data mining, competitive

intelligence,  enterprise  resource  planning,  and  knowledge
management were also highly ranked.  Overall, the topics
extracted were highly relevant to BI&A, especially for its
managerial  and  application  values,  although  most  of  the
detailed technical terms, as described in the previous research
framework sections, were not present.  This could be attri-
buted to the tendency of authors to use broad terminologies in
article titles and abstracts.

BI&A Education and Program
Development

BI&A provides opportunities not only for the research com-
munity, but also for education and program development.  In
July  2012,  Columbia  University  and  New  York  City
announced plans to invest over $80 million dollars in a new
Center  for  Data  Science,  which  is  expected  to  generate
thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenues from
100 startup companies over the next 10 years  (Associated
Press 2012).  BI&A is data science in business.  Job postings
seeking  data  scientists  and  business  analytics  specialists
abound these days.  There is a clear shortage of professionals
with the “deep” knowledge required to manage the three V’s
of big data:  volume, velocity, and variety (Russom 2011).
There is also an increasing demand for individuals with the
deep knowledge needed to manage the three “perspectives” of
business decision making:  descriptive, predictive, and pre-
scriptive analytics.  In this section, we describe BI&A educa-
tion  in  business  schools,  present  the  challenges  facing  IS
departments, and discuss BI&A program development oppor-
tunities.  We also provide some suggestions for the IS disci-
pline in addressing these challenges (Chiang et al. 2012).

Education Challenges

BI&A focuses on understanding, interpretation, strategizing,
and taking action to further organizational interests.  Several
academic disciplines have contributed to BI&A, including IS,
CS, Statistics, Management, and Marketing, as shown in our
bibliometric study.  IS programs, in particular, are uniquely
positioned to train a new generation of scholars and students
due to their emphasis on key data management and infor-
mation technologies, business-oriented statistical analysis and
management science techniques, and broad business disci-
pline exposure (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Marketing, and
Economics).

Since  its  inception  approximately  45  years  ago,  IS  as  an
academic discipline has primarily focused on business needs
in an era when the major challenges involved the management
of internal business and transaction data.  In the age of big
data, these problems remain, but the emphasis in industry has
shifted to data analysis and rapid business decision making
based on huge volumes of information.  Such time-critical
decision making largely takes place outside of the IS function
(i.e.,  in  business  units  such  as  marketing,  finance,  and
logistics).  Can IS programs serve the needs of these business
decision makers?  Can we provide courses in data mining,
text mining, opinion mining, social media/network analytics,
web  mining,  and  predictive  analytics  that  are  required  for
marketing and finance majors?  We should also ask ourselves
about the skill sets needed by students.  Should we recruit
students with strong math and statistical skills, for example?
We contend that a new vision for IS, or at least for some IS
programs, should address these questions.

BI&A presents a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools to position themselves as a viable option  for edu-

cating professionals with the necessary depth and academic
rigor to tackle the increased complexity of BI&A issues.  IS
programs housed within business schools have access to a
variety of business courses, as well as courses intended to
improve communication and presentation skills.  It is also
common for business schools to house management science
and statistics faculty in the same IS unit.

program development options in delivering BI&A education

BI&A Knowledge and Skills

BI&A education should be interdisciplinary and cover critical
analytical and IT skills, business and domain knowledge, and
communication  skills  required  in  a  complex  data-centric
business environment.

Analytical and IT skills include a variety of evolving topics. 
They  are  drawn  from  disciplines  such  as  statistics  and
computer science for managing and analyzing both structured
data and unstructured text.  Coverage of these topics ranges
from  BI&A  1.0  to  BI&A  3.0.    The  academic  programs
intended  to  produce  BI&A  professionals  should  consider
these analytical and IT skills as suggested in Table 3 of our
research framework.

To provide useful insights and decision-making support, the
BI&A professionals must be capable of understanding the
business issues and framing the appropriate analytical solu-
tions.  The necessary business knowledge for BI&A profes-
sionals  ranges  from  general  familiarity  with  the  areas  of
Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Logistics, and
Operation Management, to the domain knowledge required in
specific  BI&A  applications,  some  of  which  are  discussed
earlier and summarized in Table 2.

The importance of an organization-wide culture for informed
fact-based decision making for business analytics is empha-
sized by Davenport (2006).  To support such a culture, BI&A
professionals need to know not only how to turn raw data and
information (through analytics) into meaningful and action-
able knowledge for an organization, but also how to properly
interact with and communicate this knowledge to the business
and domain experts of the organization.

Program Development

BI&A provides a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools  to  develop  new  courses,  certificate  programs,  and
degree programs charged with preparing the next generation
of analytical thinkers.  There are many options for delivering
BI&A  education.    Because  of  the  depth  of  knowledge
required, graduate programs are the obvious choice.  Viable

The  first  option  requires  the  effort  of  developing  a  new
program.  A few universities have embarked on this endeavor.
A nonexhaustive list includes North Carolina State Univer-
sity, Saint Joseph’s University, Northwestern University, the
University of Denver, Stevens Institute of Technology, and
Fordham University.  New York University will launch its
new program in May 2013.  New MS degree programs can be
designed explicitly to attract analytically strong students with
undergraduate degrees in areas such as mathematics, science,
and  computer  science,  and  to  prepare  these  students  for
careers, not only in the IS or IT groups in industry, but also in
functional areas such as research and development, marketing,
media, logistics, and finance.

The second option leverages existing MS IS programs with a
BI&A  concentration  that  would  supplement  the  already
existing curriculum in IT, data management, and business and
communication courses with additional analytics coverage. 
This  option  has  been  adopted  by  a  number  of  schools
including the IS departments at Carnegie Mellon University
and the University of Arizona.  This option provides BI&A
knowledge  and  skills  for  students  who  will  primarily  find
careers in IS groups in industry.

For working IT professionals who wish to expand into BI&A,
a part-time MS or certificate program (the third option) offer
practical and valid alternatives.  These certificate programs
can be delivered online or on-site and need to provide the
skills that will complement the current IT or business experi-
ence of IT professionals, and/or provide technical and analy-
tical skills to business professionals in non-IT areas.  Online
programs that are currently available include Northwestern
University’s MS in Predictive Analytics and Stanford Univer-
sity’s Graduate Certificate on Mining Big Data.  In addition,
IS programs can help design a BI&A concentration in MBA
programs  to  help  train  a  new  generation  of  data-  and
analytics-savvy managers.

A  key  to  success  for  a  BI&A  program  is  to  integrate  the
concept of “learning by doing” in the BI&A curriculum via
hands-on projects, internships, and industry-guided practicum. 
Big  data  analytics  requires  trial-and-error  and  experimen-
tation.  Strong relationships and partnerships between aca-
demic programs and industry partners are critical to foster the
experiential learning aspect of the BI&A curriculum.

Papers in this Special Issue

The  idea  for  this  special  issue  began  in  May  2009,  when
Detmar Straub, the Editor-in-Chief of MIS Quarterly, soli-
cited suggestions for special issues from the editorial board
members.  We submitted the special issue proposal on Busi-
ness Intelligence Research in August 2009, with the call-for-
papers approved and distributed at the 30th Annual Interna-
tional Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in Decem-
ber of that year.  Submissions to this special issue needed to
relate  to  MIS  Quarterly’s  mission  with  strong  managerial,
organizational, and societal relevance and impact. In addition
to the Design Science approach (Hevner et al. 2004; March &
Storey 2008), rigorous and relevant BI-related research using
management science (modeling, optimization), information
economics, and organizational and behavioral methodologies
(case studies, surveys) was also welcomed.  A total of 62
manuscripts was received by October 2010.  In the following
20 months, six of the manuscripts went through three or four
review rounds and were then accepted for this issue.  

The six papers address various aspects of the BI&A research
framework presented in this introduction paper (see Table 7).
All six papers are based on BI&A 1.0, with three also based
on BI&A 2.0.  The first three papers by Chau and Xu, Park et
al., and Lau et al. focus on BI&A 2.0 with applications on e-
commerce and market intelligence using text, web, and net-
work analytics.  In the next two papers, both Hu et al. and
Abbasi et al. work in the category of BI&A 1.0 with a focus
on  security,  but  Hu  et  al.  use  network  analytics  whereas
Abbasi et al. emphasize security analysis and data analytics. 
Finally, Sahoo et al. also work in BI&A 1.0, with direct appli-
cation to e-commerce and market intelligence using web and
data analytics.

In “Business Intelligence in Blogs:  Understanding Consumer
Interactions and Communities,” Michael Chau and Jennifer
Xu recognized the potential “gold mine” of blog content for
business  intelligence  and  developed  a  framework  for
gathering business intelligence by automatically collecting
and  analyzing  blog  content  and  bloggers’  interaction  net-
works.    A  system  developed  using  this  framework  was
applied to two case studies, which revealed novel patterns in
blogger interactions and communities.

Sung-Hyuk Park, Soon-Young Huh, Wonseok Oh, and Sang
Pil Han in their paper, “A Social Network-Based Inference
Model for Validating Customer Profile Data,” argue that busi-
ness intelligence systems are of limited value when they deal
with inaccurate and unreliable data.  The authors proposed a
social network-driven inference framework to determine the
accuracy  and  reliability  of  self-reported  customer  profiles.
The  framework  utilized  the  individuals’  social  circles  and

1184

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

communication patterns within their circles.  To construct the
specific  inference  and  validation  model,  a  combination  of
methods  was  used,  including  query  processing,  statistical
inference, social network analysis, and user profiling.  The
authors analyzed over 20 million actual mobile call trans-
actions  and  their  proposed  social  network-based  inference
model consistently outperformed the alternative approaches.

In “Web 2.0 Environmental Scanning and Adaptive Decision
Support for Business Mergers and Acquisitions,” Raymond
Lau, Stephen Liao, K. F. Wong, and Dickson Chiu analyzed
company mergers and acquisitions (M&A).  Online environ-
mental scanning with Web 2.0 provides top executives with
opportunities to tap into collective web intelligence to develop
better insights about the socio-cultural and political-economic
factors that cross-border M&As face.  Grounded on Porter’s
five  forces  model,  this  research  designed  a  due  diligence
scorecard model that leverages collective web intelligence to
enhance M&A decision making.  The authors also developed
an adaptive business intelligence (BI) 2.0 system, which they
applied to Chinese companies’ cross-border M&A activities.

In their paper, “Network-Based Modeling and Analysis of
Systemic  Risk  in  Banking  Systems,”  Daning  Hu,  J.  Leon
Zhao, Zhimin Hua, and Michael Wong analyzed systemic risk
in banking systems by treating banks as a network linked with
financial relationships, leading to a network approach to risk
management (NARM).  The authors used NARM to analyze
systemic risk attributed to each individual bank via simulation
based on real-world data from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  NARM  offered  a  new  means  by  which  con-
tagious bank failures could be predicted and capital injection
priorities at the individual bank level could be determined in
the wake of a financial crisis.  A simulation study showed
that, under significant market shocks, the interbank payment
links  became  more  influential  than  the  correlated  bank
portfolio links in determining an individual bank’s survival.

Ahmed Abbasi, Conan Albrecht, Anthony Vance, and James
Hansen in their paper, “MetaFraud:  A Meta-Learning Frame-
work  for  Detecting  Financial  Fraud,”  employed  a  design
science  approach  to  develop  MetaFraud,  a  meta-learning
framework for enhanced financial fraud detection.  A series
of experiments was conducted on thousands of legitimate and
fraudulent firms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the frame-
work over existing benchmark methods.  The research results
have  implications  for  compliance  officers,  investors,  audit
firms, and regulators.

The paper by Nachiketa Sahoo, Param Vir Singh, and Tridas
Mukhopadhyay, “A Hidden Markov Model for Collaborative
Filtering,”  reports  on  the  analysis  of  making  personalized
recommendations when user preferences are changing.  The

Summary and Conclusions

Through BI&A 1.0 initiatives, businesses and organizations
from  all  sectors  began  to  gain  critical  insights  from  the
structured data collected through various enterprise systems
and analyzed by commercial relational database management
systems.  Over the past several years, web intelligence, web
analytics, web 2.0, and the ability to mine unstructured user-
generated contents have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research, leading to unprecedented intelligence on
consumer  opinion,  customer  needs,  and  recognizing  new
business opportunities.  Now, in this era of Big Data, even

while BI&A 2.0 is still maturing, we find ourselves poised at
the brink of BI&A 3.0, with all the attendant uncertainty that
new and potentially revolutionary technologies bring.

This MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence
Research  is  intended  to  serve,  in  part,  as  a  platform  and
conversation guide for examining how the IS discipline can
better serve the needs of business decision makers in light of
maturing and emerging BI&A technologies, ubiquitous Big
Data, and the predicted shortages of data-savvy managers and
of business professionals with deep analytical skills.  How
can academic IS programs continue to meet the needs of their
traditional  students,  while  also  reaching  the  working  IT
professional in need of new analytical skills?  A new vision
for IS may be needed to address this and other questions.

By  highlighting  several  applications  such  as  e-commerce,
market intelligence, e-government, healthcare, and security,
and  by  mapping  important  facets  of  the  current  BI&A
knowledge landscape, we hope to contribute to future sources
of  knowledge  and  to  augment  current  discussions  on  the
importance of (relevant) academic research.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Finally, the six papers chosen for this special issue are them-
selves a microcosm of the current state of BI&A research. 
These “best of the best” research papers showcase how high-
quality academic research can address real-world problems
and contribute solutions that are relevant and long lasting—
exactly the challenge that our discipline continues to face.

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) has emerged as an important area of study for both practitioners
and researchers, reflecting the magnitude and impact of data-related problems to be solved in contemporary
business organizations.  This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence Research
first provides a framework that identifies the evolution, applications, and emerging research areas of BI&A. 
BI&A 1.0, BI&A 2.0, and BI&A 3.0 are  defined  and described in terms of their key characteristics and
capabilities.  Current research in BI&A is analyzed and challenges and opportunities associated with BI&A
research and education are identified.  We also report a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade of related academic and industry publications.
Finally, the six articles that comprise this special issue are introduced and characterized in terms of the
proposed BI&A research framework.

Introduction

Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past  two  decades.    Industry  studies  have  highlighted  this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries  and  25  industries,  the  IBM  Tech  Trends  Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97

percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) pre-
dicted that by 2018, the United States alone will face a short-
age of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.

Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus profes-
sor at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap?  Data.  And
what is complementary to data?  Analysis.  So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data:  databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in dif-
ferent organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, tech-
nologies, systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions.  In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical  technologies,  BI&A  includes  business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelli-
gence, e-government, healthcare, and security.

This  introduction  to  the  MIS  Quarterly  Special  Issue  on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many chal-
lenges and opportunities.  Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities.  We then report
on  a  bibliometric  study  of  critical  BI&A  publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications.  Educa-
tion  and  program  development  opportunities  in  BI&A  are
presented,  followed  by  a  summary  of  the  six  articles  that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.

BI&A Evolution:  Key Characteristics
and Capabilities

The  term  intelligence  has  been  used  by  researchers  in
artificial intelligence since the 1950s.  Business intelligence
became a popular term in the business and IT communities
only in the 1990s.  In the late 2000s, business analytics was
introduced to represent the key analytical component in BI
(Davenport  2006).    More  recently  big  data  and  big  data
analytics have been used to describe the data sets and ana-
lytical  techniques  in  applications  that  are  so  large  (from
terabytes  to  exabytes) and complex (from sensor to social
media  data)  that  they  require  advanced  and  unique  data

storage,  management,  analysis,  and  visualization  technol-
ogies.  In this article we use business intelligence and ana-
lytics (BI&A) as a unified term and treat big data analytics as
a related field that offers new directions for BI&A research.

BI&A 1.0

As a data-centric approach, BI&A has its roots in the long-
standing  database  management  field.    It  relies  heavily  on
various data collection, extraction, and analysis technologies
(Chaudhuri  et  al.  2011;  Turban  et  al.  2008;  Watson  and
Wixom  2007).    The  BI&A  technologies  and  applications
currently adopted in industry can be considered as BI&A 1.0,
where  data  are  mostly  structured,  collected  by  companies
through various legacy systems, and often stored in commer-
cial relational database management systems (RDBMS).  The
analytical  techniques  commonly  used  in  these  systems,
popularized in the 1990s, are grounded mainly in statistical
methods developed in the 1970s and data mining techniques
developed in the 1980s.  

Data management and warehousing is considered the foun-
dation  of  BI&A  1.0.    Design  of  data  marts  and  tools  for
extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) are essential for
converting and integrating enterprise-specific data.  Database
query, online analytical processing (OLAP), and reporting
tools  based  on  intuitive,  but  simple,  graphics  are  used  to
explore important data characteristics.  Business performance
management (BPM) using scorecards and dashboards help
analyze and visualize a variety of performance metrics.  In
addition  to  these  well-established  business  reporting  func-
tions,  statistical  analysis  and  data  mining  techniques  are
adopted  for  association  analysis,  data  segmentation  and
clustering,  classification  and  regression  analysis,  anomaly
detection, and predictive modeling in various business appli-
cations.  Most of these data processing and analytical tech-
nologies have already been incorporated into the leading com-
mercial BI platforms offered by major IT vendors including
Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and SAP (Sallam et al. 2011).  

Among the 13 capabilities considered essential for BI plat-
forms, according to the Gartner report by Sallam et al. (2011),
the  following  eight  are  considered  BI&A  1.0:    reporting,
dashboards, ad hoc query, search-based BI, OLAP, interactive
visualization,  scorecards,  predictive  modeling,  and  data
mining.  A few BI&A 1.0 areas are still under active devel-
opment  based  on  the  Gartner  BI  Hype  Cycle  analysis  for
emerging BI technologies, which include data mining work-
benchs, column-based DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and real-
time decision tools (Bitterer 2011).  Academic curricula in
Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) often

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

include well-structured courses such as database management
systems, data mining, and multivariate statistics.

BI&A 2.0

Since the early 2000s, the Internet and the Web began to offer
unique data collection and analytical research and develop-
ment  opportunities.    The  HTTP-based  Web  1.0  systems,
characterized  by  Web  search  engines  such  as  Google  and
Yahoo  and  e-commerce  businesses  such  as  Amazon  and
eBay, allow organizations to present their businesses online
and  interact  with  their  customers  directly.    In  addition  to
porting their traditional RDBMS-based product information
and business contents online, detailed and IP-specific user
search  and  interaction  logs  that  are  collected  seamlessly
through  cookies  and  server  logs  have  become  a  new  gold
mine for understanding customers’ needs and identifying new
business opportunities.  Web intelligence, web analytics, and
the user-generated content collected through Web 2.0-based
social  and  crowd-sourcing  systems  (Doan  et  al.  2011;
O’Reilly 2005) have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research in the 2000s, centered on text and web
analytics for unstructured web contents.

An  immense  amount  of  company,  industry,  product,  and
customer  information  can  be  gathered  from  the  web  and
organized and visualized through various text and web mining
techniques.  By analyzing customer  clickstream data logs,

web analytics tools such as Google Analytics can provide a
trail  of  the  user’s  online  activities  and  reveal  the  user’s
browsing and purchasing patterns.  Web site design, product
placement optimization, customer transaction analysis, market
structure  analysis,  and  product  recommendations  can  be
accomplished  through  web  analytics.    The  many  Web  2.0
applications developed after 2004 have also created an abun-
dance of user-generated content from various online social
media such as forums, online groups, web blogs, social net-
working sites, social multimedia sites (for photos and videos),
and even virtual worlds and social games (O’Reilly 2005).  In
addition to capturing celebrity chatter, references to everyday
events,  and  socio-political  sentiments  expressed  in  these
media, Web 2.0 applications can efficiently gather a large
volume  of  timely  feedback  and  opinions  from  a  diverse
customer population for different types of businesses.

Many  marketing  researchers  believe  that  social  media
analytics presents a unique opportunity for businesses to treat
the  market  as  a  “conversation”  between  businesses  and
customers  instead  of  the  traditional  business-to-customer,
one-way “marketing” (Lusch et al. 2010).  Unlike BI&A 1.0
technologies  that  are  already  integrated  into  commercial
enterprise IT systems, future BI&A 2.0 systems will require
the  integration  of  mature  and  scalable  techniques  in  text
mining  (e.g.,  information  extraction,  topic  identification,
opinion  mining,  question-answering),  web  mining,  social
network analysis, and spatial-temporal analysis with existing
DBMS-based BI&A 1.0 systems.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Except for basic query and search capabilities, no advanced
text  analytics  for  unstructured  content  are  currently  con-
sidered  in  the  13  capabilities  of  the  Gartner  BI  platforms.
Several, however, are listed in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle,
including  information  semantic  services,  natural  language
question answering, and content/text analytics (Bitterer 2011). 
New IS and CS courses in text mining and web mining have
emerged to address needed technical training.

BI&A 3.0

Whereas web-based BI&A 2.0 has attracted active research
from academia and industry, a new research opportunity in
BI&A  3.0  is  emerging.    As  reported  prominently  in  an
October 2011 article in The Economist (2011), the number of
mobile phones and tablets (about 480 million units) surpassed
the number of laptops and PCs (about 380 million units) for
the first time in 2011.  Although the number of PCs in use
surpassed 1 billion in 2008, the same article projected that the
number of mobile connected devices would reach 10 billion
in 2020.  Mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone, and other
smart phones and their complete ecosystems of downloadable
applicationss, from travel advisories to multi-player games,
are transforming different facets of society, from education to
healthcare and from entertainment to governments.  Other
sensor-based Internet-enabled devices equipped with RFID,
barcodes,  and  radio  tags  (the  “Internet  of  Things”)  are
opening up exciting new steams of innovative applications. 
The ability of such mobile and Internet-enabled devices to
support highly mobile, location-aware, person-centered, and
context-relevant operations and transactions will continue to
offer unique research challenges and opportunities throughout
the  2010s.    Mobile  interface,  visualization,  and  HCI
(human–computer  interaction)  design  are  also  promising
research areas.  Although the coming of the Web 3.0 (mobile
and sensor-based) era seems certain, the underlying mobile
analytics  and  location  and  context-aware  techniques  for
collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing such large-
scale and fluid mobile and sensor data are still unknown.

No integrated, commercial BI&A 3.0 systems are foreseen for
the near future.  Most of the academic research on mobile BI
is still in an embryonic stage.  Although not included in the
current  BI  platform  core  capabilities,  mobile  BI  has  been
included in the Gartner BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the
new  technologies  that  has  the  potential  to  disrupt  the  BI
market significantly (Bitterer 2011).  The uncertainty asso-
ciated  with  BI&A  3.0  presents  another  unique  research
direction for the IS community.

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0 in relation to the Gartner BI platforms core capa-
bilities and hype cycle.

The decade of the 2010s promises to be an exciting one for
high-impact BI&A research and development for both indus-
try and academia.  The business community and industry have
already taken important steps to adopt BI&A for their needs.
The IS community faces unique challenges and opportunities
in making scientific and societal impacts that are relevant and
long-lasting (Chen 2011a).  IS research and education pro-
grams need to carefully evaluate future directions, curricula,
and action plans, from BI&A 1.0 to 3.0.

BI&A Applications:  From Big
Data to Big Impact

Several global business and IT trends have helped shape past
and present BI&A research directions.  International travel,
high-speed  network  connections,  global  supply-chain,  and
outsourcing  have  created  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  IT
advancement, as predicted by Thomas Freeman in his seminal
book,  The  World  is  Flat  (2005).    In  addition  to  ultra-fast
global IT connections, the development and deployment of
business-related data standards, electronic data interchange
(EDI)  formats,  and  business  databases  and  information
systems have greatly facilitated business data creation and
utilization.  The development of the Internet in the 1970s and
the subsequent large-scale adoption of the World Wide Web
since the 1990s have increased business data generation and
collection speeds exponentially.  Recently, the Big Data era
has quietly descended on many communities, from govern-
ments  and  e-commerce  to  health  organizations.    With  an
overwhelming  amount  of  web-based,  mobile,  and  sensor-
generated data arriving at a terabyte and even exabyte scale
(The Economist 2010a, 2010b), new science, discovery, and
insights  can  be  obtained  from  the  highly  detailed,  contex-
tualized, and rich contents of relevance to any business or
organization.

In addition to being data driven, BI&A is highly applied and
can leverage opportunities presented by the abundant data and
domain-specific analytics needed in many critical and high-
impact  application  areas.    Several  of  these  promising  and
high-impact BI&A applications are presented below, with a
discussion of the data and analytics characteristics, potential
impacts, and selected illustrative examples or studies:  (1) e-
commerce  and  market  intelligence,  (2)  e-government  and
politics 2.0, (3) science and technology, (4) smart health and

well-being, and (5) security and public safety.  By carefully
analyzing the application and data characteristics, researchers
and practitioners can then adopt or develop the appropriate
analytical techniques to derive the intended impact.  In addi-
tion to technical system implementation, significant business
or  domain  knowledge  as  well  as  effective  communication
skills are needed for the successful completion of such BI&A
projects.  IS departments thus face unique opportunities and
challenges  in  developing  integrated  BI&A  research  and
education programs for the new generation of data/analytics-
savvy and business-relevant students and professionals (Chen
2011a).

E-Commerce and Market Intelligence

The excitement surrounding BI&A and Big Data has arguably
been  generated  primarily  from  the  web  and  e-commerce
communities.    Significant  market  transformation  has  been
accomplished by leading e-commerce vendors such Amazon
and  eBay  through  their  innovative  and  highly  scalable  e-
commerce  platforms  and  product  recommender  systems.
Major Internet firms such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook
continue  to  lead  the  development  of  web  analytics,  cloud
computing, and social media platforms.  The emergence of
customer-generated  Web  2.0  content  on  various  forums,
newsgroups,  social  media  platforms,  and  crowd-sourcing
systems offers another opportunity for researchers and prac-

titioners to “listen” to the voice of the market from a vast
number of business constituents that includes customers, em-
ployees, investors, and the media (Doan et al. 2011; O’Rielly
2005).  Unlike traditional transaction records collected from
various legacy systems of the 1980s, the data that e-commerce
systems collect from the web are less structured and often
contain rich customer opinion and behavioral information.

For social media analytics of customer opinions, text analysis
and  sentiment  analysis  techniques  are  frequently  adopted
(Pang and Lee 2008).  Various analytical techniques have also
been developed for product recommender systems, such as
association rule mining, database segmentation and clustering,
anomaly  detection,  and  graph  mining  (Adomavicius  and
Tuzhilin  2005).    Long-tail  marketing  accomplished  by
reaching the millions of niche markets at the shallow end of
the product bitstream has become possible via highly targeted
searches  and  personalized  recommendations  (Anderson
2004).

The  Netfix  Prize  competition2  for  the  best  collaborative
filtering algorithm to predict user movie ratings helped gener-
ate significant academic and industry interest in recommender
systems development and resulted in awarding the grand prize
of $1 million to the Bellkor’s Pragmatic Chaos team, which

surpassed Netflix’s own algorithm for predicting ratings by
10.06 percent.  However, the publicity associated with the
competition also raised major unintended customer privacy
concerns.

Much BI&A-related e-commerce research and development
information is appearing in academic IS and CS papers as
well as in popular IT magazines.

E-Government and Politics 2.0

The advent of Web 2.0 has generated much excitement for
reinventing governments.  The 2008 U.S.  House, Senate, and
presidential elections provided the first signs of success for
online  campaigning  and  political  participation.    Dubbed
“politics  2.0,”  politicians  use  the  highly  participatory  and
multimedia web platforms for successful policy discussions,
campaign advertising, voter mobilization, event announce-
ments, and online donations.  As government and political
processes become more transparent, participatory, online, and
multimedia-rich,  there  is  a  great  opportunity  for  adopting
BI&A research in e-government and politics 2.0 applications.
Selected opinion mining, social network analysis, and social
media  analytics  techniques  can  be  used  to  support  online
political  participation,  e-democracy,  political  blogs  and
forums analysis, e-government service delivery, and process
transparency  and  accountability  (Chen  2009;  Chen  et  al.
2007).  For e-government applications, semantic information
directory and ontological development (as exemplified below)
can also be developed to better serve their target citizens.  

Despite the significant transformational potential for BI&A in
e-government research, there has been less academic research
than, for example, e-commerce-related BI&A research.  E-
government research often involves researchers from political
science and public policy.  For example, Karpf (2009) ana-
lyzed the growth of the political blogosphere in the United
States and found significant innovation of existing political
institutions  in  adopting  blogging  platforms  into  their  Web
offerings. In his research, 2D blogspace mapping with com-
posite  rankings  helped  reveal  the  partisan  makeup  of  the
American  political  blogsphere.    Yang  and  Callan  (2009)
demonstrated the value for ontology development for govern-
ment  services  through  their  development  of  the  OntoCop
system, which works interactively with a user to organize and
summarize online public comments from citizens.

Science and Technology

astrophysics  and  oceanography,  to  genomics  and  environ-
mental research.  To facilitate information sharing and data
analytics, the National Science Foundation (NSF) recently
mandated  that  every  project  is  required  to  provide  a  data
management  plan.  Cyber-infrastructure,  in  particular,  has
become critical for supporting such data-sharing initiatives.  

The 2012 NSF BIGDATA3 program solicitation is an obvious
example of the U.S. government funding agency’s concerted
efforts to promote big data analytics.  The program 

aims to advance the core scientific and technological
means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, and ex-
tracting useful information from large, diverse, dis-
tributed and heterogeneous data sets so as to accel-
erate the progress of scientific discovery and innova-
tion; lead to new fields of inquiry that would not
otherwise be possible; encourage the development of
new  data  analytic  tools  and  algorithms;  facilitate
scalable, accessible, and sustainable data infrastruc-
ture;  increase  understanding  of  human  and  social
processes and interactions; and promote economic
growth and improved health and quality of life.

Several  S&T  disciplines  have  already  begun  their  journey
toward big data analytics.  For example, in biology, the NSF
funded iPlant Collaborative4 is using cyberinfrastructure to
support a community of researchers, educators, and students
working in plant sciences.  iPlant is intended to foster a new
generation  of  biologists  equipped  to  harness  rapidly  ex-
panding computational techniques and growing data sets to
address the grand challenges of plant biology. The iPlant data
set  is  diverse  and  includes  canonical  or  reference  data,
experimental data, simulation and model data, observational
data,  and  other  derived  data.    It  also  offers  various  open
source data processing and analytics tools.

In astronomy, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)5 shows
how  computational methods and big data can support and
facilitate  sense  making  and  decision  making  at  both  the
macroscopic and the microscopic level in a rapidly growing
and globalized research field.  The SDSS is one of the most
ambitious and influential surveys in the history of astronomy.

Over its eight years of operation, it has obtained deep, multi-
color images covering more than a quarter of the sky and
created three-dimensional maps containing more than 930,000
galaxies and over 120,000 quasars.  Continuing to gather data
at a rate of 200 gigabytes per night, SDSS has amassed more
than 140 terabytes of data.  The international Large Hadron
Collider  (LHC)  effort  for  high-energy  physics  is  another
example of big data, producing about 13 petabytes of data in
a year (Brumfiel 2011).

Smart Health and Wellbeing

Much like the big data opportunities facing the e-commerce
and  S&T  communities,  the  health  community  is  facing  a
tsunami of health- and healthcare-related content generated
from numerous patient care points of contact, sophisticated
medical  instruments,  and  web-based  health  communities.
Two main sources of health big data are genomics-driven big
data  (genotyping,  gene  expression,  sequencing  data)  and
payer–provider big data (electronic health records, insurance
records,  pharmacy  prescription,  patient  feedback  and
responses) (Miller 2012a).  The expected raw sequencing data
from each person is approximately four terabytes.  From the
payer–provider side, a data matrix might have hundreds of
thousands  of  patients  with  many  records  and  parameters
(demographics, medications, outcomes) collected over a long
period of time.  Extracting knowledge from health big data
poses significant research and practical challenges, especially
considering  the  HIPAA  (Health  Insurance  Portability  and
Accountability Act) and IRB (Institutional Review Board)
requirements  for  building  a  privacy-preserving  and  trust-
worthy health infrastructure and conducting ethical health-
related research (Gelfand 2011/2012).  Health big data ana-
lytics, in general, lags behind e-commerce BI&A applications
because it has rarely taken advantage of scalable analytical
methods or computational platforms (Miller 2012a).  

Over the past decade, electronic health records (EHR) have
been  widely  adopted  in  hospitals  and  clinics  worldwide.
Significant clinical knowledge and a deeper understanding of
patient disease patterns can be gleanded from such collections
(Hanauer et al. 2009; Hanauer et al. 2011; Lin et al. 2011). 
Hanauer et al. (2011), for example, used large-scale, longi-
tudinal EHR to research associations in medical diagnoses
and  consider  temporal  relations  between  events  to  better
elucidate patterns of disease progression.  Lin et al. (2011)
used  symptom–disease–treatment  (SDT)  association  rule
mining  on  a  comprehensive  EHR  of  approximately  2.1
million  records  from  a  major  hospital.    Based  on  selected
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) codes, they
were able to identify clinically relevant and accurate SDT
associations from patient records in seven distinct diseases,
ranging from cancers to chronic and infectious diseases.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

In addition to EHR, health social media sites such as Daily
Strength and PatientsLikeMe provide unique research oppor-
tunities in healthcare decision support and patient empower-
ment (Miller 2012b), especially for chronic diseases such as
diabetes, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and cancer.  Association
rule mining and clustering, health social media monitoring
and analysis, health text analytics, health ontologies, patient
network analysis, and adverse drug side-effect analysis are
promising areas of research in health-related BI&A.  Due to
the  importance  of  HIPAA  regulations,  privacy-preserving
health data mining is also gaining attention (Gelfand 2011/
2012).

Partially funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH),
the NSF BIGDATA program solicitation includes common
interests in big data across NSF and NIH.  Clinical decision
making, patient-centered therapy, and knowledge bases for
health, disease, genome, and environment are some of the
areas in which BI&A techniques can contribute (Chen 2011b;
Wactlar et al. 2011).  Another recent, major NSF initiative
related to health big data analytics is the NSF Smart Health
and  Wellbeing  (SHB)6  program,  which  seeks  to  address
fundamental technical and scientific issues that would support
a much-needed transformation of healthcare from reactive and
hospital-centered  to  preventive,  proactive,  evidence-based,
person-centered, and focused on wellbeing rather than disease
control.  The SHB research topics include sensor technology,
networking, information and machine learning technology,
modeling cognitive processes, system and process modeling,
and social and economic issues (Wactlar et al. 2011), most of
which are relevant to healthcare BI&A.

Security and Public Safety

Since  the  tragic  events  of  September  11,  2001,  security
research  has  gained  much  attention,  especially  given  the
increasing dependency of business and our global society on
digital enablement.  Researchers in computational science,
information systems, social sciences, engineering, medicine,
and many other fields have been called upon to help enhance
our ability to fight violence, terrorism, cyber crimes, and other
cyber security concerns.  Critical mission areas have been
identified where information technology can contribute, as
suggested in the U.S. Office of Homeland Security’s report
“National Strategy for Homeland Security,” released in 2002,
including intelligence and warning, border and transportation

security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical infra-
structure (including cyberspace), defending against catastro-
phic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and response.
Facing  the  critical  missions  of  international  security  and
various data and technical challenges, the need to develop the
science  of  “security  informatics”  was  recognized,  with  its
main objective being the 

development of advanced information technologies,
systems,  algorithms,  and  databases  for  security-
related applications, through an integrated techno-
logical, organizational, and policy-based approach
(Chen 2006, p. 7).

BI&A has much to contribute to the emerging field of security
informatics.

Security issues are a major concern for most organizations.
According to the research firm International Data Corpora-
tion, large companies are expected to spend $32.8 billion in
computer  security  in  2012,  and  small-  and  medium-size
companies  will  spend  more  on  security  than  on  other  IT
purchases over the next three years (Perlroth and Rusli 2012).
In  academia,  several  security-related  disciplines  such  as
computer security, computational criminology, and terrorism
informatics are also flourishing (Brantingham 2011; Chen et
al. 2008).

Intelligence, security, and public safety agencies are gathering
large amounts of data from multiple sources, from criminal
records of terrorism incidents, and from cyber security threats
to multilingual open-source intelligence.  Companies of dif-
ferent sizes are facing the daunting task of defending against
cybersecurity threats and protecting their intellectual assets
and infrastructure.  Processing and analyzing security-related
data, however, is increasingly difficult.  A significant chal-
lenge in security IT research is the information stovepipe and
overload resulting from diverse data sources, multiple data
formats, and large data volumes.  Current research on tech-
nologies  for  cybersecurity,  counter-terrorism,  and  crime-
fighting  applications  lacks  a  consistent  framework  for
addressing these data challenges.  Selected BI&A technol-
ogies such as criminal association rule mining and clustering,
criminal  network  analysis,  spatial-temporal  analysis  and
visualization, multilingual text analytics, sentiment and affect
analysis, and cyber attacks analysis and attribution should be
considered for security informatics research.

The  University  of  Arizona’s  COPLINK  and  Dark  Web
research programs offer significant examples of crime data
mining and terrorism informatics within the IS community
(Chen 2006, 2012).  The COPLINK information sharing and

crime data mining system, initially developed with funding
from NSF and the Department of Justice, is currently in use
by more than 4,500 police agencies in the United States and
by 25 NATO countries, and was acquired by IBM in 2011. 
The Dark Web research, funded by NSF and the Department
of Defense (DOD), has generated one of the largest known
academic terrorism research databases (about 20 terabytes of
terrorist web sites and social media content) and generated
advanced multilingual social media analytics techniques.

Recognizing  the  challenges  presented  by  the  volume  and
complexity  of  defense-related  big  data,  the  U.S.  Defense
Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) within DOD
initiated the XDATA program in 2012 to help develop com-
putational techniques and software tools for processing and
analyzing the vast amount of mission-oriented information for
defense  activities.    XDATA  aims  to  address  the  need  for
scalable  algorithms  for  processing  and  visualization  of
imperfect and incomplete data. The program engages applied
mathematics, computer science, and data visualization com-
munities to develop big data analytics and usability solutions
for warfighters.7  BI&A researchers could contribute signifi-
cantly in this area.

Table 2 summarizes these promising BI&A applications, data
characteristics, analytics techniques, and potential impacts.

BI&A Research Framework:
Foundational Technologies and
Emerging Research in Analytics

The  opportunities  with  the  abovementioned  emerging  and
high-impact  applications  have  generated  a  great  deal  of
excitement within both the BI&A industry and the research
community.  Whereas industry focuses on scalable and inte-
grated systems and implementations for applications in dif-
ferent  organizations,  the  academic  community  needs  to
continue to advance the key technologies in analytics.

Emerging analytics research opportunities can be classified
into five critical technical areas—(big) data analytics, text
analytics,  web  analytics,  network  analytics,  and  mobile
analytics—all of which can contribute to to BI&A 1.0, 2.0,
and 3.0.  The classification of these five topic areas is intended

to highlight the key characteristics of each area; however, a
few  of  these  areas  may  leverage  similar  underlying  tech-
nologies.  In each analytics area we present the foundational
technologies that are mature and well developed and suggest
selected emerging research areas (see Table 3).

(Big) Data Analytics

Data  analytics  refers  to  the  BI&A  technologies  that  are
grounded mostly in data mining and statistical analysis.  As
mentioned previously, most of these techniques rely on the
mature commercial technologies of relational DBMS, data
warehousing, ETL, OLAP, and BPM (Chaudhuri et al. 2011).

Since the late 1980s, various data mining algorithms have
been developed by researchers from the artificial intelligence,
algorithm,  and  database  communities.    In  the  IEEE  2006
International  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM),  the  10
most influential data mining algorithms were identified based
on  expert  nominations,  citation  counts,  and  a  community
survey.    In  ranked  order,  they  are  C4.5,  k-means,  SVM
(support vector machine), Apriori, EM (expectation maximi-
zation),  PageRank,  AdaBoost,  kNN  (k-nearest  neighbors),
Naïve Bayes, and CART (Wu et al. 2007).  These algorithms
cover classification, clustering, regression, association analy-
sis, and network analysis.  Most of these popular data mining
algorithms have been incorporated in commercial and open
source  data  mining  systems  (Witten  et  al.  2011).    Other

1174

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

advances such as neural networks for classification/prediction
and clustering and genetic algorithms for optimization and
machine learning have all contributed to the success of data
mining in different applications.

Two  other  data  analytics  approaches  commonly  taught  in
business  school  are  also  critical  for  BI&A.    Grounded  in
statistical theories and models, multivariate statistical analysis
covers analytical techniques such as regression, factor analy-
sis, clustering, and discriminant analysis that have been used
successfully in various business applications.  Developed in
the management science community, optimization techniques
and heuristic search are also suitable for selected BI&A prob-
lems such as database feature selection and web crawling/
spidering.  Most of these techniques can be found in business
school curricula.

Due to the success achieved collectively by the data mining
and statistical analysis community, data analytics continues to
be an active area of research.  Statistical machine learning,
often  based  on  well-grounded  mathematical  models  and
powerful algorithms, techniques such as Bayesian networks,
Hidden Markov models, support vector machine, reinforce-
ment learning, and ensemble models, have been applied to
data, text, and web analytics applications.  Other new data
analytics techniques explore and leverage unique data charac-
teristics, from sequential/temporal mining and spatial mining,
to data mining for high-speed data streams and sensor data.
Increased  privacy  concerns  in  various  e-commerce,  e-
government, and healthcare applications have caused privacy-
preserving  data  mining  to  become  an  emerging  area  of
research.  Many of these methods are data-driven, relying on
various anonymization techniques, while others are process-
driven, defining how data can be accessed and used (Gelfand
2011/ 2012). Over the past decade, process mining has also
emerged as a new research field that focuses on the analysis
of processes using event data.  Process mining has become
possible  due  to  the  availability  of  event  logs  in  various
industries (e.g., healthcare, supply chains) and new process
discovery  and  conformance  checking  techniques  (van  der
Aalst 2012). Furthermore, network data and web content have
helped generate exciting research in network analytics and
web analytics, which are presented below.

In  addition  to  active  academic  research  on  data  analytics,
industry research and development has also generated much
excitement, especially with respect to big data analytics for
semi-structured content.  Unlike the structured data that can
be handled repeatedly through a RDBMS,  semi-structured
data may call for ad hoc and one-time extraction, parsing,
processing,  indexing,  and  analytics  in  a  scalable  and  dis-
tributed MapReduce or Hadoop environment.  MapReduce

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

has been hailed as a revolutionary new platform for large-
scale,  massively  parallel  data  access  (Patterson  2008).
Inspired  in  part  by  MapReduce,  Hadoop  provides  a  Java-
based software framework for distributed processing of data-
intensive transformation and analytics.  The top three com-
mercial database suppliers—Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft—
have all adopted Hadoop, some within a cloud infrastructure. 
The open source Apache Hadoop has also gained significant
traction  for  business  analytics,  including  Chukwa  for  data
collection, HBase for distributed data storage, Hive for data
summarization  and  ad  hoc  querying,  and  Mahout  for  data
mining (Henschen 2011).  In their perspective paper, Stone-
braker et al. (2010) compared MapReduce with the parallel
DBMS.  The commercial parallel DBMS showed clear advan-
tages  in  efficient  query  processing  and  high-level  query
language and interface, whereas MapReduce excelled in ETL
and analytics for “read only” semi-structured data sets.  New
Hadoop-  and  MapReduce-based  systems  have  become
another viable option for big data analytics in addition to the
commercial systems developed for RDBMS, column-based
DBMS, in-memory DBMS, and parallel DBMS (Chaudhuri
et al. 2011).

Text Analytics

A significant portion of the unstructured content collected by
an  organization  is  in  textual  format,  from  e-mail  commu-
nication and corporate documents to web pages and social
media  content.    Text  analytics  has  its  academic  roots  in
information retrieval and computational linguistics.  In infor-
mation  retrieval,  document  representation  and  query  pro-
cessing are the foundations for developing the vector-space
model, Boolean retrieval model, and probabilistic retrieval
model, which in turn, became the basis for the modern digital
libraries,  search  engines,  and  enterprise  search  systems
(Salton 1989).  In computational linguistics, statistical natural
language processing (NLP) techniques for lexical acquisition,
word sense disambiguation, part-of-speech-tagging (POST),
and probabilistic context-free grammars have also become
important for representing text (Manning and Schütze 1999).
In  addition  to  document  and  query  representations,  user
models  and  relevance  feedback  are  also  important  in
enhancing search performance.

Since  the  early  1990s,  search  engines  have  evolved  into
mature  commercial  systems,  consisting  of  fast,  distributed
crawling;  efficient  inverted  indexing;  inlink-based  page
ranking; and search logs analytics.  Many of these founda-
tional  text  processing  and  indexing  techniques  have  been
deployed  in  text-based  enterprise  search  and  document
management systems in BI&A 1.0.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Leveraging the power of big data (for training) and statistical
NLP (for building language models), text analytics techniques
have  been  actively  pursued  in  several  emerging  areas,
including  information  extraction,  topic  models,  question-
answering (Q/A), and opinion mining.  Information extraction
is  an  area  of  research  that  aims  to  automatically  extract
specific kinds of structured information from documents.  As
a  building  block  of  information  extraction,  NER  (named
entity  recognition,  also  known  as  entity  extraction)  is  a
process that identifies atomic elements in text and classifies
them into predefined categories (e.g., names, places, dates).
NER techniques have been successfully developed for news
analysis and biomedical applications.  Topic models are algo-
rithms for discovering the main themes that pervade a large
and otherwise unstructured collection of documents.  New
topic  modeling  algorithms  such  as  LDA  (latent  Dirichlet
allocation)  and  other  probabilistic  models  have  attracted
recent research (Blei 2012).  Question answering (Q/A) sys-
tems rely on techniques from NLP, information retrieval, and
human–computer interaction.  Primarily designed to answer
factual questions (i.e., who, what, when, and where kinds of
questions),  Q/A  systems  involve  different  techniques  for
question  analysis,  source  retrieval,  answer  extraction,  and
answer presentation (Maybury 2004).  The recent successes
of  IBM’s  Watson  and  Apple’s  Siri  have  highlighted  Q/A
research  and  commercialization  opportunities.    Many  pro-
mising Q/A system application areas have been identified,
including education, health, and defense.  Opinion mining
refers to the computational techniques for extracting, classi-
fying, understanding, and assessing the opinions expressed in
various  online  news  sources,  social  media  comments,  and
other user-generated contents.  Sentiment analysis is often
used in opinion mining to identify sentiment, affect, subjec-
tivity, and other emotional states in online text.  Web 2.0 and
social  media  content  have  created  abundant  and  exciting
opportunities for understanding the opinions of the general
public and consumers regarding social events, political move-
ments, company strategies, marketing campaigns, and product
preferences (Pang and Lee 2008).

In addition to the above research directions, text analytics also
offers  significant  research  opportunities  and  challenges  in
several  more  focused  areas,  including  web  stylometric
analysis for authorship attribution, multilingual analysis for
web documents, and large-scale text visualization.  Multi-
media information retrieval and mobile information retrieval
are  two  other  related  areas  that  require  support  of  text
analytics techniques, in addition to the core multimedia and
mobile  technologies.    Similar  to  big  data  analytics,  text
analytics using MapReduce, Hadoop, and cloud services will
continue to foster active research directions in both academia
and industry.

Web Analytics

Over the past decade, web analytics has emerged as an active
field of research within BI&A.  Building on the data mining
and statistical analysis foundations of data analytics and on
the information retrieval and NLP models in text analytics,
web  analytics  offers  unique  analytical  challenges  and
opportunities.  HTTP/HTML-based hyperlinked web sites and
associated  web  search  engines  and  directory  systems  for
locating web content have helped develop unique Internet-
based technologies for web site crawling/spidering, web page
updating, web site ranking, and search log analysis.  Web log
analysis  based  on  customer  transactions  has  subsequently
turned into active research in recommender systems.  How-
ever, web analytics has become even more exciting with the
maturity and popularity of web services and Web 2.0 systems
in the mid-2000s (O’Reilly 2005).  

Based on XML and Internet protocols (HTTP, SMTP), web
services offer a new way of reusing and integrating third party
or  legacy  systems.    New  types  of  web  services  and  their
associated APIs (application programming interface) allow
developers to easily integrate diverse content from different
web-enabled  system,  for  example,  REST  (representational
state  transfer)  for  invoking  remote  services,  RSS  (really
simple syndication) for news “pushing,” JSON (JavaScript
object notation) for lightweight data-interchange, and AJAX
(asynchronous JavaScript + XML) for data interchange and
dynamic  display.    Such  lightweight  programming  models
support data syndication and notification and “mashups” of
multimedia  content  (e.g.,  Flickr,  Youtube,  Google  Maps)
from different web sources—a process somewhat similar to
ETL  (extraction,  transformation,  and  load)  in  BI&A  1.0.
Most of the e-commerce vendors have provided mature APIs
for accessing their product and customer content (Schonfeld
2005).  For example, through Amazon Web Services, devel-
opers  can  access  product  catalog,  customer  reviews,  site
ranking, historical pricing, and the Amazon Elastic Compute
Cloud (EC2) for computing capacity.  Similarly, Google web
APIs  support  AJAX  search,  Map  API,  GData  API  (for
Calendar, Gmail, etc.), Google Translate, and Google App
Engine for cloud computing resources.  Web services and
APIs  continue  to  provide  an  exciting  stream  of  new  data
sources for BI&A 2.0 research.

A major emerging component in web analytics research is the
development  of  cloud  computing  platforms  and  services,
which include applications, system software, and hardware
delivered as services over the Internet.  Based on service-
oriented architecture (SOA), server virtualization, and utility
computing, cloud computing can be offered as software as a

service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), or platform
as a service (PaaS).  Only a few leading IT vendors are cur-
rently positioned to support high-end, high-throughput BI&A
applications using cloud computing.  For example, Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) enables users to rent virtual
computers on which to run their own computer applications. 
Its Simple Storage Service (S3) provides online storage web
service.  Google App Engine provides a platform for devel-
oping and hosting Java or Python-based web applications. 
Google Bigtable is used for backend data storage. Microsoft’s
Windows  Azure  platform  provides  cloud  services  such  as
SQL  Azure  and  SharePoint,  and  allows  .Net  framework
applications to run on the platform.  The industry-led web and
cloud services offer unique data collection, processing, and
analytics challenges for BI&A researchers.

In academia, current web analytics related research encom-
passes social search and mining, reputation systems, social
media analytics, and web visualization.  In addition, web-
based auctions, Internet monetization, social marketing, and
web  privacy/security  are  some  of  the  promising  research
directions related to web analytics.  Many of these emerging
research areas may rely on advances in social network analy-
sis, text analytics, and even economics modeling research.

Network Analytics

Network analytics is a nascent research area that has evolved
from the earlier citation-based bibliometric analysis to include
new computational models for online community and social
network analysis.  Grounded in bibliometric analysis, citation
networks and coauthorship networks have long been adopted
to examine scientific impact and knowledge diffusion.  The
h-index is a good example of a citation metric that aims to
measure the productivity and impact of the published work of
a scientist or scholar (Hirsch 2005).  Since the early 2000s,
network science has begun to advance rapidly with contri-
butions  from  sociologists,  mathematicians,  and  computer
scientists.  Various social network theories, network metrics,
topology, and mathematical models have been developed that
help understand network properties and relationships (e.g.,
centrality, betweenness, cliques, paths; ties, structural holes,
structural  balance;  random  network,  small-world  network,
scale-free network) (Barabási 2003; Watts 2003).

Recent network analytics research has focused on areas such
as link mining and community detection.  In link mining, one
seeks to discover or predict links between nodes of a network.
Within a network, nodes may represent customers, end users,
products and/or services, and the links between nodes may

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

represent social relationships, collaboration, e-mail exchanges,
or product adoptions.  One can conduct link mining using
only the topology information (Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg
2007).    Techniques  such  as  common  neighbors,  Jaccard’s
coefficient,  Adamic  Adar  measure,  and  Katz  measure  are
popular  for  predicting  missing  or  future  links.    The  link
mining accuracy can be further improved when the node and
link attributes are considered.  Community detection is also an
active research area of relevance to BI&A (Fortunato 2010). 
By  representing  networks  as  graphs,  one  can  apply  graph
partitioning algorithms to find a minimal cut to obtain dense
subgraphs representing user communities. 

Many  techniques  have  been  developed  to  help  study  the
dynamic nature of social networks.  For example, agent-based
models (sometimes referred to as multi-agent systems) have
been used to study disease contact networks and criminal or
terrorist networks (National Research Council 2008).  Such
models simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous
agents  (of  either  individual  or  collective  entities  such  as
organizations  or  groups)  with  the  intent  of  assessing  their
effects on the system as a whole.  Social influence and infor-
mation  diffusion  models  are  also  viable  techniques  for
studying evolving networks.  Some research is particularly
relevant to opinion and information dynamics of a society. 
Such dynamics hold many qualitative similarities to disease
infections  (Bettencourt  et  al.  2006).    Another  network
analytics technique that has drawn attention in recent years is
the  use  of  exponential  random  graph  models  (Frank  and
Strauss 1986; Robins et al. 2007). ERGMs are a family of
statistical models for analyzing data about social and other
networks.  To support statistical inference on the processes
influencing  the  formation  of  network  structure,  ERGMs
consider the set of all possible alternative networks weighted
on their similarity to an observed network.  In addition to
studying traditional friendship or disease networks, ERGMs
are  promising  for  understanding  the  underlying  network
propertities  that  cause  the  formation  and  evolution  of
customer, citizen, or patient networks for BI&A.

Most of the abovementioned network analytics techniques are
not part of the existing commercial BI&A platforms.  Signifi-
cant open-source development efforts are underway from the
social network analysis community.  Tools such as UCINet
(Borgatti et al. 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj and Mrvar 1998)
have  been  developed  and  are  widely  used  for  large-scale
network analysis and visualization.  New network analytics
tools such as ERGM have also been made available to the
academic  community  (Hunter  et  al.  2008).    Online  virtual
communities,  criminal  and  terrorist  networks,  social  and
political networks, and trust and reputation networks are some
of the promising new applications for network analytics.

Mobile Analytics 

As an effective channel for reaching many users  and as a
means  of  increasing  the  productivity  and  efficiency  of  an
organization’s  workforce,  mobile  computing  is  viewed  by
respondents of the recent IBM technology trends survey (IBM
2011)  as  the  second  most  “in  demand”  area  for  software
development.  Mobile BI was also considered by the Gartner
BI Hype Cycle analysis as one of the new technologies that
have the potential to drastically disrupt the BI market (Bitterer
2011).  According to eMarketer, the market for mobile ads is
expected to explode, soaring from an estimated $2.6 billion in
2012 to $10.8 billion in 2016 (Snider 2012).

Mobile computing offers a means for IT professional growth
as more and more organizations build applications.  With its
large  and  growing  global  install  base,  Android  has  been
ranked as the top mobile platform since 2010.  This  open
source  platform,  based  on  Java  and  XML,  offers  a  much
shorter learning curve and this contributes to its popularity
with  IT  professionals:    70  percent  of  the  IBM  survey
respondents planned to use Android as their mobile develop-
ment platform, while 49 percent planned to use iOS and 35
percent planned to use Windows 7.  The ability to collect fine-
grained, location-specific, context-aware, highly personalized
content through these smart devices has opened new possi-
bilities for advanced and innovative BI&A opportunities.  In
addition to the hardware and content advantages, the unique
apps ecosystem developed through the volunteer community
of  mobile  app  developers  offers  a  new  avenue  for  BI&A
research.    The  Apple  App  Store  alone  offers  more  than
500,000 apps in almost any conceivable category as of August
2012;8 the number of Android apps also reached 500,000 in
August 2012.9  Many different revenue models have begun to
emerge for mobile apps, from paid or free but ad-supported
apps to mobile gamification, which incentivizes participants
(e.g., users or employees) by giving rewards for contributions
(Snider 2012).  For mobile BI, companies are considering
enterprise apps, industry-specific apps, e-commerce apps, and
social apps (in ranked order) according to the IBM survey.

The  lightweight  programming  models  of  the  current  web
services (e.g., HTML, XML, CSS, Ajax, Flash, J2E) and the
maturing mobile development platforms such as Android and
iOS have contributed to the rapid development of mobile web
services (e.g., HTML5, Mobile Ajax, Mobile Flash, J2ME) in

various mobile pervasive applications, from disaster manage-
ment to healthcare support.  New mobile analytics research is
emerging in different areas (e.g., mobile sensing apps that are
location-aware and activity-sensitive; mobile social innova-
tion for m-health and m-learning; mobile social networking
and crowd-sourcing; mobile visualization/HCI; and personali-
zation and behavioral modeling for mobile apps).  In addition,
social,  behavioral,  and  economic  models  for  gamification,
mobile advertising, and social marketing are under way and
may  contribute  to  the  development  of  future  BI&A  3.0
systems.

Mapping the BI&A Knowledge
Landscape:  A Bibliometric Study of
Academic and Industry Publications

In an effort to better understand the current state of BI&A
related research and identify future sources of knowledge, we
conducted a bibliometric study analyzing relevant literature,
major BI&A scholars, disciplines and publications, and key
research topics.  A collection, transformation, and analytics
process was followed in the study, much like a typical BI&A
process adopted in other applications.  

To discern research trends in BI&A, related literature from
the  past  decade  (2000–2011)  was  collected.    Relevant  IT
publications  were  identified  from  several  large-scale  and
reputable  digital  libraries:    Web  of  Science  (Thomson
Reuters,  covering  more  than  12,000  of  the  highest  impact
journals in sciences, engineering, and humanities), Business
Source Complete (EBSCO, covering peer-reviewed business
journals as well as non-journal content such as industry/trade
magazines), IEEE Xplore (Institute of Electrical and Elec-
tronics  Engineers,  providing  access  to  the  IEEE  digital
library), ScienceDirect (Elsevier, covering over 2,500 journals
from  the  scientific,  technical,  and  medical  literature),  and
Engineering Village (Elsevier, used to retrieve selected ACM
conference papers because the ACM Digital Library interface
does not support automated downloading).  These sources
contain high-quality bibliometric metadata, including journal
name and date, author name and institution, and article title
and abstract.

To ensure data consistency and relevance across our collec-
tion, we retrieved only those publications that contained the
keywords  business  intelligence,  business  analytics,  or  big
data  within  their  title,  abstract,  or  subject  indexing  (when
applicable).  The choice of these three keywords was intended
to focus our search and analysis on publications of direct rele-
vance to our interest.  However, this search procedure may

also omit articles that use other BI&A relevant terms (e.g.,
data  warehousing,  data  mining)  but  not  the  three  specific
keywords in the title or abstract.  This kind of limitation is
common  in  bibliometric  studies.    The  collected  data  was
exported as XML records and parsed into a relational data-
base  (SQL  Server)  for  analysis.    The  number  of  records
initially retrieved totaled 6,187 papers.  After removing dupli-
cates, the number of unique records totaled 3,602.

Figure 2 shows the statistics and growth trends of publications
relating to the three search keywords.  Overall, business intel-
ligence had the largest coverage and the longest history. This
is  consistent  with  the  evolution  of  BI&A,  as  the  term  BI
appeared first in the early 1990s.  In our collection, business
analytics  and  big  data  began  to  appear  in  the  literature  in
2001, but only gained much attention after about 2007.  The
business  intelligence  related  publications  numbered  3,146,
whereas  business  analytics  and  big  data  publications  each
numbered only 213 and 243, respectively.  While the overall
publication  trend  for  business  intelligence  remains  stable,
business analytics and big data publications have seen a faster
growth pattern in recent years.

Knowledge of the most popular publications, as well as pro-
lific  authors,  is  beneficial  for  understanding  an  emerging
research discipline.  Table 4 summarizes the top 20 journals,
conferences, and industry magazines with BI&A publications.
(The top 20 academic BI&A authors are identified in Table 6.)

Overall, the largest source of academic business intelligence
publications was academic conferences.  The Conference on
Business  Intelligence  and  Financial  Engineering  (#1)  and
Conference on Electronic Commerce and Business Intelli-
gence (#3) are specialized academic conferences devoted to
business intelligence.  One IS conference ranks #2 in the top-
20 list:  Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences
(HICSS), with 370 publications.10  IEEE holds the majority of
conferences on the list through various outlets; several are
related  to  emerging  technical  areas,  such  as  data  mining,
Internet computing, and cloud computing.  The IEEE Inter-
national  Conference  on  Data  Mining  (ICDM)  is  highly
regarded and ranks #5.  ACM has two publications in the top-
20 list:  Communications of the ACM and the ACM SIGKDD
International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data
Mining.  Both are well-known in CS.  Again, the data mining
community  has  contributed  significantly  to  BI&A.    Other
technical conferences in CS are also contributing to BI&A in
areas such as computational intelligence, web intelligence,
evolutionary computation, and natural language processing,
all of which are critical for developing future data, text, and
web analytics techniques discussed in our research frame-

10Two major IS conferences, ICIS (International Conference on Information
Systems) and WITS (Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems)
may have also published significant BI&A research; however, their collec-
tions are not covered in the five major digital libraries to which we have
access and thus are not included in this analysis.

work.  Journals are somewhat more limited in their publi-
cation  volume,  although  it  is  notable  that  the  IS  journal
Decision Support Systems made the top 20 list (at #9).  A few
business school journals also contain related BI&A research
in areas such as business ethics, marketing, and technology
management.    Other  major  IS  publications  also  published
business intelligence related articles, but at a lower rate than
the aforementioned sources (see Table 5).  Relevant sources
from industry tend to be general IT publications, without a
specific BI focus (e.g., ComputerWorld at #1, Information
Today  at  #2,  and  InformationWeek  at  #3),  as  shown  in
Table 4.  However, there are some focused sources as well,
such as Microsoft Data Mining (#5), KM World (#8), and
CRM Magazine (#12), that are more relevant to the BI&A
related topics of data mining, knowledge management, and
customer relation management.  KM and CRM have tradi-
tionally been topics of interest to IS scholars.

Table 6 summarizes the top-20 academic authors with BI&A
publications.  Most of these authors are from IS and CS, with
several others from the related fields of marketing, manage-
ment,  communication,  and  mathematics.    Many  of  these
authors are close collaborators, for example, Hsinchun Chen
(#1),  Jay  F.  Nunamaker  (#18),  Michael  Chau  (#11),  and
Wingyan  Chung  (#18)  through  the  University  of  Arizona
connection,11  and  Barabara  H.  Wixom  (#5)  and  Hugh  J.
Watson (#5) through the University of Georgia connection.
We also report the PageRank score (Brin and Page 1998), a
popular metric for data and network analytics, for the BI&A
authors  based  on  the  coauthorship  network  within  BI&A
publications.  A higher PageRank score captures an author’s
propensity to collaborate with other prolific authors.  The

analysis  reveals broad and even contribution of authors from
North America, Asia, Europe, and Australia, reflecting the
diversity and international interest in the field of BI&A.

The  last  set  of  analyses  investigated  the  content  of  BI&A
publications from 2000–2011.  Mallet (McCallum 2002), a
Java-based open-source NLP text analytics tool, was used to
extract the top bigrams (two-word phrases) for each year.  A
few bi-grams were combined to form more meaningful BI-

related trigrams such as “customer relation management” and
“enterprise resource planning.”  These keywords were then
ranked based on their frequency, and the top 30 keywords
displayed using the tagcloud visualization.  More important
keywords  are  highlighted  with  larger  fonts  as  shown  in
Figure 3.  For example, competitive advantage, big data, data
warehousing, and decision support emerged as the top four
topics in the BI&A literature.  Other BI&A related topics such
as customer relation management, data mining, competitive

intelligence,  enterprise  resource  planning,  and  knowledge
management were also highly ranked.  Overall, the topics
extracted were highly relevant to BI&A, especially for its
managerial  and  application  values,  although  most  of  the
detailed technical terms, as described in the previous research
framework sections, were not present.  This could be attri-
buted to the tendency of authors to use broad terminologies in
article titles and abstracts.

BI&A Education and Program
Development

BI&A provides opportunities not only for the research com-
munity, but also for education and program development.  In
July  2012,  Columbia  University  and  New  York  City
announced plans to invest over $80 million dollars in a new
Center  for  Data  Science,  which  is  expected  to  generate
thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in tax revenues from
100 startup companies over the next 10 years  (Associated
Press 2012).  BI&A is data science in business.  Job postings
seeking  data  scientists  and  business  analytics  specialists
abound these days.  There is a clear shortage of professionals
with the “deep” knowledge required to manage the three V’s
of big data:  volume, velocity, and variety (Russom 2011).
There is also an increasing demand for individuals with the
deep knowledge needed to manage the three “perspectives” of
business decision making:  descriptive, predictive, and pre-
scriptive analytics.  In this section, we describe BI&A educa-
tion  in  business  schools,  present  the  challenges  facing  IS
departments, and discuss BI&A program development oppor-
tunities.  We also provide some suggestions for the IS disci-
pline in addressing these challenges (Chiang et al. 2012).

Education Challenges

BI&A focuses on understanding, interpretation, strategizing,
and taking action to further organizational interests.  Several
academic disciplines have contributed to BI&A, including IS,
CS, Statistics, Management, and Marketing, as shown in our
bibliometric study.  IS programs, in particular, are uniquely
positioned to train a new generation of scholars and students
due to their emphasis on key data management and infor-
mation technologies, business-oriented statistical analysis and
management science techniques, and broad business disci-
pline exposure (e.g., Finance, Accounting, Marketing, and
Economics).

Since  its  inception  approximately  45  years  ago,  IS  as  an
academic discipline has primarily focused on business needs
in an era when the major challenges involved the management
of internal business and transaction data.  In the age of big
data, these problems remain, but the emphasis in industry has
shifted to data analysis and rapid business decision making
based on huge volumes of information.  Such time-critical
decision making largely takes place outside of the IS function
(i.e.,  in  business  units  such  as  marketing,  finance,  and
logistics).  Can IS programs serve the needs of these business
decision makers?  Can we provide courses in data mining,
text mining, opinion mining, social media/network analytics,
web  mining,  and  predictive  analytics  that  are  required  for
marketing and finance majors?  We should also ask ourselves
about the skill sets needed by students.  Should we recruit
students with strong math and statistical skills, for example?
We contend that a new vision for IS, or at least for some IS
programs, should address these questions.

BI&A presents a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools to position themselves as a viable option  for edu-

cating professionals with the necessary depth and academic
rigor to tackle the increased complexity of BI&A issues.  IS
programs housed within business schools have access to a
variety of business courses, as well as courses intended to
improve communication and presentation skills.  It is also
common for business schools to house management science
and statistics faculty in the same IS unit.

BI&A Knowledge and Skills

BI&A education should be interdisciplinary and cover critical
analytical and IT skills, business and domain knowledge, and
communication  skills  required  in  a  complex  data-centric
business environment.

Analytical and IT skills include a variety of evolving topics. 
They  are  drawn  from  disciplines  such  as  statistics  and
computer science for managing and analyzing both structured
data and unstructured text.  Coverage of these topics ranges
from  BI&A  1.0  to  BI&A  3.0.    The  academic  programs
intended  to  produce  BI&A  professionals  should  consider
these analytical and IT skills as suggested in Table 3 of our
research framework.

To provide useful insights and decision-making support, the
BI&A professionals must be capable of understanding the
business issues and framing the appropriate analytical solu-
tions.  The necessary business knowledge for BI&A profes-
sionals  ranges  from  general  familiarity  with  the  areas  of
Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Logistics, and
Operation Management, to the domain knowledge required in
specific  BI&A  applications,  some  of  which  are  discussed
earlier and summarized in Table 2.

The importance of an organization-wide culture for informed
fact-based decision making for business analytics is empha-
sized by Davenport (2006).  To support such a culture, BI&A
professionals need to know not only how to turn raw data and
information (through analytics) into meaningful and action-
able knowledge for an organization, but also how to properly
interact with and communicate this knowledge to the business
and domain experts of the organization.

Program Development

BI&A provides a unique opportunity for IS units in business
schools  to  develop  new  courses,  certificate  programs,  and
degree programs charged with preparing the next generation
of analytical thinkers.  There are many options for delivering
BI&A  education.    Because  of  the  depth  of  knowledge
required, graduate programs are the obvious choice.  Viable

The  first  option  requires  the  effort  of  developing  a  new
program.  A few universities have embarked on this endeavor.
A nonexhaustive list includes North Carolina State Univer-
sity, Saint Joseph’s University, Northwestern University, the
University of Denver, Stevens Institute of Technology, and
Fordham University.  New York University will launch its
new program in May 2013.  New MS degree programs can be
designed explicitly to attract analytically strong students with
undergraduate degrees in areas such as mathematics, science,
and  computer  science,  and  to  prepare  these  students  for
careers, not only in the IS or IT groups in industry, but also in
functional areas such as research and development, marketing,
media, logistics, and finance.

The second option leverages existing MS IS programs with a
BI&A  concentration  that  would  supplement  the  already
existing curriculum in IT, data management, and business and
communication courses with additional analytics coverage. 
This  option  has  been  adopted  by  a  number  of  schools
including the IS departments at Carnegie Mellon University
and the University of Arizona.  This option provides BI&A
knowledge  and  skills  for  students  who  will  primarily  find
careers in IS groups in industry.

For working IT professionals who wish to expand into BI&A,
a part-time MS or certificate program (the third option) offer
practical and valid alternatives.  These certificate programs
can be delivered online or on-site and need to provide the
skills that will complement the current IT or business experi-
ence of IT professionals, and/or provide technical and analy-
tical skills to business professionals in non-IT areas.  Online
programs that are currently available include Northwestern
University’s MS in Predictive Analytics and Stanford Univer-
sity’s Graduate Certificate on Mining Big Data.  In addition,
IS programs can help design a BI&A concentration in MBA
programs  to  help  train  a  new  generation  of  data-  and
analytics-savvy managers.

A  key  to  success  for  a  BI&A  program  is  to  integrate  the
concept of “learning by doing” in the BI&A curriculum via
hands-on projects, internships, and industry-guided practicum. 
Big  data  analytics  requires  trial-and-error  and  experimen-
tation.  Strong relationships and partnerships between aca-
demic programs and industry partners are critical to foster the
experiential learning aspect of the BI&A curriculum.

Papers in this Special Issue

The  idea  for  this  special  issue  began  in  May  2009,  when
Detmar Straub, the Editor-in-Chief of MIS Quarterly, soli-
cited suggestions for special issues from the editorial board
members.  We submitted the special issue proposal on Busi-
ness Intelligence Research in August 2009, with the call-for-
papers approved and distributed at the 30th Annual Interna-
tional Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in Decem-
ber of that year.  Submissions to this special issue needed to
relate  to  MIS  Quarterly’s  mission  with  strong  managerial,
organizational, and societal relevance and impact. In addition
to the Design Science approach (Hevner et al. 2004; March &
Storey 2008), rigorous and relevant BI-related research using
management science (modeling, optimization), information
economics, and organizational and behavioral methodologies
(case studies, surveys) was also welcomed.  A total of 62
manuscripts was received by October 2010.  In the following
20 months, six of the manuscripts went through three or four
review rounds and were then accepted for this issue.  

The six papers address various aspects of the BI&A research
framework presented in this introduction paper (see Table 7).
All six papers are based on BI&A 1.0, with three also based
on BI&A 2.0.  The first three papers by Chau and Xu, Park et
al., and Lau et al. focus on BI&A 2.0 with applications on e-
commerce and market intelligence using text, web, and net-
work analytics.  In the next two papers, both Hu et al. and
Abbasi et al. work in the category of BI&A 1.0 with a focus
on  security,  but  Hu  et  al.  use  network  analytics  whereas
Abbasi et al. emphasize security analysis and data analytics. 
Finally, Sahoo et al. also work in BI&A 1.0, with direct appli-
cation to e-commerce and market intelligence using web and
data analytics.

In “Business Intelligence in Blogs:  Understanding Consumer
Interactions and Communities,” Michael Chau and Jennifer
Xu recognized the potential “gold mine” of blog content for
business  intelligence  and  developed  a  framework  for
gathering business intelligence by automatically collecting
and  analyzing  blog  content  and  bloggers’  interaction  net-
works.    A  system  developed  using  this  framework  was
applied to two case studies, which revealed novel patterns in
blogger interactions and communities.

Sung-Hyuk Park, Soon-Young Huh, Wonseok Oh, and Sang
Pil Han in their paper, “A Social Network-Based Inference
Model for Validating Customer Profile Data,” argue that busi-
ness intelligence systems are of limited value when they deal
with inaccurate and unreliable data.  The authors proposed a
social network-driven inference framework to determine the
accuracy  and  reliability  of  self-reported  customer  profiles.
The  framework  utilized  the  individuals’  social  circles  and

1184

MIS Quarterly Vol. 36 No. 4/December 2012

communication patterns within their circles.  To construct the
specific  inference  and  validation  model,  a  combination  of
methods  was  used,  including  query  processing,  statistical
inference, social network analysis, and user profiling.  The
authors analyzed over 20 million actual mobile call trans-
actions  and  their  proposed  social  network-based  inference
model consistently outperformed the alternative approaches.

In “Web 2.0 Environmental Scanning and Adaptive Decision
Support for Business Mergers and Acquisitions,” Raymond
Lau, Stephen Liao, K. F. Wong, and Dickson Chiu analyzed
company mergers and acquisitions (M&A).  Online environ-
mental scanning with Web 2.0 provides top executives with
opportunities to tap into collective web intelligence to develop
better insights about the socio-cultural and political-economic
factors that cross-border M&As face.  Grounded on Porter’s
five  forces  model,  this  research  designed  a  due  diligence
scorecard model that leverages collective web intelligence to
enhance M&A decision making.  The authors also developed
an adaptive business intelligence (BI) 2.0 system, which they
applied to Chinese companies’ cross-border M&A activities.

In their paper, “Network-Based Modeling and Analysis of
Systemic  Risk  in  Banking  Systems,”  Daning  Hu,  J.  Leon
Zhao, Zhimin Hua, and Michael Wong analyzed systemic risk
in banking systems by treating banks as a network linked with
financial relationships, leading to a network approach to risk
management (NARM).  The authors used NARM to analyze
systemic risk attributed to each individual bank via simulation
based on real-world data from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.  NARM  offered  a  new  means  by  which  con-
tagious bank failures could be predicted and capital injection
priorities at the individual bank level could be determined in
the wake of a financial crisis.  A simulation study showed
that, under significant market shocks, the interbank payment
links  became  more  influential  than  the  correlated  bank
portfolio links in determining an individual bank’s survival.

Ahmed Abbasi, Conan Albrecht, Anthony Vance, and James
Hansen in their paper, “MetaFraud:  A Meta-Learning Frame-
work  for  Detecting  Financial  Fraud,”  employed  a  design
science  approach  to  develop  MetaFraud,  a  meta-learning
framework for enhanced financial fraud detection.  A series
of experiments was conducted on thousands of legitimate and
fraudulent firms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the frame-
work over existing benchmark methods.  The research results
have  implications  for  compliance  officers,  investors,  audit
firms, and regulators.

The paper by Nachiketa Sahoo, Param Vir Singh, and Tridas
Mukhopadhyay, “A Hidden Markov Model for Collaborative
Filtering,”  reports  on  the  analysis  of  making  personalized
recommendations when user preferences are changing.  The

authors proposed a hidden Markov model based on collabo-

there is an advantage to using the proposed algorithm over
existing ones.

Summary and Conclusions

Through BI&A 1.0 initiatives, businesses and organizations
from  all  sectors  began  to  gain  critical  insights  from  the
structured data collected through various enterprise systems
and analyzed by commercial relational database management
systems.  Over the past several years, web intelligence, web
analytics, web 2.0, and the ability to mine unstructured user-
generated contents have ushered in a new and exciting era of
BI&A 2.0 research, leading to unprecedented intelligence on
consumer  opinion,  customer  needs,  and  recognizing  new
business opportunities.  Now, in this era of Big Data, even

while BI&A 2.0 is still maturing, we find ourselves poised at
the brink of BI&A 3.0, with all the attendant uncertainty that
new and potentially revolutionary technologies bring.

This MIS Quarterly Special Issue on Business Intelligence
Research  is  intended  to  serve,  in  part,  as  a  platform  and
conversation guide for examining how the IS discipline can
better serve the needs of business decision makers in light of
maturing and emerging BI&A technologies, ubiquitous Big
Data, and the predicted shortages of data-savvy managers and
of business professionals with deep analytical skills.  How
can academic IS programs continue to meet the needs of their
traditional  students,  while  also  reaching  the  working  IT
professional in need of new analytical skills?  A new vision
for IS may be needed to address this and other questions.

By  highlighting  several  applications  such  as  e-commerce,
market intelligence, e-government, healthcare, and security,
and  by  mapping  important  facets  of  the  current  BI&A
knowledge landscape, we hope to contribute to future sources
of  knowledge  and  to  augment  current  discussions  on  the
importance of (relevant) academic research.

Chen et al./Introduction:  Business Intelligence Research

Finally, the six papers chosen for this special issue are them-
selves a microcosm of the current state of BI&A research. 
These “best of the best” research papers showcase how high-
quality academic research can address real-world problems
and contribute solutions that are relevant and long lasting—
exactly the challenge that our discipline continues to face.
