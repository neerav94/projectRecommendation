Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study.

(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders.

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders.

values, such as equality and fairness.

papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss

drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also

It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to

corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.

While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders.

values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling

of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop

2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue.

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.

methodological framework for Big Data

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of

tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of

Tweeting the Olympics: Towards a 
methodological framework for Big Data 
analysis of audience engagement during global

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation. 

 

Page 441

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of

these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.

codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of

                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.

codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or

blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

methodological framework for Big Data

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.

codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services.

The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.

thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate?

approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study.

the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.

Tweeting the Olympics: Towards a 
methodological framework for Big Data

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443

                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of

                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.

codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter 

1.3  BBC Russian

Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

Tweeting the Olympics: Towards a 
methodological framework for Big Data

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g. 

 

 

Page 445

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method 

 

Page 446

The datasets for BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian were initially based on the

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in 

In comparison to the other Language Services, the sample of events selected for our

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This 

It is important to note that domestic, UK-based BBC Twitter accounts feature heavily 

 
the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter

Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443

                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

tweets for this account. This allows the user to collect tweets retrospectively.  
 
five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of

                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.

codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in 

In comparison to the other Language Services, the sample of events selected for our

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter 

1.3  BBC Russian

Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

                                        May 2015 

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

During the Olympics, Nobat-e Shoma featured three dedicated 30-minute 

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Tweeting the Olympics: Towards a 
methodological framework for Big Data 
analysis of audience engagement during global 
media events

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance

knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443

                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

The datasets for BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian were initially based on the

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

                                        May 2015 

 
BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter 

1.3  BBC Russian

facilitating engagement, our project also sought to explore the perception of Britain 
amongst Russian-speaking Twitter users.  
 
Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency:

affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.

websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social

conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g. 

 

 

Page 445

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method 

 

Page 446

The datasets for BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian were initially based on the

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in 

In comparison to the other Language Services, the sample of events selected for our

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This 

It is important to note that domestic, UK-based BBC Twitter accounts feature heavily 

 
the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter

Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.

international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation

Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be

opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter 

1.3  BBC Russian

facilitating engagement, our project also sought to explore the perception of Britain 
amongst Russian-speaking Twitter users.  
 
Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

                                        May 2015 

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.

international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing.

international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking

important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in 

In comparison to the other Language Services, the sample of events selected for our

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This 

It is important to note that domestic, UK-based BBC Twitter accounts feature heavily 

 
the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter 

1.3  BBC Russian

Russian. While the BBC were interested in how effective the Twitter Module was in 
facilitating engagement, our project also sought to explore the perception of Britain 
amongst Russian-speaking Twitter users.  
 
Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

                                        May 2015 

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers

selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.

these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

Fourthly, our comparison between different Language Services of the BBC World 

 
searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.

international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing. 
 
research design, we feel our project provides significant empirical findings on how 
international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking 
multi-language research. Comparative perspectives of social media use are increasingly 
important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our 
research reflects on the similarities and differences in audience behavior on Twitter from 
around the globe. 
 
time global events. In doing so we see our research design complementing the qualitative 
(e.g. Chadwick 2011), quantitative (e.g. Vaccari et al. 2015) and computational (e.g. Freelon 
and Karpf 2015) approaches used to analyse other events on Twitter in real-time (see 
Jungherr 2014). 
 
importance of mixed methods in Twitter research. In this study we attempted to combine 
both qualitative methods and computational traditions in ways that draw on their 
respective strengths. Computational tools help discover the more salient or un-typical 
content, while qualitative methods make sense of their meaning. Undoubtedly this 
collaboration brought challenges given the epistemological and ontological differences 
between computer science and social science, but it was in these exchanges where we

Finally, the ethical implications of Twitter research brought challenges. The 

 
found real value, as researchers learnt from one another. This and the other two 
methodological papers in this special section (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue; Willis, 
Fisher and Lvov, this issue), are indicative of this interdisciplinary exchange between social 
and computer scientists. Given the formative stages of Twitter research and the unique 
affordances required for both access to tweets and analysis of their content and the 
international social and communications networks forged, it is imperative researches 
embrace inter-disciplinarity. The methodological framework designed for this study was 
recreated and developed in the study on the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in this special 
issue (Hutchings et al., this issue). It is also being used in further projects – testimony to the 
social life of methods approach not just in academia.  
 
questions surrounding the ethics of online data collection have been written about at great 
length (boyd and Crawford, 2012). However, the variety of standards and norms across 
different disciplines about how to use and cite tweets indicates that we have yet to reach 
definitive conclusions as to what constitutes best practice. For some, informed consent is 
sacrosanct and therefore no information that directly identifies an individual Twitter user 
should be used within research outputs. For others, especially those coming from a 
qualitative tradition, it is often necessary to refer to specific tweets as an illustration of a 
case, context, or culture. In doing so, even if no user information is provided, a simple 
search on Twitter using this text will still identify the user responsible.

From a purely legal standpoint, the privacy policy for Twitter clearly states the risks

delivered  via  SMS  and  our  APIs  to  our  partners  and  other  third  parties, 
including  search  engines,  developers,  and  publishers  that  integrate  Twitter 
content  into  their  services,  and  institutions  such  as  universities  and  public 
health  agencies  that  analyze  the  information  for  trends  and  insights.  When 
you  share  information  or  content  like  photos,  videos,  and  links  via  the 
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public (Twitter 
2015). 

 
However, taking this privacy policy at face value is problematic, as ‘just because content is 
publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone’ (boyd 
and Crawford 2012:672). Given that much of the advice provided by professional 
associations is either unclear or contradictory, we, as researchers, have a responsibility to 
consider the potential privacy risks to subjects. As such, the authors of each paper in this 
special issue were given the option to choose how they wished to reference the data 
collected from Twitter. For some, this meant anonymising tweets to protect the anonymity 
of individual Twitter users in the highly politically sensitive Persian social media sphere (Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). The authors of the Russian article (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on

values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443

                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter

Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

During the Olympics, Nobat-e Shoma featured three dedicated 30-minute 

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

Accessing the data required for research purposes is difficult enough (see boyd and 

 
 
evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

Fourthly, our comparison between different Language Services of the BBC World 

 
searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.

international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

where there are some points of reference but no single, obvious point of reference or

this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing. 
 
research design, we feel our project provides significant empirical findings on how 
international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking 
multi-language research. Comparative perspectives of social media use are increasingly 
important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our 
research reflects on the similarities and differences in audience behavior on Twitter from 
around the globe. 
 
time global events. In doing so we see our research design complementing the qualitative 
(e.g. Chadwick 2011), quantitative (e.g. Vaccari et al. 2015) and computational (e.g. Freelon 
and Karpf 2015) approaches used to analyse other events on Twitter in real-time (see 
Jungherr 2014). 
 
importance of mixed methods in Twitter research. In this study we attempted to combine 
both qualitative methods and computational traditions in ways that draw on their 
respective strengths. Computational tools help discover the more salient or un-typical 
content, while qualitative methods make sense of their meaning. Undoubtedly this 
collaboration brought challenges given the epistemological and ontological differences

Finally, the ethical implications of Twitter research brought challenges. The 

 
found real value, as researchers learnt from one another. This and the other two 
methodological papers in this special section (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue; Willis, 
Fisher and Lvov, this issue), are indicative of this interdisciplinary exchange between social 
and computer scientists. Given the formative stages of Twitter research and the unique 
affordances required for both access to tweets and analysis of their content and the 
international social and communications networks forged, it is imperative researches 
embrace inter-disciplinarity. The methodological framework designed for this study was 
recreated and developed in the study on the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in this special 
issue (Hutchings et al., this issue). It is also being used in further projects – testimony to the 
social life of methods approach not just in academia.  
 
questions surrounding the ethics of online data collection have been written about at great 
length (boyd and Crawford, 2012). However, the variety of standards and norms across 
different disciplines about how to use and cite tweets indicates that we have yet to reach 
definitive conclusions as to what constitutes best practice. For some, informed consent is 
sacrosanct and therefore no information that directly identifies an individual Twitter user 
should be used within research outputs. For others, especially those coming from a 
qualitative tradition, it is often necessary to refer to specific tweets as an illustration of a 
case, context, or culture. In doing so, even if no user information is provided, a simple 
search on Twitter using this text will still identify the user responsible. 
 
posed to the user when sharing tweets publicly: 
 

From a purely legal standpoint, the privacy policy for Twitter clearly states the risks 

Your  public  user  profile  information  and  public  Tweets  are  immediately 
delivered  via  SMS  and  our  APIs  to  our  partners  and  other  third  parties, 
including  search  engines,  developers,  and  publishers  that  integrate  Twitter 
content  into  their  services,  and  institutions  such  as  universities  and  public 
health  agencies  that  analyze  the  information  for  trends  and  insights.  When 
you  share  information  or  content  like  photos,  videos,  and  links  via  the 
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public (Twitter 
2015). 

 
However, taking this privacy policy at face value is problematic, as ‘just because content is 
publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone’ (boyd 
and Crawford 2012:672). Given that much of the advice provided by professional 
associations is either unclear or contradictory, we, as researchers, have a responsibility to 
consider the potential privacy risks to subjects. As such, the authors of each paper in this 
special issue were given the option to choose how they wished to reference the data 
collected from Twitter. For some, this meant anonymising tweets to protect the anonymity 
of individual Twitter users in the highly politically sensitive Persian social media sphere (Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). The authors of the Russian article (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this

were already pseudonyms. Moreover, it was considered that the Russian authorities 
constantly monitor social networks using far more sophisticated methods than those 
available to us as academic researchers. Also given the time elapsed between the tweet and 
this publication it was deemed highly unlikely the Russian authorities would pay any 
attention to an academic English-language publication that has cited a few tweets about the 
London Olympics.

issues that require different kinds of solutions. What is also certain is that Twitter will also 
continue to transgress public and private boundaries in ways that are unforeseeable.

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443

                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

The datasets for BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian were initially based on the

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter

Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

During the Olympics, Nobat-e Shoma featured three dedicated 30-minute 

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

Accessing the data required for research purposes is difficult enough (see boyd and 

 
 
evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

Fourthly, our comparison between different Language Services of the BBC World 

 
searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.  
 
within the territories of nation-states, may obfuscate the vast differences in internet 
adoption and social media use across the world. Different countries often have distinctive 
political cultures and media systems. Thought is needed about how future research should

harness social media users’ conversations. A comparison between other comparable 
international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

expectations about what is say-able or should be said. It may be that ambiguous objects, 
where there are some points of reference but no single, obvious point of reference or 
precedent, could result in differentiated and more ambivalent or even creative perspectives. 
 
this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing. 
 
research design, we feel our project provides significant empirical findings on how 
international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking 
multi-language research. Comparative perspectives of social media use are increasingly 
important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our 
research reflects on the similarities and differences in audience behavior on Twitter from 
around the globe. 
 
time global events. In doing so we see our research design complementing the qualitative 
(e.g. Chadwick 2011), quantitative (e.g. Vaccari et al. 2015) and computational (e.g. Freelon 
and Karpf 2015) approaches used to analyse other events on Twitter in real-time (see 
Jungherr 2014). 
 
importance of mixed methods in Twitter research. In this study we attempted to combine 
both qualitative methods and computational traditions in ways that draw on their 
respective strengths. Computational tools help discover the more salient or un-typical 
content, while qualitative methods make sense of their meaning. Undoubtedly this 
collaboration brought challenges given the epistemological and ontological differences 
between computer science and social science, but it was in these exchanges where we

Finally, the ethical implications of Twitter research brought challenges. The 

 
found real value, as researchers learnt from one another. This and the other two 
methodological papers in this special section (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue; Willis, 
Fisher and Lvov, this issue), are indicative of this interdisciplinary exchange between social 
and computer scientists. Given the formative stages of Twitter research and the unique 
affordances required for both access to tweets and analysis of their content and the 
international social and communications networks forged, it is imperative researches 
embrace inter-disciplinarity. The methodological framework designed for this study was 
recreated and developed in the study on the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in this special 
issue (Hutchings et al., this issue). It is also being used in further projects – testimony to the 
social life of methods approach not just in academia.  
 
questions surrounding the ethics of online data collection have been written about at great 
length (boyd and Crawford, 2012). However, the variety of standards and norms across 
different disciplines about how to use and cite tweets indicates that we have yet to reach 
definitive conclusions as to what constitutes best practice. For some, informed consent is 
sacrosanct and therefore no information that directly identifies an individual Twitter user 
should be used within research outputs. For others, especially those coming from a 
qualitative tradition, it is often necessary to refer to specific tweets as an illustration of a 
case, context, or culture. In doing so, even if no user information is provided, a simple 
search on Twitter using this text will still identify the user responsible. 
 
posed to the user when sharing tweets publicly: 
 

From a purely legal standpoint, the privacy policy for Twitter clearly states the risks 

Your  public  user  profile  information  and  public  Tweets  are  immediately 
delivered  via  SMS  and  our  APIs  to  our  partners  and  other  third  parties, 
including  search  engines,  developers,  and  publishers  that  integrate  Twitter 
content  into  their  services,  and  institutions  such  as  universities  and  public 
health  agencies  that  analyze  the  information  for  trends  and  insights.  When 
you  share  information  or  content  like  photos,  videos,  and  links  via  the 
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public (Twitter 
2015). 

 
However, taking this privacy policy at face value is problematic, as ‘just because content is 
publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone’ (boyd 
and Crawford 2012:672). Given that much of the advice provided by professional 
associations is either unclear or contradictory, we, as researchers, have a responsibility to 
consider the potential privacy risks to subjects. As such, the authors of each paper in this 
special issue were given the option to choose how they wished to reference the data 
collected from Twitter. For some, this meant anonymising tweets to protect the anonymity 
of individual Twitter users in the highly politically sensitive Persian social media sphere (Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). The authors of the Russian article (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this

issue) in contrast used Twitter names many of which, in the case of the Russian corpus, 
were already pseudonyms. Moreover, it was considered that the Russian authorities 
constantly monitor social networks using far more sophisticated methods than those 
available to us as academic researchers. Also given the time elapsed between the tweet and 
this publication it was deemed highly unlikely the Russian authorities would pay any 
attention to an academic English-language publication that has cited a few tweets about the 
London Olympics.  
 
future given that different political and linguistic contexts raise different kinds of ethical 
issues that require different kinds of solutions. What is also certain is that Twitter will also 
continue to transgress public and private boundaries in ways that are unforeseeable.

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

The datasets for BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian were initially based on the 

 
for the @BBCPersian account. Instead we used the RESTful Twitter API to retrieve the 
tweets for this account. This allows the user to collect tweets retrospectively.  
 
five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of

tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes.

in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of

these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.

codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or

blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in 

In comparison to the other Language Services, the sample of events selected for our

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter 

1.3  BBC Russian

facilitating engagement, our project also sought to explore the perception of Britain 
amongst Russian-speaking Twitter users.  
 
Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the 

 

Page 454

                                        May 2015 

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

During the Olympics, Nobat-e Shoma featured three dedicated 30-minute 

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

Accessing the data required for research purposes is difficult enough (see boyd and 

 
 
evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

Fourthly, our comparison between different Language Services of the BBC World 

 
searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.  
 
within the territories of nation-states, may obfuscate the vast differences in internet 
adoption and social media use across the world. Different countries often have distinctive 
political cultures and media systems. Thought is needed about how future research should 
address, accommodate and explore these political and cultural differences. 
 
harness social media users’ conversations. A comparison between other comparable 
international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

where there are some points of reference but no single, obvious point of reference or 
precedent, could result in differentiated and more ambivalent or even creative perspectives. 
 
this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing. 
 
research design, we feel our project provides significant empirical findings on how 
international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking 
multi-language research. Comparative perspectives of social media use are increasingly 
important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our 
research reflects on the similarities and differences in audience behavior on Twitter from 
around the globe. 
 
time global events. In doing so we see our research design complementing the qualitative 
(e.g. Chadwick 2011), quantitative (e.g. Vaccari et al. 2015) and computational (e.g. Freelon 
and Karpf 2015) approaches used to analyse other events on Twitter in real-time (see 
Jungherr 2014). 
 
importance of mixed methods in Twitter research. In this study we attempted to combine 
both qualitative methods and computational traditions in ways that draw on their 
respective strengths. Computational tools help discover the more salient or un-typical 
content, while qualitative methods make sense of their meaning. Undoubtedly this 
collaboration brought challenges given the epistemological and ontological differences 
between computer science and social science, but it was in these exchanges where we

Finally, the ethical implications of Twitter research brought challenges. The 

 
found real value, as researchers learnt from one another. This and the other two 
methodological papers in this special section (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue; Willis, 
Fisher and Lvov, this issue), are indicative of this interdisciplinary exchange between social 
and computer scientists. Given the formative stages of Twitter research and the unique 
affordances required for both access to tweets and analysis of their content and the 
international social and communications networks forged, it is imperative researches 
embrace inter-disciplinarity. The methodological framework designed for this study was 
recreated and developed in the study on the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in this special 
issue (Hutchings et al., this issue). It is also being used in further projects – testimony to the 
social life of methods approach not just in academia.  
 
questions surrounding the ethics of online data collection have been written about at great 
length (boyd and Crawford, 2012). However, the variety of standards and norms across 
different disciplines about how to use and cite tweets indicates that we have yet to reach 
definitive conclusions as to what constitutes best practice. For some, informed consent is 
sacrosanct and therefore no information that directly identifies an individual Twitter user 
should be used within research outputs. For others, especially those coming from a 
qualitative tradition, it is often necessary to refer to specific tweets as an illustration of a 
case, context, or culture. In doing so, even if no user information is provided, a simple 
search on Twitter using this text will still identify the user responsible. 
 
posed to the user when sharing tweets publicly: 
 

From a purely legal standpoint, the privacy policy for Twitter clearly states the risks 

Your  public  user  profile  information  and  public  Tweets  are  immediately 
delivered  via  SMS  and  our  APIs  to  our  partners  and  other  third  parties, 
including  search  engines,  developers,  and  publishers  that  integrate  Twitter 
content  into  their  services,  and  institutions  such  as  universities  and  public 
health  agencies  that  analyze  the  information  for  trends  and  insights.  When 
you  share  information  or  content  like  photos,  videos,  and  links  via  the 
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public (Twitter 
2015). 

 
However, taking this privacy policy at face value is problematic, as ‘just because content is 
publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone’ (boyd 
and Crawford 2012:672). Given that much of the advice provided by professional 
associations is either unclear or contradictory, we, as researchers, have a responsibility to 
consider the potential privacy risks to subjects. As such, the authors of each paper in this 
special issue were given the option to choose how they wished to reference the data 
collected from Twitter. For some, this meant anonymising tweets to protect the anonymity 
of individual Twitter users in the highly politically sensitive Persian social media sphere (Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). The authors of the Russian article (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this

Such ethical issues are likely to continue to challenge researchers for the foreseeable 

 
issue) in contrast used Twitter names many of which, in the case of the Russian corpus, 
were already pseudonyms. Moreover, it was considered that the Russian authorities 
constantly monitor social networks using far more sophisticated methods than those 
available to us as academic researchers. Also given the time elapsed between the tweet and 
this publication it was deemed highly unlikely the Russian authorities would pay any 
attention to an academic English-language publication that has cited a few tweets about the 
London Olympics.

issues that require different kinds of solutions. What is also certain is that Twitter will also 
continue to transgress public and private boundaries in ways that are unforeseeable.

Tweeting the Olympics: Towards a 
methodological framework for Big Data 
analysis of audience engagement during global 
media events

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

judicious assessment of the framework we created and used, and suggests new fruitful lines 
of enquiry.

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

for the @BBCPersian account. Instead we used the RESTful Twitter API to retrieve the 
tweets for this account. This allows the user to collect tweets retrospectively.  
 
five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in 

In comparison to the other Language Services, the sample of events selected for our

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This 

It is important to note that domestic, UK-based BBC Twitter accounts feature heavily 

 
the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter 

1.3  BBC Russian

Russian. While the BBC were interested in how effective the Twitter Module was in 
facilitating engagement, our project also sought to explore the perception of Britain 
amongst Russian-speaking Twitter users.  
 
Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

                                        May 2015 

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

Accessing the data required for research purposes is difficult enough (see boyd and 

 
 
evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

tweets (see Jungherr 2014). Throughout the project we systematically used keyword

Thirdly, using keywords to refine large collections of social data can compromise the

Fourthly, our comparison between different Language Services of the BBC World 

 
searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.  
 
within the territories of nation-states, may obfuscate the vast differences in internet 
adoption and social media use across the world. Different countries often have distinctive 
political cultures and media systems. Thought is needed about how future research should 
address, accommodate and explore these political and cultural differences. 
 
harness social media users’ conversations. A comparison between other comparable 
international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

obvious moments generate predictable conversations as users follow ‘scripts’ or 
expectations about what is say-able or should be said. It may be that ambiguous objects, 
where there are some points of reference but no single, obvious point of reference or 
precedent, could result in differentiated and more ambivalent or even creative perspectives. 
 
this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing. 
 
research design, we feel our project provides significant empirical findings on how 
international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking 
multi-language research. Comparative perspectives of social media use are increasingly 
important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our 
research reflects on the similarities and differences in audience behavior on Twitter from 
around the globe. 
 
time global events. In doing so we see our research design complementing the qualitative 
(e.g. Chadwick 2011), quantitative (e.g. Vaccari et al. 2015) and computational (e.g. Freelon 
and Karpf 2015) approaches used to analyse other events on Twitter in real-time (see 
Jungherr 2014). 
 
importance of mixed methods in Twitter research. In this study we attempted to combine 
both qualitative methods and computational traditions in ways that draw on their 
respective strengths. Computational tools help discover the more salient or un-typical 
content, while qualitative methods make sense of their meaning. Undoubtedly this 
collaboration brought challenges given the epistemological and ontological differences 
between computer science and social science, but it was in these exchanges where we

Finally, the ethical implications of Twitter research brought challenges. The 

 
found real value, as researchers learnt from one another. This and the other two 
methodological papers in this special section (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue; Willis, 
Fisher and Lvov, this issue), are indicative of this interdisciplinary exchange between social 
and computer scientists. Given the formative stages of Twitter research and the unique 
affordances required for both access to tweets and analysis of their content and the 
international social and communications networks forged, it is imperative researches 
embrace inter-disciplinarity. The methodological framework designed for this study was 
recreated and developed in the study on the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in this special 
issue (Hutchings et al., this issue). It is also being used in further projects – testimony to the 
social life of methods approach not just in academia.  
 
questions surrounding the ethics of online data collection have been written about at great 
length (boyd and Crawford, 2012). However, the variety of standards and norms across 
different disciplines about how to use and cite tweets indicates that we have yet to reach 
definitive conclusions as to what constitutes best practice. For some, informed consent is 
sacrosanct and therefore no information that directly identifies an individual Twitter user 
should be used within research outputs. For others, especially those coming from a 
qualitative tradition, it is often necessary to refer to specific tweets as an illustration of a 
case, context, or culture. In doing so, even if no user information is provided, a simple 
search on Twitter using this text will still identify the user responsible. 
 
posed to the user when sharing tweets publicly: 
 

From a purely legal standpoint, the privacy policy for Twitter clearly states the risks 

Your  public  user  profile  information  and  public  Tweets  are  immediately 
delivered  via  SMS  and  our  APIs  to  our  partners  and  other  third  parties, 
including  search  engines,  developers,  and  publishers  that  integrate  Twitter 
content  into  their  services,  and  institutions  such  as  universities  and  public 
health  agencies  that  analyze  the  information  for  trends  and  insights.  When 
you  share  information  or  content  like  photos,  videos,  and  links  via  the 
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public (Twitter 
2015). 

 
However, taking this privacy policy at face value is problematic, as ‘just because content is 
publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone’ (boyd 
and Crawford 2012:672). Given that much of the advice provided by professional 
associations is either unclear or contradictory, we, as researchers, have a responsibility to 
consider the potential privacy risks to subjects. As such, the authors of each paper in this 
special issue were given the option to choose how they wished to reference the data 
collected from Twitter. For some, this meant anonymising tweets to protect the anonymity 
of individual Twitter users in the highly politically sensitive Persian social media sphere (Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). The authors of the Russian article (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this

Such ethical issues are likely to continue to challenge researchers for the foreseeable 

 
issue) in contrast used Twitter names many of which, in the case of the Russian corpus, 
were already pseudonyms. Moreover, it was considered that the Russian authorities 
constantly monitor social networks using far more sophisticated methods than those 
available to us as academic researchers. Also given the time elapsed between the tweet and 
this publication it was deemed highly unlikely the Russian authorities would pay any 
attention to an academic English-language publication that has cited a few tweets about the 
London Olympics.  
 
future given that different political and linguistic contexts raise different kinds of ethical 
issues that require different kinds of solutions. What is also certain is that Twitter will also 
continue to transgress public and private boundaries in ways that are unforeseeable.

Tweeting the Olympics: Towards a 
methodological framework for Big Data 
analysis of audience engagement during global 
media events

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

judicious assessment of the framework we created and used, and suggests new fruitful lines 
of enquiry.

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

The datasets for BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian were initially based on the 

 
for the @BBCPersian account. Instead we used the RESTful Twitter API to retrieve the 
tweets for this account. This allows the user to collect tweets retrospectively.  
 
five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of

tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of

these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.

codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in 

In comparison to the other Language Services, the sample of events selected for our

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter 

1.3  BBC Russian

Russian. While the BBC were interested in how effective the Twitter Module was in 
facilitating engagement, our project also sought to explore the perception of Britain 
amongst Russian-speaking Twitter users.  
 
Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

                                        May 2015 

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.  
 
2.  Conclusion: Limitations, Opportunities and Suggestions for Future 

During the Olympics, Nobat-e Shoma featured three dedicated 30-minute 

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

Accessing the data required for research purposes is difficult enough (see boyd and 

 
 
evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics. 
 
data collected because the sampling frame may systematically exclude other relevant 
tweets (see Jungherr 2014). Throughout the project we systematically used keyword

Fourthly, our comparison between different Language Services of the BBC World 

 
searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.

international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

obvious moments generate predictable conversations as users follow ‘scripts’ or 
expectations about what is say-able or should be said. It may be that ambiguous objects, 
where there are some points of reference but no single, obvious point of reference or 
precedent, could result in differentiated and more ambivalent or even creative perspectives. 
 
this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing. 
 
research design, we feel our project provides significant empirical findings on how 
international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking 
multi-language research. Comparative perspectives of social media use are increasingly 
important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our 
research reflects on the similarities and differences in audience behavior on Twitter from 
around the globe. 
 
time global events. In doing so we see our research design complementing the qualitative 
(e.g. Chadwick 2011), quantitative (e.g. Vaccari et al. 2015) and computational (e.g. Freelon 
and Karpf 2015) approaches used to analyse other events on Twitter in real-time (see 
Jungherr 2014). 
 
importance of mixed methods in Twitter research. In this study we attempted to combine 
both qualitative methods and computational traditions in ways that draw on their 
respective strengths. Computational tools help discover the more salient or un-typical 
content, while qualitative methods make sense of their meaning. Undoubtedly this 
collaboration brought challenges given the epistemological and ontological differences 
between computer science and social science, but it was in these exchanges where we

Finally, the ethical implications of Twitter research brought challenges. The 

 
found real value, as researchers learnt from one another. This and the other two 
methodological papers in this special section (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue; Willis, 
Fisher and Lvov, this issue), are indicative of this interdisciplinary exchange between social 
and computer scientists. Given the formative stages of Twitter research and the unique 
affordances required for both access to tweets and analysis of their content and the 
international social and communications networks forged, it is imperative researches 
embrace inter-disciplinarity. The methodological framework designed for this study was 
recreated and developed in the study on the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in this special 
issue (Hutchings et al., this issue). It is also being used in further projects – testimony to the 
social life of methods approach not just in academia.  
 
questions surrounding the ethics of online data collection have been written about at great 
length (boyd and Crawford, 2012). However, the variety of standards and norms across 
different disciplines about how to use and cite tweets indicates that we have yet to reach 
definitive conclusions as to what constitutes best practice. For some, informed consent is 
sacrosanct and therefore no information that directly identifies an individual Twitter user 
should be used within research outputs. For others, especially those coming from a 
qualitative tradition, it is often necessary to refer to specific tweets as an illustration of a 
case, context, or culture. In doing so, even if no user information is provided, a simple 
search on Twitter using this text will still identify the user responsible. 
 
posed to the user when sharing tweets publicly: 
 

From a purely legal standpoint, the privacy policy for Twitter clearly states the risks 

Your  public  user  profile  information  and  public  Tweets  are  immediately 
delivered  via  SMS  and  our  APIs  to  our  partners  and  other  third  parties, 
including  search  engines,  developers,  and  publishers  that  integrate  Twitter 
content  into  their  services,  and  institutions  such  as  universities  and  public 
health  agencies  that  analyze  the  information  for  trends  and  insights.  When 
you  share  information  or  content  like  photos,  videos,  and  links  via  the 
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public (Twitter 
2015). 

 
However, taking this privacy policy at face value is problematic, as ‘just because content is 
publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone’ (boyd 
and Crawford 2012:672). Given that much of the advice provided by professional 
associations is either unclear or contradictory, we, as researchers, have a responsibility to 
consider the potential privacy risks to subjects. As such, the authors of each paper in this 
special issue were given the option to choose how they wished to reference the data 
collected from Twitter. For some, this meant anonymising tweets to protect the anonymity 
of individual Twitter users in the highly politically sensitive Persian social media sphere (Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). The authors of the Russian article (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this

Such ethical issues are likely to continue to challenge researchers for the foreseeable 

 
issue) in contrast used Twitter names many of which, in the case of the Russian corpus, 
were already pseudonyms. Moreover, it was considered that the Russian authorities 
constantly monitor social networks using far more sophisticated methods than those 
available to us as academic researchers. Also given the time elapsed between the tweet and 
this publication it was deemed highly unlikely the Russian authorities would pay any 
attention to an academic English-language publication that has cited a few tweets about the 
London Olympics.  
 
future given that different political and linguistic contexts raise different kinds of ethical 
issues that require different kinds of solutions. What is also certain is that Twitter will also 
continue to transgress public and private boundaries in ways that are unforeseeable.

Tweeting the Olympics: Towards a 
methodological framework for Big Data 
analysis of audience engagement during global 
media events

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate?

approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that 

 

Page 443 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter

Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

Fourthly, our comparison between different Language Services of the BBC World 

 
searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.  
 
within the territories of nation-states, may obfuscate the vast differences in internet 
adoption and social media use across the world. Different countries often have distinctive 
political cultures and media systems. Thought is needed about how future research should

harness social media users’ conversations. A comparison between other comparable 
international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

expectations about what is say-able or should be said. It may be that ambiguous objects, 
where there are some points of reference but no single, obvious point of reference or 
precedent, could result in differentiated and more ambivalent or even creative perspectives. 
 
this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing. 
 
research design, we feel our project provides significant empirical findings on how 
international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking 
multi-language research. Comparative perspectives of social media use are increasingly 
important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our 
research reflects on the similarities and differences in audience behavior on Twitter from 
around the globe. 
 
time global events. In doing so we see our research design complementing the qualitative 
(e.g. Chadwick 2011), quantitative (e.g. Vaccari et al. 2015) and computational (e.g. Freelon 
and Karpf 2015) approaches used to analyse other events on Twitter in real-time (see 
Jungherr 2014). 
 
importance of mixed methods in Twitter research. In this study we attempted to combine 
both qualitative methods and computational traditions in ways that draw on their 
respective strengths. Computational tools help discover the more salient or un-typical 
content, while qualitative methods make sense of their meaning. Undoubtedly this 
collaboration brought challenges given the epistemological and ontological differences 
between computer science and social science, but it was in these exchanges where we

Finally, the ethical implications of Twitter research brought challenges. The 

 
found real value, as researchers learnt from one another. This and the other two 
methodological papers in this special section (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue; Willis, 
Fisher and Lvov, this issue), are indicative of this interdisciplinary exchange between social 
and computer scientists. Given the formative stages of Twitter research and the unique 
affordances required for both access to tweets and analysis of their content and the 
international social and communications networks forged, it is imperative researches 
embrace inter-disciplinarity. The methodological framework designed for this study was 
recreated and developed in the study on the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in this special 
issue (Hutchings et al., this issue). It is also being used in further projects – testimony to the 
social life of methods approach not just in academia.  
 
questions surrounding the ethics of online data collection have been written about at great 
length (boyd and Crawford, 2012). However, the variety of standards and norms across 
different disciplines about how to use and cite tweets indicates that we have yet to reach 
definitive conclusions as to what constitutes best practice. For some, informed consent is 
sacrosanct and therefore no information that directly identifies an individual Twitter user 
should be used within research outputs. For others, especially those coming from a 
qualitative tradition, it is often necessary to refer to specific tweets as an illustration of a 
case, context, or culture. In doing so, even if no user information is provided, a simple 
search on Twitter using this text will still identify the user responsible. 
 
posed to the user when sharing tweets publicly: 
 

From a purely legal standpoint, the privacy policy for Twitter clearly states the risks 

Your  public  user  profile  information  and  public  Tweets  are  immediately 
delivered  via  SMS  and  our  APIs  to  our  partners  and  other  third  parties, 
including  search  engines,  developers,  and  publishers  that  integrate  Twitter 
content  into  their  services,  and  institutions  such  as  universities  and  public 
health  agencies  that  analyze  the  information  for  trends  and  insights.  When 
you  share  information  or  content  like  photos,  videos,  and  links  via  the 
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public (Twitter 
2015). 

 
However, taking this privacy policy at face value is problematic, as ‘just because content is 
publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone’ (boyd 
and Crawford 2012:672). Given that much of the advice provided by professional 
associations is either unclear or contradictory, we, as researchers, have a responsibility to 
consider the potential privacy risks to subjects. As such, the authors of each paper in this 
special issue were given the option to choose how they wished to reference the data 
collected from Twitter. For some, this meant anonymising tweets to protect the anonymity 
of individual Twitter users in the highly politically sensitive Persian social media sphere (Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). The authors of the Russian article (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this

were already pseudonyms. Moreover, it was considered that the Russian authorities 
constantly monitor social networks using far more sophisticated methods than those 
available to us as academic researchers. Also given the time elapsed between the tweet and 
this publication it was deemed highly unlikely the Russian authorities would pay any 
attention to an academic English-language publication that has cited a few tweets about the 
London Olympics.

issues that require different kinds of solutions. What is also certain is that Twitter will also 
continue to transgress public and private boundaries in ways that are unforeseeable.

Tweeting the Olympics: Towards a 
methodological framework for Big Data 
analysis of audience engagement during global 
media events

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

Audience research data, in particular, plays a very important role in shaping editorial

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This

the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter

turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to 

Following the approach used in the other Language Services, five events were

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.  
 
2.  Conclusion: Limitations, Opportunities and Suggestions for Future 

During the Olympics, Nobat-e Shoma featured three dedicated 30-minute 

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

Accessing the data required for research purposes is difficult enough (see boyd and 

 
 
evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

tweets (see Jungherr 2014). Throughout the project we systematically used keyword

Fourthly, our comparison between different Language Services of the BBC World 

 
searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.  
 
within the territories of nation-states, may obfuscate the vast differences in internet 
adoption and social media use across the world. Different countries often have distinctive 
political cultures and media systems. Thought is needed about how future research should 
address, accommodate and explore these political and cultural differences. 
 
harness social media users’ conversations. A comparison between other comparable 
international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

obvious moments generate predictable conversations as users follow ‘scripts’ or 
expectations about what is say-able or should be said. It may be that ambiguous objects, 
where there are some points of reference but no single, obvious point of reference or 
precedent, could result in differentiated and more ambivalent or even creative perspectives. 
 
this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing. 
 
research design, we feel our project provides significant empirical findings on how 
international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking 
multi-language research. Comparative perspectives of social media use are increasingly 
important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our 
research reflects on the similarities and differences in audience behavior on Twitter from 
around the globe. 
 
time global events. In doing so we see our research design complementing the qualitative 
(e.g. Chadwick 2011), quantitative (e.g. Vaccari et al. 2015) and computational (e.g. Freelon 
and Karpf 2015) approaches used to analyse other events on Twitter in real-time (see 
Jungherr 2014). 
 
importance of mixed methods in Twitter research. In this study we attempted to combine 
both qualitative methods and computational traditions in ways that draw on their 
respective strengths. Computational tools help discover the more salient or un-typical 
content, while qualitative methods make sense of their meaning. Undoubtedly this 
collaboration brought challenges given the epistemological and ontological differences 
between computer science and social science, but it was in these exchanges where we

Finally, the ethical implications of Twitter research brought challenges. The 

 
found real value, as researchers learnt from one another. This and the other two 
methodological papers in this special section (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue; Willis, 
Fisher and Lvov, this issue), are indicative of this interdisciplinary exchange between social 
and computer scientists. Given the formative stages of Twitter research and the unique 
affordances required for both access to tweets and analysis of their content and the 
international social and communications networks forged, it is imperative researches 
embrace inter-disciplinarity. The methodological framework designed for this study was 
recreated and developed in the study on the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in this special 
issue (Hutchings et al., this issue). It is also being used in further projects – testimony to the 
social life of methods approach not just in academia.  
 
questions surrounding the ethics of online data collection have been written about at great 
length (boyd and Crawford, 2012). However, the variety of standards and norms across 
different disciplines about how to use and cite tweets indicates that we have yet to reach 
definitive conclusions as to what constitutes best practice. For some, informed consent is 
sacrosanct and therefore no information that directly identifies an individual Twitter user 
should be used within research outputs. For others, especially those coming from a 
qualitative tradition, it is often necessary to refer to specific tweets as an illustration of a 
case, context, or culture. In doing so, even if no user information is provided, a simple 
search on Twitter using this text will still identify the user responsible. 
 
posed to the user when sharing tweets publicly: 
 

From a purely legal standpoint, the privacy policy for Twitter clearly states the risks 

Your  public  user  profile  information  and  public  Tweets  are  immediately 
delivered  via  SMS  and  our  APIs  to  our  partners  and  other  third  parties, 
including  search  engines,  developers,  and  publishers  that  integrate  Twitter 
content  into  their  services,  and  institutions  such  as  universities  and  public 
health  agencies  that  analyze  the  information  for  trends  and  insights.  When 
you  share  information  or  content  like  photos,  videos,  and  links  via  the 
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public (Twitter 
2015). 

 
However, taking this privacy policy at face value is problematic, as ‘just because content is 
publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone’ (boyd 
and Crawford 2012:672). Given that much of the advice provided by professional 
associations is either unclear or contradictory, we, as researchers, have a responsibility to 
consider the potential privacy risks to subjects. As such, the authors of each paper in this 
special issue were given the option to choose how they wished to reference the data 
collected from Twitter. For some, this meant anonymising tweets to protect the anonymity 
of individual Twitter users in the highly politically sensitive Persian social media sphere (Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). The authors of the Russian article (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this

Such ethical issues are likely to continue to challenge researchers for the foreseeable 

 
issue) in contrast used Twitter names many of which, in the case of the Russian corpus, 
were already pseudonyms. Moreover, it was considered that the Russian authorities 
constantly monitor social networks using far more sophisticated methods than those 
available to us as academic researchers. Also given the time elapsed between the tweet and 
this publication it was deemed highly unlikely the Russian authorities would pay any 
attention to an academic English-language publication that has cited a few tweets about the 
London Olympics.  
 
future given that different political and linguistic contexts raise different kinds of ethical 
issues that require different kinds of solutions. What is also certain is that Twitter will also 
continue to transgress public and private boundaries in ways that are unforeseeable.

Tweeting the Olympics: Towards a 
methodological framework for Big Data 
analysis of audience engagement during global 
media events

Abstract: 
This article explains the methodological framework created for the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ 
project represented in this Journal issue that can be used and adapted by other researchers 
in their studies of global media events. This project was a case study in the adoption of and 
adaptation to social media in a global news organisation. It examined the opportunities and 
challenges that were faced by the BBC World Service during the 2012 London Olympic 
Games in developing their Twitter strategy, and how audiences responded. The aim of the 
project was to assess whether and how the BBC World Service engaged audiences via 
Twitter and fostered intercultural dialogue (or, in the BBC’s terms, a ‘global conversation’). 
We focused on the uses of Twitter by four different Language Services provided by the BBC 
World Service: the BBC Arabic Service; BBC.com (the English Language Service targeted at 
overseas audiences); the BBC Persian Service; and the BBC Russian Service. We adopted a 
‘social life of methods’ approach that treats methods as active agents in institutional 
processes. We argue that social media research and methods, despite their rapid 
emergence and proliferation, are still at an early stage of development and should be 
treated as experimental. As we develop methodological designs for our research 
experiments, sharing our experiences of failure as well as of success is important to advance 
the field. For although some regard ‘big data’ as the new gold standard, promising forms of 
knowledge previously unattainable, it is wise to be cautious. There are risks as well benefits 
for academics working alongside corporate researchers. The paper offers an honest and

Introduction 
‘Tweeting the Olympics’ was a collaborative research project between the BBC World 
Service and the Open University (OU). It was part of a 5-year research partnership between 
the BBC and the OU’s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change.1 It brought together a 
distinctive and rather unusual set of research priorities. For the BBCWS, there were two 
objectives. The first was to understand how overseas audiences engaged with BBCWS via 
Twitter during a major global media event. The second was to understand what, if anything, 
was gained during the Games from the BBC’s Twitter Strategy. The BBC’s Twitter strategy 
involved the creation of a customisable feed that collects tweets in real-time from a range 
of Twitter users selected by the host organisation. The BBC referred to this as the Twitter 
Module. The Twitter Module had not been used extensively before so the BBC believed that 
London Games presented a real opportunity for them to increase their audience numbers 
and to engage them in cross-border dialogue via social media.  

The academic team partnered with the BBC’s Audience Research team in pursuit of 
the above goals. They were keen to involve academic partners to provide a sense of critical 
distance and independence in the evaluation of their Twitter strategy. The OU team also 
identified their own set of analytical and practical questions to ask of the Twitter data that 
was collected. We were interested in the following questions: how does the BBCWS define 
and measure engagement? What forms of engagement did the Twitter Module generate? 
To what extent did the BBCWS influence discussions around the Olympic Games on Twitter? 
Did social media allow users to shape news agendas? How did the BBCWS and their Twitter 
users/audiences negotiate the tensions between national and cosmopolitan sensibilities and 
identities?  
 
approach is based on the premise that methods are not socially and culturally neutral 
techniques and tools for gathering data but must be seen as active and performative 
shapers, not just of research processes, but also of the very institutions that we study. 
Elsewhere we have elaborated on the theoretical and empirical features of this approach 
(Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 2011; Gillespie 2013). Suffice it to say here, we treat methods 
as active agents that acquire a social life of their own as they are appropriated and put to 
use by different actors (BBC audience researchers, the market researchers who the BBC 
commission to undertake research on their behalf, academics). The uses of methods and of 
the data gathered shape, often profoundly, what is possible to know and say about an 
organisation. Our social life of methods approach goes beyond constructionist claims to 

Our methodological design was informed by a ‘social life of methods’ approach.2 This

practices, strategic goals and accountability processes, as well as public relations and 
corporate communications. Audience research methods at the BBCWS have a history and a 
genealogy. Social media also challenge what organisations like BBCWS do as journalism as 
well as what they do to know and understand their audiences (Gillespie, Mackay and Webb 
2011). Their research practices and the concepts that they use to define and measure the 
‘reach’ and ‘engagement’ are in flux as a result of changes in technologies, governance and 
funding regimes. Until 2014 the BBCWS received funding from the Foreign and 
Commonwealth Office but it now receives funding from the Licence Fee. It must justify its 
public value to UK citizens who know very little about Foreign Language Services for 
international audiences. It does so by producing ‘facts’ about its audiences and whether and 
how they engage with its services. Its future is at risk so audience research will play a critical 
role in how it develops as an organisation that is now integrating itself into the BBC 
Domestic Services. It is in this context that the ‘Tweeting the Olympics’ methodological 
framework and its social life of methods approach must be understood. 
The London Olympic Games promised a rich empirical case study to understand and 
 
assess how the BBCWS is adopting and adapting to social media and integrating it into their 
practices. Furthermore, this case provided an opportunity to analyse whether and how the 
conversations facilitated by the BBCWS contributed to intercultural dialogue across borders. 
In particular, we were interested in the language used and positions adopted by tweeters on 
controversial issues regarding representations of gender, the nation, religion and Olympic 
values, such as equality and fairness. 
 
all four case studies on the Arabic, English, Persian and Russian Language Services (see 
papers in this issue by Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin; Aslanyan and Gillespie; Shreim; Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi). The methodological framework necessarily involved mixed methods, and 
drew upon qualitative, quantitative and computational techniques. This reflected the 
interdisciplinary make-up of our research team, with scholars from computer science, 
cultural studies, media and communication, and political science. Secondly, we describe the 
different workflows adopted across this project. Due to the challenges of social media 
research and undertaking multi-lingual research, a number of creative workarounds3 were 
taken to address and facilitate the cultural specificities of research in each Language Service. 
Finally, the article reflects on the limitations of our research project, and some of the 
difficulties of research partnerships between academic and market researchers. But it also 
highlights what was learnt from this experiment in methods and in research collaborations. 
It also suggests possible fruitful methodological pathways for future research that were 
opened up by the Tweeting the Olympics project.  
  
 

In this article we first outline the overarching methodological approach used across

Research Design 
Our collaboration with the BBC World Service was based around an interactive Twitter 
Module that was integrated into the web sites for BBC Arabic, BBC Brasil, BBC Hausa, BBC 
Hindi, BBC Mundo, BBC Russian and BBC Turkish.4 The Twitter Module, developed by the 
BBCWS and social media analysis firm Tweetminster (http://tweetminster.co.uk/), is a 
visualisation module.5 It displays tweets in real-time from a list of Twitter accounts 
determined by the host organisation. The BBCWS populated the Twitter Module with a 
range of BBC corporate accounts, BBC staff accounts, pundits affiliated with the BBC and 
athletes.6 These lists were tailored to the interests of specific audiences for particular 
Language Services and programmes (see Appendix 1). The module was active 24/7 between 
22 July and 14 August 2012.  
 
Figure 1. Firstly, the wide module displayed the latest live tweets from those accounts pre-
approved by the BBC and a list of trends – the most frequently mentioned words by these 
accounts, the most shared URLs within the group and a list of the most active users (Vissens 
2012). Secondly, the narrow module displayed only the custom Twitter feed from the 
selected accounts. 
 

Two versions of the Twitter Module were used during the Olympics, as shown in 

 

 

Figure 1: An example of the Twitter Module 

 
Editors were asked to promote the Twitter Module on the websites of the respective 
Language Services, as well as on individual articles and across social media. The module was 
used to encourage real-time ‘engagement’ from audience members during the games. 
However, as Mackay (2012:12) identifies, the term engagement is very slippery and open to 
multiple interpretations for the BBCWS that may differ from those of academics. 
 
This relates to a key objective of the BBCWS, and one of the underlying themes of our 
research – facilitating a ‘global conversation’: 

Firstly, engagement can be understood in terms of fostering audience participation.

An informed and intelligent dialogue which transcends international borders 
and cultural divides; by giving communities around the world opportunities to 
create, publish, and share their own views and stories; and, thereby, enabling 
people to make sense of increasingly complex regional and global events and 
developments.  (BBC Trust 2007) 
 

The BBC World Service wanted an independent assessment and analysis of whether 

The definition above embeds a notion of global citizenship and intercultural dialogue, and a 
prior project evaluated the extent to which BBCWS practices matched their rhetoric on the 
global conversation.7 Evidence of audience engagement depends on how engagement is 
defined and the methods used to measure or assess engagement (Mackay 2012).  Analysis 
of engagement can be used to inform the editorial agenda, creating a feedback loop 
between the audience and content producers (Gillespie 2013; Hoskins and O’Loughlin 
2010:163).  
 
Secondly, engagement is also used as a synonym for reach – that is, ‘we have to 
engage more users’ (Mackay 2012:12). Unlike social analytics software, such as Sysomos 
MAP, that also provides insights on audience engagement, the Twitter Module itself has a 
very public function that may help the organisation increase audience share online.  As 
Vissens (2012) notes, the Twitter Module had previously been a success for BBC Russian 
during the 2012 Russian presidential election, as their Twitter audience increased by 2,000 
followers. The 2012 London Olympics provided a valuable opportunity to observe its 
effectiveness across a number of other Language Services.  
 
and how the Twitter Module fostered engagement and, in turn, if this benefitted the 
broadcaster in the long-term in terms of ratings and quality of discourse – although the 
academic research team was much more focussed on the latter. As we shall see in this 
article, the selection of accounts for the Twitter Module by the host organisation is of vital 
importance in determining the outcome and success of the Twitter Module (Shreim 2015). 
As we found in previous research, engagement is a two-way process (Gillespie 2013). How 
audiences engage with BBCWS is very much a response to how the journalist and editors 
manage to incite the interest of and attract the attention of users. For long the BBCWS have 
been somewhat risk averse in respect of social media, concerned about reputational 
damage and maintaining professional standards. And those most senior in the organisation 
are least skilled and adept in using social media. So the Twitter Module has to be 
understood and assessed in this wider context (Gillespie, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015).   
 
data. Each 140-character post can contain unique insights into micro-level attitudes and 
opinions. The attraction of this data is that it is generated voluntarily, independently of any 
research and the biases of their research design. This promises a more accurate or authentic 
representation of individual and social dynamics in the intersecting Twitterspheres created 
by large international news organisations like BBCWS. But the sheer volume of Twitter data 
that it is possible to collect can easily overwhelm and defy effective uses of qualitative and 

Social media platforms such as Twitter generate vast quantities of qualitatively rich

interpretive methods. This does not mean these methods should be avoided because with a 
judicious use of sampling techniques and a systematic approach, qualitative analysis of 
tweets is, as this special section shows, perfectly possible and very revealing. Nevertheless 
content and discourse analysis is time consuming and expensive in terms of human 
resources and our limited academic budget had to cut its cloth accordingly (see Hutchings et 
al this special section for more details of our specific approach to content and discourse 
analysis). These techniques were important for the project because the BBC does not 
undertake content or discourse analysis of the social media it generates. Our partners were 
excited by the potential knowledge gained in extending their usual research repertoire.  
 
quite simple,8 they are not well suited to exploring the complex motivational triggers or 
meanings behind the flows of interactions or the content of these messages in particular 
networks (see boyd and Crawford 2012). In order to understand the social context of 
communication flows, behaviours and interactions, qualitative techniques are much more 
useful (Anstead and O’Loughlin 2012). Our methodological framework combined 
computational tools with human expertise in order to analyse the content and discursive 
features of tweets. This would help us assess whether and how the Twitter Module 
successfully cultivated ‘a global conversation’.   

While the benefits of computational methods and big data research are intuitively 

As a first step, each research team used Sysomos MAP:  

(http://sysomos.com/products/map), a commercial text-mining platform (used by BBCWS 
and to which we were given privileged access and offered training), to identify events of 
interest for both the BBBCWS and the research team.  Sysomos MAP is not suitable for 
rigorous empirical research due to the lack of transparency about the sampling frame used 
when exporting large amounts of tweets from the service. As of August 2012, the export 
function was limited to 5,000 randomly selected tweets per search term. There is no clear 
indication how this process of randomisation is undertaken. This creates validity problems 
when dealing with larger datasets, as we were in this project. Furthermore, access to these 
tools can be very costly for academic research if not in partnership with subscribers like 
BBCWS, with Twitter only providing access to their archive to a handful of data re-sellers. 
Despite these risks, there are some benefits for researchers (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). Principally, the service grants access to the complete Twitter ‘Firehose’ archive, which 
refers to 100% of all public tweets. As such, Sysomos MAP guarantees analyses based on 
100% of the tweets that match the user-defined search criteria. This project used the 
platform as a means of pinpointing trends, peaks and troughs in Twitter flows, which 
allowed us to generate foci for in depth qualitative investigation using content and discourse 
analysis.  
 
triggered conversation on Twitter during the Games. By using Boolean searches and a range 
of visualisation tools we were able to narrow our focus onto these key events. Boolean 
searching allows the user to broaden or limit their search criteria by combining search terms 
with Boolean operators, such as ‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’. We then used three visualisation 

A number of Sysomos MAP features were used to identify those events that

tools, shown in Figure 2, to explore the peaks in conversation. We were able to generate 
data about the volume of Twitter conversations on particular topics over time (‘Popularity 
graphs’), quick conversation snapshots in the form of wordclouds and ‘Buzzgraphs’ that 
visualised which words were commonly used together within tweets and the strength of 
these relationships. In short, the social analytics provided by Sysomos MAP offered a basis 
to select events for further analysis.   

The next step in our workflow was for the research team to choose five accounts 

It is important to note that we did not necessarily choose the five accounts for each 

that were significant and salient to each Language Service and subject these to further 
analysis. These were selected from a list of all accounts included within the Twitter Module 
for each respective Language Service. BBC Persian did not use a Twitter Module for 
technical reasons (see Section 1.4). Instead, five accounts were selected on the basis of 
interviews with staff at BBC Persian.  
 
Language Service in terms of popularity, measured in terms of the volume of interactions 
with each Twitter account. While popularity was a key determinant for exploring the 
effectiveness of the Twitter Module, in order to understand engagement in a way that is 
useful to the BBC it was also important to observe instances where communication failed to 
generate audience interaction, or perhaps lead to unintended consequences (Aslan, Dennis 
and O’Loughlin 2, this issue). For example, the BBC.com research team selected both Clare 
Balding (@clarebalding1), the retired jockey and BBC television presenter, and Matthew 
Pinsent (@matthewpinsent), Olympic gold medallist rower and broadcaster. Despite 
similarly high profile roles in the televised coverage of the games, Pinsent was mentioned 
9,500 times in comparison to 57,047 mentions of Balding. As such, by selecting a mixture of 
accounts -- some that were very active and others where we may have expected higher 
levels of interactions -- we were able to provide the BBCWS with cases to illustrate what did 
or did not generate effective audience engagement by their journalists and pundits. 
 
While Sysomos MAP has Firehose access, how the service filters tweets is not 
transparent. As such, the computer scientists involved in this research project (Procter, Voss 
and Lvov, this issue) designed an analysis workflow in order to generate valid and reliable 
samples from Twitter. As Figure 3 shows, this consisted of five key stages: (1) drawing on a 
range of data collection tools to harvest tweets; (2) undertaking an analysis of how often 
tweets have been retweeted to identify significant ‘information flows’; (3) working 
collaboratively to design a coding framework suitable for researchers working on each 
Language Service, followed by each study manually coding roughly 1,800 tweets (specific 
volumes are detailed below); (4) generating a range of visualisations for presentation back 
to the BBCWS; (5) using heat-maps to cross-tabulate different sets of codes.

Figure 2: Sysomos MAP social analytics used for this research project 

 
Our study used an early version of a data collection tool that is now available as part of the 
COSMOS Desktop Software9 (http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/cosmos/). This tool uses Twitter’s 
Streaming API to harvest tweets.10 This API is useful for researchers given that it is freely 
available but limits the user to a 1% sample of all public tweets (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this 
issue). The data that is collected must be specified in advance, using a list of keywords (e.g.

                                        May 2015 

 
hashtags) and/or a list of Twitter accounts. The Streaming API provides all tweets sent by a 
given account, all tweets retweeted that originate from this account, as well as all tweets 
containing mentions of this account. Using this tool we generated a collection of tweets 
based on roughly 1,000 accounts identified by the BBC (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). 
In total 5,509,928 tweets were collected for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic 
games. The full corpus included 3,906,569 English tweets, 71,251 Russian tweets and 62,872 
Arabic tweets. While this data is more limited than Sysomos MAP, since all tweets are 
collected on the basis of selected time frames, keywords and accounts, the software’s 
operation is fundamentally transparent. This data collection formed the basis of the 
datasets used in the BBC Arabic, BBC.com and BBC Russian studies.  
 

 

Figure 3: Analysis workflow  
 

BBC Persian did not use the Twitter Module, and therefore no Persian tweeters were 
included within the BBC’s list of 1,000 Twitter accounts. BBC Persian took a different 
approach. The research team used Sysomos MAP to collect all tweets relating to the five 
selected accounts. By using the search criteria ‘to:’ and ‘from:’ (that is, tweets mentioning 
the account and posts published by the account), the datasets that were retrospectively 
exported were similar to those generated in real-time by the Streaming API. The 
disadvantage of this is that Sysomos MAP is not transparent; we have little understanding of 
the sampling frame used by the service when sampling from large volumes of tweets. For 
the BBC Persian case study we were able to export 100 percent of the tweets required for 
our analyses. Furthermore, the researchers were unable to extract tweets using this method

five accounts selected. Each corpus contained their tweets, together with those mentioning 
or addressed to them, and these were then filtered by keywords to identify the most 
popular conversations relating to the five chosen events. This approach was taken as the 
next stage of the research design was discourse analysis and it was important that 
researchers had a manageable dataset to code and analyse the themes emerging on Twitter 
within the conversations that took place. Without narrowing the scope of our accounts, it 
would be difficult to track the rich thematic conversations that formed the basis of our 
qualitative analysis. 
Given our datasets for manual coding were limited to a maximum of 2,000 tweets, it 
 
was important to use a reliable sampling frame. Any collection of tweets can be divided into 
tweets that are ‘original’ and retweets – a repost of a message posted by another user. We 
used a simple computational tool to group a tweet and its retweets into information flows. 
Ranking information flows by size provides a way to determine the relative significance of 
each tweet, narrowing our focus on significant information flows, key influencers and 
trajectory shifts. 
 
Appendix 2). The schema was designed collaboratively to accommodate the research 
priorities of all four language case studies. The first iteration of the framework was based 
loosely on the schema used in the Reading the Riots project (Procter, Vis and Voss 2013). 
This framework was then refined after each researcher coded a small number of tweets 
from their respective sample. Figure 4 (below) illustrates an example of our coding schema 
applied to a tweet, included as part of our analysis of Nicola Adams’ boxing gold in the 
Women’s flyweight.  

A coding framework was then designed to analyse these collections of tweets (see 

As shown in Figure 4, the coding framework enabled researchers to code the type of 

Content and discourse analysis allowed us to observe and evaluate audience 

actor publishing the tweet, the type of tweet (if the tweet was a reply to another user, for 
example), and identify any expressive comments on gender, nationalism, religion, and/or 
Olympic values. We coded using these themes to gain analytical purchase on the nature of 
‘the global conversation’: Who was reacting to whom? When was communication linear or 
projection and when was it more dialogic or conversational? How did users react to the BBC 
coverage and its social media output?  
 
engagement across each Language Service. For example, content analysis of BBC Arabic 
suggested that their audience members expressed a great deal of national pride in the 
sporting efforts of a wide range of athletes, irrespective of their performance. However, 
sport was not the only focus for the BBC Russian or the BBC Persian audiences; for them, 
discussion around the Olympics often became politicised. We could then use discourse 
analysis to interpret how meanings emerged from the particular context of the Russian 
public sphere. In terms of audience reaction to BBC content, the research team analysing

BBC.com found that controversy drives engagement with the BBC on Twitter and then used 
discourse analysis to explore the ways users brought gender and nationality into debates. 
These findings are explored in further detail in this special issue. 

 

 

Figure 4: An example of a tweet annotated using the coding framework 
 

In preparing the research for dissemination back to the BBCWS, the research team 

A total of 6,888 tweets were manually coded across the four Language Services. While all 
researchers met and coded a small sample of tweets together, they clearly had different 
coding experiences. This is not to say that the content analysis was entirely subjective. 
Without the resources to conduct a coding verification check we simply note these 
limitations, while acknowledging the vital importance of the discourse analysis in helping to 
explain who influenced conversation trajectories and the relationship of particular tweets to 
broader thematic discussions. 
 
collaboratively designed a range of visualisations (see Figure 5). Creating these was an 
important part of the research design. Given our interdisciplinary research team, we held a 
number of weekly meetings over Skype to try and find the most effective way to visualize 
the results given our multi-faceted coding schema. Initially, visualisations took the form of 
bar charts and pie charts. These proved to be an effective way of exploring a single set of 
codes, such as the actor type or tweets relating to the nation.  
 
As part of the BBC.com case study the researchers examined the audience reaction 
to Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the 5000m. Figure 5 shows how the majority of 

 

Page 448 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
tweets in relation to conceptions of the nation were celebrating Mo Farah’s victory as a 
British athlete. While this explains the content of audience engagement, our aim to observe 
the ‘global conversation’ – one that transcends national, ethnic and religious boundaries – 
meant that we needed visual representations of the intersection of different sets of codes. 

 

Figure 5: An example pie chart illustrating the frequency of codes relating to the nation 
in our analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in the men’s 5000m 

 

 

In order to visualise the relationships between different codes we produced heat maps, 
graphical representations of the coded data in which codes were assigned a colour 
dependent on their overall frequency. To produce the visualisations we implemented a 
custom Java program to pre-process the Excel sheets containing our coded data and then 
fed the data into R (http://www.r-project.org/), a statistical package. These visualisations 
came in two forms: absolute heat maps, and relative heat maps. 

Figure 6 shows an absolute heat map from our analysis of Mo Farah’s victory. This is 
a heat map of the type of tweet posted (x-axis and section B of the coding framework – see 
Appendix 2) and codes relating to the ‘Nation’ (y-axis and section E of the coding 
framework). After cross-tabulating these codes we assigned each field a colour - those codes 
with a higher frequency were more strongly coloured blue. In doing so it becomes 
immediately clear that the vast majority of tweets are coded at (11, 1) – tweets that interact 
with an athlete and also celebrate the performance of the home nation. This further 
explains the finding from the initial pie chart shown in Figure 5, showing that the majority of 

 

Page 449 

Volume 12, Issue 1 
                                        May 2015 

 
these tweets were directed to Mo Farah himself, wishing him good luck or later 
congratulating him on his victory.  
 

 

Figure 6: An example of an absolute heat map, illustrating the type of tweet (x-axis) and 
codes relating to the nation (y-axis) in the analysis of Mo Farah’s gold medal performance 
in the men’s 5000m. 

 
We also produced relative heat maps, which visualised the frequency of codes relatively by 
either columns or rows. The absolute heat maps focus attention on the distinctive blue 
fields, ignoring other fields that may have a low frequency but also may still be qualitatively 
interesting. By plotting relative heat maps it was possible to visualise the more nuanced 
differences in coding patterns. This was evident in the analysis of the Chinese swimmer Ye 
Shiwen, in which Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin (this issue) identified that the majority of 
conversation with BBC accounts related to issues of fairness. As Figure 7 (below) shows, 28 
tweets criticised BBC accounts directly in light of the line of questioning pursued by Clare 
Balding following Ye Shiwen’s performance. 

In this way, heat maps were a meaningful way of visualising and contextualising the 

findings from the manual coding.  

Each of the different strands of this project followed this methodology to some 
degree. However, our research design had to remain adaptable in order to account for 
limitations in our data as well as, simply, what happened during the Olympics. While our 
ability to compare across the Language Services was hampered by our fragmenting (or 

 

Page 450 

 
blossoming) research design, this organic process allowed the researchers to engage with 
the emerging themes and questions in their respective dataset.

1.  Language Services in Focus 
 
1.1  BBC Arabic 
Shreim (2015) in this special section drew upon a mixed-method research design to explore 
whether the social media strategy used by BBC Arabic resulted in a ‘global conversation’. 
Prior to conducting a discourse analysis of data collected from COSMOS, the researcher 
conducted an online participation observation of BBC Arabic’s online coverage, with a 
particular focus on issues around gender, religion, national and cosmopolitan sensibilities 

 

Page 451 

Volume 12, Issue 1

Alongside the results from exploratory keyword searches on Sysomos MAP, the data 

 
and identities. The observation was conducted four hours per day for three days in the early 
stages of the games. This was staggered, with data collected between the hours of 9-10am, 
1-2pm, 5-6pm, and 9-10pm. This design was used in order to be close to breaking news, and 
to track the development of stories over time. The researcher also monitored the Al-Jazeera 
Arabic website and BBC.com as a means of comparison. The findings helped the research 
team understand the emerging themes within the output of BBC Arabic.  
 
gathered during the observation period was used to identify five events for discourse 
analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing Ceremony; (3) the participation of Arab 
women during the Olympics; (4) the weak performance of Arab athletes; and (5) 
celebrations of Arab performance. Participant-observation proved to be a valuable way of 
recognising those events that closely matched the research aims of the researchers. They 
were also of clear interest to the objectives of BBC Arabic. For example, the audience 
response to the Opening and Closing Ceremonies allowed the researcher to pay special 
attention to issues of cultural diplomacy. Likewise, the unprecedented representation of 
female athletes from the Middle East provided an opportunity to explore how issues of 
gender were framed and debated by those accounts interacting with the Twitter Module.  
 
study of BBC Arabic was not based on specific competitions and incidents but was often 
spread over longer periods of time. This was a result of the lack of engagement with the BBC 
Arabic Twitter Module during the Olympic Games. In the initial Sysomos MAP search there 
were only 284 tweets mentioning BBC Arabic. This was because there were only three BBC 
Arabic journalists covering the Olympic Games on Twitter, all of whom had low numbers of 
followers. As such, the five accounts selected from the Twitter Module to generate the 
corpus did not feature BBC journalists: Qatar Olympic Team (@qatar_olympic); دمحم رمع لا 
(@alomar26); م لاس  يب ق ن
national team (@Olympic_Egypt); and Reem Abulleil (@ReemAbulleil). Furthermore, as a 
result of the lack of interaction with BBC Arabic Twitter accounts, the search criteria were 
broadened to include some accounts from outside the Twitter Module list. In total, the 
sample consisted of 6,634 tweets from 577 Twitter accounts. The researcher coded 1,686 
tweets. This total was in line with the number of tweets coded by researchers analysing the 
other Language Services. 
 
1.2  BBC.com 
The BBC.com research team followed a similar research design to the general workflow 
described earlier in this article. Following an initial analysis of trends over the course of the 
Olympic Games using Sysomos MAP, the researchers identified five events for further 
analysis: (1) the representation of the National Health Service (NHS) during the Opening 
Ceremony; (2) the performance of the American swimmer Michael Phelps throughout the 
games; (3) the false accusations of doping following Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen’s gold 
medal in the women’s 400m individual medley; (4) Mo Farah’s gold medal performance in 

In comparison to the other Language Services, the sample of events selected for our

A total of ten accounts were selected from the BBC.com Twitter Module. This 

It is important to note that domestic, UK-based BBC Twitter accounts feature heavily 

 
the men’s 5,000m; and (5) Britain’s Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal in women’s 
boxing.  
 
included an additional five accounts in comparison to the five selected by the other 
Language Services. This was due to the greater volume and variety of accounts included 
within the Twitter Module, with 43 journalists and pundits, 412 Team GB athletes, and 55 
accounts the BBC had identified as having the potential to create buzz and wider audience 
engagement. The researchers selected five BBC pundits: Gary Lineker (@garylineker); Jake 
Humphrey (@mrjakehumphrey); Clare Balding (@clarebalding1); Matthew Pincent 
(@matthewcpinsent); and Jonathan Edwards (@JDE66). Five additional accounts were 
selected, including both members of Team GB and influential athletes taking part during the 
games: British cyclist Bradley Wiggins (@bradwiggins); British diver Tom Daley 
(@TomDaley1994); Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt (@usainbolt); American swimmer Ryan 
Lochte (@ryanlochte); and Australian cyclist Anna Meares (@AnnaMeares).  
 
in both the findings provided to the BBC and in the article included in this special issue 
(Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This is because these accounts, such as 
@BBCSport, were included in the original lists provided to us by the organisation; the social 
media strategy for BBC.com had clear overlap with the output of the BBC UK.  
 
After keyword searches yielded total samples for each event, the team’s computer 
scientists filtered these samples to provide the researchers with final samples based on the 
output of accounts linked to the Twitter Module. These datasets contained the most 
retweeted tweets in each total sample. In total 1,824 tweets were analysed using the coding 
schema. There were some discrepancies in the overall volume of tweets coded for each 
event. The final samples for the NHS and Ye Shiwen events were small, at 81 and 243 each. 
We therefore coded larger samples for the other events, with 600 tweets analysed on Mo 
Farah’s and Nicola Adam’s respective victories. 
 
of the BBC, these volumes are vastly reduced when compared to the total population of 
tweets mentioning the BBC more generally in relation to the five events. The researchers 
extracted 3,404 tweets on Mo Farah and 1,588 posts on Ye Shiwen using keyword searches 
on Sysomos MAP. These searches produced higher overall volumes of tweets than those 
collected using COSMOS. This is because a keyword search over all Twitter data has more 
matches than an equivalent search over a pre-selected dataset, such as the one used for our 
analysis which was restricted to the list of accounts included within the Twitter Module.  
 
Ye Shiwen case study and the reaction from Twitter users to an offhand comment from BBC 
Sport presenter Clare Balding immediately following the live broadcast of the women’s 
400m individual medley on 28 July, 2012. This was the most interesting event given the 
thematic overlap with the research priorities. The initial coding of 243 tweets included 
examples of cross-cultural discourse, discussions relating to the athlete’s gender and 

As one may expect given the adoption rates of Twitter in the UK and the prominence 

After delivering these findings to the BBC, the researchers turned their focus to the

confrontation driven by nationalist sentiments. The article in this issue, ‘Balding Goes 
Trolling? Cross-Media Amplification of Controversy at the 2012 Olympics’, offers a cross-
medium analysis of the case study, tracing the controversy as it moved between different 
social networks and media platforms over a period of five days. The trajectory of the 
controversy moved beyond the parameters of our current dataset of tweets collected using 
COSMOS, which was restricted to interactions with accounts included in the Twitter 
Module. As such, the researchers ran a series of new queries using keyword searches in 
Sysomos (Aslan, Dennis and O’Loughlin, this issue). This generated new sets of Twitter data, 
with a random sample of 5,000 tweets about Ye Shiwen, from a total population of 30,735, 
and 8,058 tweets mentioning Clare Balding’s account handle (@clarebalding1). These 
tweets were collected between 28 July and 1 August, 2012. The researchers also analysed a 
range of national and international media through which this controversy unfolded. Our 
sampling strategy began with a systematic search using Lexis Nexis; we added further 
emerging stories once we began tracing the interactions. These datasets provided the basis 
for the qualitative study. 

 

Initially, five accounts were selected on the basis of those included in the Twitter 

1.3  BBC Russian 
The final Language Service that our project analysed that used the Twitter Module was BBC 
Russian. While the BBC were interested in how effective the Twitter Module was in 
facilitating engagement, our project also sought to explore the perception of Britain 
amongst Russian-speaking Twitter users.  
 
Module by the producers at BBC Russian. However, this was later increased to seven 
accounts in order to provide a total number of tweets in line with other Language Services. 
They consisted of two BBC Russian journalists (Скороходов Никанор, @RSaanti; Nastya 
Uspenskaya, @AnastasiaBim), two editors of Russian sports publications (Василий Конов, 
@VasilyKonov; Георгий Черданцев, @cherdantsev), a former Russian Olympic champion 
turned politician (Светлана Журова, @szhurova), a sports official representing the Russian 
Federation (Дмитрий Чернышенко, @ChernyshenkoRu) and a Russian blogger living in 
London (Konstantin Pinaev, @moscowlondon). These accounts were selected on the basis 
that they were among the most active on the Twitter Module. 
 
BBC World Service, the researcher noted that this sample was not representative of the 
Russian audience on Twitter. In total, tweets from 494 accounts were coded. When coding 
for actor type, that is, the type of user who published the tweet, it became apparent that 
the sample was overrepresented by users affiliated to Russian media outlets. These 
constituted 87 accounts, or 17.6 per cent of the sample. Consequently, tweets were often 
factual rather than expressive. A plurality of the accounts analysed – 188 accounts, or 38 per 
cent of the sample – belonged to members of the public. However, their tweets were far 
less opinionated and open than one may expect.  

Given that the dataset was drawn from a number of Twitter accounts selected by the

                                        May 2015 

In total, 1,874 tweets were coded across the five events. As with the BBC.com 

 

On the basis of the trends identified from exploratory searches on Sysomos MAP, 

 
 
five events were chosen for further analysis: (1) the Opening Ceremony; (2) the Closing 
Ceremony; (3) the women’s Singles Tennis final between Maria Sharapova and Serena 
Williams; (4) the men’s Volleyball final; and (5) Vladimir Putin’s appearance at the games on 
2 August 2012.  
 
corpus, these tweets were not spread evenly across the five events. As such, the research 
team had to adapt the search criteria by relaxing the time constraints for most events. The 
researcher also manually picked a small number of additional tweets from the seven 
accounts; these tweets did not contain any keywords but did relate to the events - a 
problem we reflect upon in the conclusion. 
 
1.4  BBC Persian 
BBC Persian was the only Language Service included in our project that did not feature a 
Twitter Module on their website during the games. This decision was made for technical 
reasons (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). This provided an important point of comparison 
that allowed the research team to compare levels of audience engagement with those 
Language Services that did use the Twitter Module.  
 
In order to make these comparisons it was important to analyse the performance of 
BBC Persian Twitter accounts over the course of the games. As there was no pre-determined 
list of accounts, the researcher selected those accounts that would offer insights into the 
performance of the BBC Persian social media strategy. Five accounts were chosen. Three 
were corporate accounts: BBC Persian (@bbcpersian); BBC Persian Sport 
(@bbcpersiansport); and BBC Nowbat-e Shoma (Your Turn) (@bbcshoma). The other two 
accounts were from prominent Twitter users who were also BBC Persian employees: Nima 
Akbarpour (@nima) and Sanam Dolatshahi (@khorshid). These BBC journalists were 
selected given their high follower count, with 61,200 followers and 24,200 followers 
respectively (as of April 2015). 
 
selected on the basis of the trends observed using Sysomos MAP: (1) The Opening 
Ceremony, and the reaction of the Persian speaking world to representations of Britain; (2) 
the disqualification of the Iranian heavyweight boxer Ali Mazaheri; (3) ‘Golden Tuesday’ on 7 
August 2012, when Iran won four gold medals; (4) the questions raised over the standard of 
refereeing during the quarter-final of the men’s Greco-Roman wrestling event between 
Iranian wrestler Saeed Abdevali and his French counterpart Steeve Guenot; and (5) the 
Closing Ceremony, which included the reaction of the Persian speaking world to the 
performance of the Iranian, Afghan and Tajik Olympic teams over the course of the games. 
 
Extracting the tweets for the five accounts around these events proved a challenge. 
The collection extracted using COSMOS was based around Twitter accounts identified by the 
BBCWS. Instead the research team used Sysomos MAP and the RESTful Twitter API to

retrospectively collect all tweets to (@mentions) and from the five accounts. In total 1,504 
tweets were manually coded. 
To explore the strategic differences in the use of social media by BBC Persian, and 
 
given the absence of the Twitter Module, the researcher also observed the production of 
two episodes of the interactive programme Nobat-e Shoma (Your Turn), in which audience 
contributions play an important role in shaping the content of each episode. The 
programme is broadcast for 50 minutes, five days a week (Saturday-Wednesday) to Persian-
speaking audiences from around the world. The programme specifically targets Iran, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. The series began at the same time as the launch of BBC Persian 
TV in January 2009. Their major competitors are Radio Farda, VOA Persian and Deutsche 
Welle Persian.  
 
programmes on the Olympics. The researcher observed the creation and filming of two of 
these episodes. Informal interviews were also conducted with members of the production 
team regarding the nature of their work.

Research 

Social media research methods, despite their rapid emergence and proliferation, are still in 
an early stage of development. Therefore, all social media research is, to a greater or lesser 
extent, experimental. ‘Big data’ can be regarded as the new gold standard – promising 
forms of knowledge production previously unattainable. But it is wise to be cautious, as 
Karpf points out: 
 

The  new  media  environment  demands  new  techniques.  Those  techniques 
carry  risks  –  they  have  not  undergone  the  years  of  seasoning  and 
sophistication that dominant methods have. But they also carry the promise 
of expanding the scope of our inquiry and applying intellectual rigor to topics 
of broad social significance.  (Karpf 2012:641) 

 
While academic researchers may seek to take the intellectual high ground and proclaim the 
superiority of their conceptual and methodological tools, corporations, market researchers 
and commercial social media monitoring businesses pose a threat to empirical social science 
research, as others have argued (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue). Research partnerships 
are therefore vital if social science audience research is to access data and keep abreast of 
the latest developments in methods but they come with risks and costs – not so much to the 
independence of the research but more because data collected by market audience 
research are framed primarily by commercial imperatives – more concerned with using data 
to increasing market competiveness than to enhance the quality of intercultural dialogue. 
Therefore there are difficult tensions and trade-offs that must be negotiated.

Accessing the data required for research purposes is difficult enough (see boyd and 

 
 
evidence and analyses of how an international news organisation like the BBCWS is adapting 
to social media and how and why they are integrating it into their practices. However, just 
as we show the challenges that the BBC faces as it refines its use of Twitter to foster 
audience engagement, we must also detail the methodological obstacles that we faced in 
trying to conduct research on Twitter. In this relatively early stage of social media research 
we have as much to gain from failure as from success. 
 
Crawford 2012), but doing so in a valid and reliable way across a number of different 
languages produced an array of hurdles. These drawbacks were at times amplified by the 
requirement to manage an interdisciplinary team who instinctively follow the assumptions 
and procedures of very different research traditions. The different Language Services were 
very different resourced, had diverse experience and expertise in using social media, and 
unexpected factors intervened in the uses of Twitter. For example, in the relatively well-
resourced BBC Arabic Service, staff resources for administering the Twitter Module were at 
an all-time low due to the coincidence of the London Games with Ramadan – a time when 
staff take annual leave. This kind of ethnographic insight is vital in understanding the very 
low number of tweets generated by BBC Arabic staff during the Games (Shreim 2015). The 
BBC Persian Service did not use the Twitter Module but fared better than the other 
Language Services in terms of the quantity and the quality of their engagement with the 
users (Voss and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). Big data requires contextualising with human 
analysis via ethnographic, content, discourse and other forms of qualitative analysis. 
 
David Karpf (2012:654) calls a ‘kludge’; a creative, but problematic, fix used to achieve a 
certain solution. Methodological design to investigate Twitter use is both an art and a 
science – a creative and challenging intellectual problem to solve that straddles Humanities, 
Computer and Social Sciences. But the social life of methods approach pays due recognition 
to the fact that the enactment of methods is a messy, iterative, flawed human social 
process. As such our methodological tactics constantly evolved to circumvent problems 
during the data collection and sampling stages - as well as during the collaborative analyses 
that endured long after the empirical research ended and up to the production of this 
special section.  
 
research that, in this case, had to meet the objectives of a highly competitive news industry 
and academia should not be underestimated. On the one hand, we had to align our research 
with the BBC’s aims, independently assessing the value of the Twitter Module on audience 
engagement. Our initial research design was tailored to deliver findings for the BBCWS. 
However, we also had priorities, planning to investigate the dynamics of national and 
cosmopolitan imagination in new media representations of the London Olympics. The 
sampling frame and coding framework were not designed to produce ready-made answers 
to these questions. Instead, the analyses evolved from the data and from a multi-staged

Firstly, by basing our samples around the accounts in the Twitter Module, or those of 

 
process – from the initial findings we delivered to the BBCWS in a series of ‘data workshops’ 
to presentations in academic and policy circles. Therefore our methodology evolved 
reflexively and iteratively, adapting to address evolving issues and the interests of the 
research team. In this sense, this article is a post-hoc rationale of the methodological 
framework for the study – one which we hope can be flexibly adapted by others given its 
transparency. 
 
A key component of David Karpf’s (2012) methodological approach is transparency: 
so the flaws of our methodology should be made explicit. This final section will illustrate the 
limitations of our research design and the scope that exists for future multi-lingual audience 
research on Twitter. 
 
affiliated corporate accounts in the case of BBC Persian, we missed a wide range of 
pertinent discussion in the Twittersphere. For example, those researchers analysing the 
BBC.com dataset found representations of the NHS in the Opening Ceremony proved to be 
somewhat of an outlier, producing just 81 tweets. However, the impression from an earlier 
reading of tweets collected using Sysomos MAP suggested that there was evidence of the 
BBC fostering intercultural dialogue. These tweets were not captured by the Streaming API 
as they did not mention any of the 1000 accounts included in the Twitter Module; often 
these tweets did not mention any account but discussed the BBC more generally. Similarly, 
the BBC Russian dataset highlighted that working with the list of BBC-approved accounts 
affected the language and tone of the tweets that were gathered – rendering an image of a 
sanitised, politically correct Twittersphere in contrast to the more uninhibited Twitterverses 
available (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this issue). This uncharacteristically subdued BBC Russian 
Twittersphere – perhaps in line with its public diplomacy goal not to tell people what to 
debate but how to debate in a BBC style – was inclusive, fact-based and moving towards 
informed conclusions (Gillespie 2013). Given that many of the accounts selected for 
inclusion in the Twitter Module belonged to institutions or individuals acting in an official 
capacity, the majority of conversation exhibited a degree of civility that is not conventional 
in the wider Twittersphere. Thus, our aims to explore conversation on topics such as gender, 
nationalism or religion were at times restrained by our sampling frame.  
 
dialogue that was fostered by the BBC’s output on other online platforms (for more details 
see Gill, Abdel Sattar and Lami 2015) The BBC’s large portfolio of television channels, 
websites, radio stations and mobile applications would have undoubtedly led to 
conversation in other digital spaces, on other social media platforms, on forums and in 
private forms of mediated communication. Twitter only provides a small snapshot of social 
media use. These conversations may shed a different light on the nature of cross-border 
conversations that emerged throughout the Olympics.

tweets (see Jungherr 2014). Throughout the project we systematically used keyword 

Secondly, by focusing on Twitter, attention was not given to the intercultural 

Thirdly, using keywords to refine large collections of social data can compromise the

Fourthly, our comparison between different Language Services of the BBC World 

 
searches, firstly to identify trends over time in Sysomos MAP and then to produce 
manageable datasets for coding using COSMOS. In the process of comparing the data from 
both platforms it became evident that keywords sometimes miss discussion as users discuss 
topics while omitting our specific search criteria. As Jungherr (2014:18) notes, researchers 
may also find false positives in their dataset, ‘using the keyword without referring to the 
topic under discussion.’ 
 
Service would have been improved had there been a shared event to analyse. Originally we 
intended to study the Opening and Closing Ceremonies in respect to each Language Service 
as a means of comparison. This would have created comparable observations of 
engagement on Twitter by the BBCWS during the same event. However, we were unable to 
harvest enough tweets to do this analysis. This was not directly due to the research design 
per se, but a result of the parameters imposed on our dataset by our collaboration with the 
BBCWS, who mandated a focus on Twitter Module accounts. This highlights a disjuncture 
between the research design and the realities of research. Despite the lack of congruency in 
the events studies, it is important to note that all the events selected were done so on the 
basis of observable peaks in audience activity using Sysomos MAP and that all events also 
shared the same research themes and questions. The value of salience trumped 
comparability. We had to be sensitive to the fact that different events and key words were 
salient in each Language Service and that straightforward comparisons were rendered 
difficult. 
 
the research lacked coding reliability. Prior to commencing discourse analysis the whole 
research team did meet in person in order to code the same sample of tweets. However, 
despite our attempts to improve inter-coder reliability, the difficulties of language 
specialism made inter-coding large quantities of the same tweets difficult.  
 
within the territories of nation-states, may obfuscate the vast differences in internet 
adoption and social media use across the world. Different countries often have distinctive 
political cultures and media systems. Thought is needed about how future research should 
address, accommodate and explore these political and cultural differences. 
 
harness social media users’ conversations. A comparison between other comparable 
international media organisations would potentially highlight differences in engagement 
strategies. Some subtle differences did emerge within our research and it would be 
interesting to delve deeper into these and analyse how different media organisation 
approach audience engagement on social media. 
 
Secondly, future research should analyse ambiguous cases, those that don’t explicitly 
fit the case selection criteria. This study based case selection either on the volume of tweets 
over time measured using Sysomos MAP, or on the basis of identifiable symbolic moments, 
such as the representation of Saudi women during the games. However, it may be that such

obvious moments generate predictable conversations as users follow ‘scripts’ or 
expectations about what is say-able or should be said. It may be that ambiguous objects, 
where there are some points of reference but no single, obvious point of reference or 
precedent, could result in differentiated and more ambivalent or even creative perspectives. 
 
this? This project explored the role of the BBC in an event the BBC covered, so it was 
perhaps predictable we would find some BBC influence. Ultimately, our questions 
concerned what kind of influence and engagement the BBC was cultivating. However, if we 
were to reach a greater understanding of the BBC’s role within ‘the global conversation’ per 
se, not just the BBC’s constructed global conversation, it would be essential to study an 
event that is not organised and covered by the BBC. This would offer a more valid diagnosis 
of the BBC’s actual role. For instance, identifying the BBC’s role during the 2012 
Paralympics, which was broadcast in the UK on Channel 4, would have been a useful way to 
see how the BBC and its Twitter Module can foster or harness existing conversation and 
drive users to BBC content. Given there is only a limited set of events the BBC can possibly 
cover, it would be invaluable to understand how the BBC can engage users in events when it 
does not provide the platform, focus and framing. 
 
research design, we feel our project provides significant empirical findings on how 
international news organisations like the BBCWS are using Twitter in their journalistic 
output. We were also able to offer an in-depth, cross-platform case study in which we 
explore the complex tensions that emerge between international news organisations and 
Twitter users as they compete to control an event’s framing. 
Our project also offers a valuable methodological case study in the burgeoning field 
 
of Twitter research. Firstly, it exemplifies the value, but also the challenges, of undertaking 
multi-language research. Comparative perspectives of social media use are increasingly 
important given that perspectives from Anglo-American academia dominate the field. Our 
research reflects on the similarities and differences in audience behavior on Twitter from 
around the globe. 
 
time global events. In doing so we see our research design complementing the qualitative 
(e.g. Chadwick 2011), quantitative (e.g. Vaccari et al. 2015) and computational (e.g. Freelon 
and Karpf 2015) approaches used to analyse other events on Twitter in real-time (see 
Jungherr 2014). 
 
importance of mixed methods in Twitter research. In this study we attempted to combine 
both qualitative methods and computational traditions in ways that draw on their 
respective strengths. Computational tools help discover the more salient or un-typical 
content, while qualitative methods make sense of their meaning. Undoubtedly this 
collaboration brought challenges given the epistemological and ontological differences 
between computer science and social science, but it was in these exchanges where we

Finally, the ethical implications of Twitter research brought challenges. The 

 
found real value, as researchers learnt from one another. This and the other two 
methodological papers in this special section (Procter, Voss and Lvov, this issue; Willis, 
Fisher and Lvov, this issue), are indicative of this interdisciplinary exchange between social 
and computer scientists. Given the formative stages of Twitter research and the unique 
affordances required for both access to tweets and analysis of their content and the 
international social and communications networks forged, it is imperative researches 
embrace inter-disciplinarity. The methodological framework designed for this study was 
recreated and developed in the study on the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics in this special 
issue (Hutchings et al., this issue). It is also being used in further projects – testimony to the 
social life of methods approach not just in academia.  
 
questions surrounding the ethics of online data collection have been written about at great 
length (boyd and Crawford, 2012). However, the variety of standards and norms across 
different disciplines about how to use and cite tweets indicates that we have yet to reach 
definitive conclusions as to what constitutes best practice. For some, informed consent is 
sacrosanct and therefore no information that directly identifies an individual Twitter user 
should be used within research outputs. For others, especially those coming from a 
qualitative tradition, it is often necessary to refer to specific tweets as an illustration of a 
case, context, or culture. In doing so, even if no user information is provided, a simple 
search on Twitter using this text will still identify the user responsible. 
 
posed to the user when sharing tweets publicly: 
 

From a purely legal standpoint, the privacy policy for Twitter clearly states the risks 

Your  public  user  profile  information  and  public  Tweets  are  immediately 
delivered  via  SMS  and  our  APIs  to  our  partners  and  other  third  parties, 
including  search  engines,  developers,  and  publishers  that  integrate  Twitter 
content  into  their  services,  and  institutions  such  as  universities  and  public 
health  agencies  that  analyze  the  information  for  trends  and  insights.  When 
you  share  information  or  content  like  photos,  videos,  and  links  via  the 
Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public (Twitter 
2015). 

 
However, taking this privacy policy at face value is problematic, as ‘just because content is 
publicly accessible does not mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone’ (boyd 
and Crawford 2012:672). Given that much of the advice provided by professional 
associations is either unclear or contradictory, we, as researchers, have a responsibility to 
consider the potential privacy risks to subjects. As such, the authors of each paper in this 
special issue were given the option to choose how they wished to reference the data 
collected from Twitter. For some, this meant anonymising tweets to protect the anonymity 
of individual Twitter users in the highly politically sensitive Persian social media sphere (Voss 
and Asgari-Targhi, this issue). The authors of the Russian article (Aslanyan and Gillespie, this

Such ethical issues are likely to continue to challenge researchers for the foreseeable 

 
issue) in contrast used Twitter names many of which, in the case of the Russian corpus, 
were already pseudonyms. Moreover, it was considered that the Russian authorities 
constantly monitor social networks using far more sophisticated methods than those 
available to us as academic researchers. Also given the time elapsed between the tweet and 
this publication it was deemed highly unlikely the Russian authorities would pay any 
attention to an academic English-language publication that has cited a few tweets about the 
London Olympics.  
 
future given that different political and linguistic contexts raise different kinds of ethical 
issues that require different kinds of solutions. What is also certain is that Twitter will also 
continue to transgress public and private boundaries in ways that are unforeseeable.
