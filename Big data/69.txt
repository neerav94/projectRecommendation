Big  data  is  typically  described  by  the  first three 
characteristics. The term big data is believed to have 
originated  with  Web  search  companies  who  had  to 
query  very  large  distributed aggregations  of  loosely-
structured[23] data. 

Big  data  analytics 

requires  capturing  and 
processing data where it resides. This paper explores 
the value of data at the edge of networks, where some 
of  ―biggest‖  big  data  is  generated.  As  the  use  of 
sensors and devices as well as intelligent systems [4] 
[5]  [6]  continues  to  expand,  the  potential  to  gain 
insight  from  the  flood  of  data  from  these  sources 
becomes  a  new  and  compelling  opportunity. 
Businesses that can harness the power of  big data at 
the edge and unlock its value to the organization will 
outperform their competitors with greater capabilities 
to  innovate  creatively  and  solve  complex  problems

analytics  today  focuses  on  managing  and  analyzing 
unstructured  data  from  business  and  social  sources 
such  as  e-mail,  videos,  tweets,  Face  book  posts,

data analytics promises to provide significant value to 
organizations,  data  generated  at  the  edge  of  the

another huge, untapped resource with the potential to 
deliver insights that can transform the operations and 
strategic  initiatives  of  public  and  private  sector 
organizations. 

Data  from  intelligent  systems  and  sensors  is 
some of the largest volume, fastest streaming, and/or

machines, 
connectivity and the growth of sensors and intelligent 
systems  have  opened  up  a  whole  new  storehouse  of 
valuable 
information.  Edge  data  can  provide 
significant value to both the private and public sector 
as a source of enormous potential for gaining deeper, 
richer insight faster and more cost-effectively than in 
the  past.  In  many  cases,  analysis  of  edge  data  can 
help  organizations  respond  to  events  and  solve 
problems that were previously out of reach. 

3.  Implications for Technology 

For data to be analyzed where it resides, compute 
and storage capabilities must be local at the edge and 
in the cloud. This local infrastructure must address a 
set  of  unique  challenges  based  on  characteristics  of 
the data and related issues. 

•   Sensed data is massive and streams 24-7. 
•   Data 

and  dirty 

is  noisy 

and 

requires 

preprocessing. 

•   Data has strong locality characteristics, meaning 
that  the  devices  are  operated  and  consumed 
locally. 

•   Data  ownership,  interoperability,  security,  and 

privacy are big issues. 

How  does  this  translate  into  a  real-life  example? 
Here‘s a transportation and public safety example. 

•   Road 

sensors  may  belong 

to  different 

departments. 

•   Some  cameras  are  owned  by  public  security, 

while others belong to public transportation. 

•   Data is generated on private vehicles. 

The issues: Can the data from these multiple systems 
be  integrated  and  analyzed  for  meaningful  insight? 
Who owns the data generated on private vehicles? Is 
the data secured? 

These  issues  are  well  worth  resolving.  Multiple 
data  stream  scan  unlock  intrinsic  correlations  [4]  [5] 
[16] that can have great significance overall. A recent 
study  in  a  city  in  the  People‘s  Republic  of  China 
(PRC)  shows  that  if  you  can  detect  morning  wash 
time from the water supply subsystem, you can infer

the  morning  rush  hour;  similarly,  if  you  can  detect 
when  offices  are  powered  down  in the  evening,  you 
can infer the evening rush hour. Understanding these 
relationships  can  help  cities  better  handle  traffic  at 
peak  times  as  well  as  improve  availability  of  water 
and electrical resources when they are most needed. 

4.  What’s next? 

Big data is a game changer and it‘s already here. 
While most of the momentum around big data today 
is  around  social  media  sources,  I  believe  that 
realizing the promise of  big data [1][2][21] analytics 
must  include  a  way  to  harness  the  potential  of  big 
data from intelligent systems and sensors. 
 
•   Understand use cases and their implications. We 
must  understand  how  existing  disparate  data 
sources  can  be  evolved  into  a  network  of 
integrated, intelligent, connected systems. 

•   Define  the  usage  model  requirements  for  the 
analytics  of  edge  data.  The  architecture  must 
take 
advantage  of  big  data  distributed 
frameworks  [24]  [27]  to  move  computation 
closer  to  where  the  data resides  and  support  big 
data analytics at the edge via intelligent systems 
and local clouds. 

•   Enable the fast and secure delivery of aggregated 
data  from  edge  analytics  systems  [27]  [28]  to 
other  cloud  and  analytics  platforms  for  further 
analysis. 

•  Address 

issues 

related 

to  data  ownership, 

interoperability, security, and privacy. 

4.1. Take  the  Next  Steps  to  Manage  and  

  Analyze Edge Data 

Here‘s how you can get ready to take advantage 

of this fast moving area for your organization. 

•   Keep  up-to-date  with  what‘s  happening.  For 
example  Intel  offers  practical  guidance  to  help 
you  deploy  big  data  environments  more  quickly 
and with lower risk.  

•   Explore business opportunities deriving from the 
analytics  of  edge  data.  Collaborate  with  the 
business to understand existing edge systems and 
the potential use for data. For more information

the  Hadoop  framework  is  more  cost-  effective  for 
handling  large,  complex,  or  unstructured  data  sets 
than  conventional  approaches,  and  it  offers  massive 
scalability and speed.

2.  Big Data at the Edge 

Much  of  the  current  discussion  about  big  data 
analytics  today  focuses  on  managing  and  analyzing 
unstructured  data  from  business  and  social  sources 
such  as  e-mail,  videos,  tweets,  Face  book  posts, 
reviews,  and  Web  behavior.  While  this  type  of  big 
data analytics promises to provide significant value to 
organizations,  data  generated  at  the  edge  of  the 
network  from  sensors  and  other  devices  represents 
another huge, untapped resource with the potential to 
deliver insights that can transform the operations and 
strategic  initiatives  of  public  and  private  sector 
organizations. 

Data  from  intelligent  systems  and  sensors  is 
some of the largest volume, fastest streaming, and/or 
most  complex  big  data.  The  data  sources  are 
distributed  across  the  network  and  data  is  collected

devices.  Ubiquitous 
machines, 
connectivity and the growth of sensors and intelligent 
systems  have  opened  up  a  whole  new  storehouse  of 
valuable 
information.  Edge  data  can  provide 
significant value to both the private and public sector 
as a source of enormous potential for gaining deeper, 
richer insight faster and more cost-effectively than in 
the  past.  In  many  cases,  analysis  of  edge  data  can 
help  organizations  respond  to  events  and  solve 
problems that were previously out of reach. 

3.  Implications for Technology 

For data to be analyzed where it resides, compute 
and storage capabilities must be local at the edge and 
in the cloud. This local infrastructure must address a 
set  of  unique  challenges  based  on  characteristics  of 
the data and related issues. 

•   Sensed data is massive and streams 24-7. 
•   Data 

and  dirty 

is  noisy 

and 

requires 

preprocessing. 

•   Data has strong locality characteristics, meaning 
that  the  devices  are  operated  and  consumed 
locally. 

•   Data  ownership,  interoperability,  security,  and 

privacy are big issues. 

How  does  this  translate  into  a  real-life  example? 
Here‘s a transportation and public safety example. 

•   Road 

sensors  may  belong 

to  different 

departments. 

•   Some  cameras  are  owned  by  public  security, 

while others belong to public transportation. 

•   Data is generated on private vehicles. 

The issues: Can the data from these multiple systems 
be  integrated  and  analyzed  for  meaningful  insight? 
Who owns the data generated on private vehicles? Is 
the data secured? 

These  issues  are  well  worth  resolving.  Multiple 
data  stream  scan  unlock  intrinsic  correlations  [4]  [5] 
[16] that can have great significance overall. A recent 
study  in  a  city  in  the  People‘s  Republic  of  China 
(PRC)  shows  that  if  you  can  detect  morning  wash 
time from the water supply subsystem, you can infer

the  morning  rush  hour;  similarly,  if  you  can  detect 
when  offices  are  powered  down  in the  evening,  you 
can infer the evening rush hour. Understanding these 
relationships  can  help  cities  better  handle  traffic  at 
peak  times  as  well  as  improve  availability  of  water 
and electrical resources when they are most needed. 

4.  What’s next? 

Big data is a game changer and it‘s already here. 
While most of the momentum around big data today 
is  around  social  media  sources,  I  believe  that 
realizing the promise of  big data [1][2][21] analytics 
must  include  a  way  to  harness  the  potential  of  big 
data from intelligent systems and sensors. 
 
•   Understand use cases and their implications. We 
must  understand  how  existing  disparate  data 
sources  can  be  evolved  into  a  network  of 
integrated, intelligent, connected systems. 

•   Define  the  usage  model  requirements  for  the 
analytics  of  edge  data.  The  architecture  must 
take 
advantage  of  big  data  distributed 
frameworks  [24]  [27]  to  move  computation 
closer  to  where  the  data resides  and  support  big 
data analytics at the edge via intelligent systems 
and local clouds. 

•   Enable the fast and secure delivery of aggregated 
data  from  edge  analytics  systems  [27]  [28]  to 
other  cloud  and  analytics  platforms  for  further 
analysis. 

•  Address 

issues 

related 

to  data  ownership, 

interoperability, security, and privacy. 

4.1. Take  the  Next  Steps  to  Manage  and  

  Analyze Edge Data 

Here‘s how you can get ready to take advantage 

of this fast moving area for your organization. 

•   Keep  up-to-date  with  what‘s  happening.  For 
example  Intel  offers  practical  guidance  to  help 
you  deploy  big  data  environments  more  quickly 
and with lower risk.  

•   Explore business opportunities deriving from the 
analytics  of  edge  data.  Collaborate  with  the 
business to understand existing edge systems and 
the potential use for data. For more information
