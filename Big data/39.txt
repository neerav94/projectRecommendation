Abstract
Modern technologies are capable of generating enormous amounts of data that measure complex biological systems.
Computational biologists and bioinformatics scientists are increasingly being asked to use these data to reveal key systems-
level properties. We review the extent to which curricula are changing in the era of big data. We identify key competencies
that scientists dealing with big data are expected to possess across ﬁelds, and we use this information to propose courses to
meet these growing needs. While bioinformatics programs have traditionally trained students in data-intensive science, we
identify areas of particular biological, computational and statistical emphasis important for this era that can be incorpo-
rated into existing curricula. For each area, we propose a course structured around these topics, which can be adapted in
whole or in parts into existing curricula. In summary, speciﬁc challenges associated with big data provide an important
opportunity to update existing curricula, but we do not foresee a wholesale redesign of bioinformatics training programs.

Key words: big data; bioinformatics; data science; education

Big data challenges
The modern quantitative scientist is awash in a data deluge.
The amount of data being generated far outweighs that being
thoroughly analyzed. For example, Wal-mart stores process
more than 1 million customer transactions per hour, and users
upload >100 h of video content per minute on YouTube [1, 2]. It
is clear that some data are ‘big’ and that such big data come in
many forms and are of great interest to a variety of groups,
from biologists to law enforcement, social services, private
companies and homeland security [3]. There is no consensus on
what constitutes big data [4, 5]. In general, the concept encom-
passes collections that are too large to manage and analyze
using traditional approaches. Under this model, what specific-
ally constitutes big data is a field-specific moving target that
grows as research advances.

The data that meet this definition in biology and medicine
are generated from numerous sources, including laboratory

experiments, medical records and insurance/claims data [6] and
are accessible via online databases such as the ArrayExpress re-
pository [7], the eMERGE network [8] and the SEER-Medicare
database, respectively [9]. Biomedical big data are emerging
from the combination of small data sources as well. For ex-
ample, as scientists share their laboratory experiments with
others in ArrayExpress, this creates a resource containing
>54 000 genome-wide experiments measuring >1.6 million con-
ditions [7]. These aggregate big data are inherently economical
to use, as the cost of data generation is shared over many labs,
and computational methods have been developed to use these
aggregate data [10–14].

Biomedical big data provide the opportunity to develop data-
driven predictions that complement knowledge-based hypoth-
esis generation. Because these data represent multi-investigator
and multi-institution resources, the systems being measured
are diverse and discoveries are expected to be more likely to

generalize [15–17]. Big data present new opportunities, as well
as new challenges. Adapting bioinformatics curricula to address
these challenges will require us to develop curricula that pro-
vide the skills to harness big data and the skepticism to critic-
ally evaluate findings.

The challenges raised by big data that our curricula should
prepare students to address include data unification [18], com-
putational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], multiple hypoth-
esis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the data [6]. Data
unification encompasses the challenges of both data wrangling,
i.e. obtaining the necessary data in the appropriate format, as
well as the normalization necessary to make them comparable
across sources. Computational and storage limitations refer to
the difficulties and costs associated with keeping data, moving
data and analyzing data. Multiple hypothesis testing refers to
the challenge of statistically addressing the likelihood of finding
spurious associations in large data sets. Bias and confounding
in the data refer to challenges related to which experiments
have been performed or which processes are most frequently
assayed. The field is moving rapidly, and the challenges and the
solutions to them are not static. Bioinformatics trainees in the
big data era will need to be able to understand the current com-
puting environment (processor, storage, memory and network
costs) and how to, within that environment, most effectively
analyze and gain insights from large-scale data. We propose up-
dates to curricula to address these key factors.

Investments in big data training and research
Significant resources are being allocated for training scientists
in the analysis of large-scale data. Recent US governmental in-
vestments including the Big Data Initiative [20] and the NIH Big
Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative [21] focus on research and
training related to big data challenges. The Big Data Initiative
specifically aims to ‘greatly improve the tools and techniques
needed to access, organize, and glean discoveries from huge
volumes of digital data’ [20]. The 200 million dollar investment
is divided across six federal departments and agencies and will
fund both student training initiatives as well as research pro-
grams. One component of the BD2K initiative is to train re-
searchers who can harness the power of big data [21]. The
University of Washington recently received a 2.8 million dollar
National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education
and Research Traineeship (IGERT) grant entitled ‘Big Data U’
that aims to train graduate students to use big data in many dif-
ferent fields of research [22]. In the UK, the Medical Research
Council has established a 90 million pound initiative to support
big data challenges [23]. IBM has partnered with the Ministry of
Education and 100 universities in China to promote big data and
analytics training programs through a 100 million dollar invest-
ment [24].

Private foundations have also invested heavily in training
students to transform big data into new discoveries. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
are supporting New York University (NYU), The University of
California, Berkeley, and the University of Washington with a
cross-institutional 5 year 37.8 million dollar initiative to advance
data-driven discovery that will allow ‘university researchers to
harness the full potential of the data-rich world that character-
izes all fields of science and discovery’ [25]. A primary component
of this award is to empower education in data science [25].
The Li Ka Shing Foundation has given funds to promote
big data research at Oxford University and Stanford University
[26, 27].

Significant resources are also being allocated for the analysis
of big data, and trainees of bioinformatics programs that update
their curricula for big data would be ideal competitors for these
grants, such as the BD2K and Big Data initiatives. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation has directly funded academic re-
searchers through their 5 year data-driven discovery grants as
well [28].

Through these large governmental and private investments,
graduate students will have greater access to big data resources
and opportunities to learn from experts in the field, which will
aid in addressing some of the challenges that big data present.
These investments also ensure that students will be properly
trained in extracting rich information found in big data, and
they will fill a pipeline of well-trained scientists capable of
working with big data.

Changes in bioinformatics training programs
and the arrival of new data science programs
over the past 12–18 months
Bioinformatics curricula at
the undergraduate [29–34] and
graduate level [29–33, 35–38] have been reviewed previously,
and here we focus on contributions to the field in graduate edu-
cation in between 2012 and 2014. Margolis et al. [21] state that
constituencies in the ‘biomedical big data ecosystem include
data providers and users (eg, biomedical researchers, clinicians,
and citizens), data scientists, funders, publishers, and libraries’.
To create and maintain this ecosystem, bioinformatics educa-
tion is a critical component. We must train scientists who are
able to work effectively with biomedical big data. Bioinformatics
programs at every degree level exist globally; however, the ex-
tent to which these programs have updated their curricula to
accommodate the rapidly changing environment of bioinfor-
matics training is unknown. The evolving training landscape is
currently driven by the creation of data science centers and
departments that offer degree programs that mirror the compu-
tational science and statistical coursework offered by bioinfor-
matics programs. The primary difference between many
bioinformatics curricula and these new data science programs
is the specific focus on biological problems in bioinformatics
versus a wider array of topics found in data science, from busi-
ness analytics to data security. Data science programs may also
delve more deeply into computational, mathematical and stat-
istical sciences (e.g. required courses in statistical inference,
data visualization, machine learning and data management).
An exciting aspect of data science programs is that they are ex-
tremely transdisciplinary, perhaps more so than traditional bio-
informatics programs, as the data being analyzed span many
disparate fields.

For example, The Center for Data Science at NYU offers a
masters degree in data science and also launched the Moore-
Sloan Data Science Environment which allows scientists in
fields such as biology or astrophysics to collaborate across the
mathematical and computational sciences. Indiana University,
Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University, NYU and
Worcester Polytechnic Institute are just a few of the universities
that have rolled out data science graduate programs; there are
many additional schools that offer certification in data science.
These collaborative data science programs are likely to posi-
tively impact bioinformatics programs, as there should be
cross-talk between them through faculty interactions and
cross-listed courses. This synergistic environment extends be-
yond the confines of single institutions through collaborative

big data grants such as the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation initiative between NYU, UC-
Berkeley and the University of Washington, which focus on
‘championing education and training in data science at all lev-
els’ [25].

Many of these programs are addressing the challenge of
training domain experts in hard analytical skills while simul-
taneously training computational researchers in the necessary
domain knowledge. While there are diverse opinions about how
to update bioinformatics curricula to stay relevant in the era of
big data, one must also remember that enacting those updates
and training at the interface of multiple fields is inherently diffi-
cult. Graduate training in bioinformatics is difficult because it is
a rapidly evolving field, and many new graduate students come
from one field of strength (i.e. computer science or biology), ra-
ther than an interdisciplinary one. Abeln et al. [39] address this
with a fresh perspective on interdisciplinary education. Their
novel MSc program housed between VU University Amsterdam
and the University of Amsterdam allows students to choose a
track in bioinformatics or systems biology [39]. At the start of
their program, the required courses are taken alongside ‘conver-
sion courses’, which aim to bring students up to speed in two of
three areas, wherever they may be lacking expertise (molecular
biology, mathematics and programming). Throughout their pro-
gram, the classes have interdisciplinary projects that reinforce
concepts across the disciplines. Below, we propose additions to
current bioinformatics curricula, and to accommodate the
growing body of knowledge that students need to learn in the
era of big data, these additions may be difficult to fit into al-
ready challenging curricula. However, innovative approaches to
interdisciplinary education, such as the one proposed by Abeln
et al., are one way that programs may adapt their curricula to
train students more broadly in the big data deluge.

Additions to existing curricula
An important question to consider now is whether current bio-
informatics training programs are adjusting their curricula to
incorporate big data challenges. Individuals with the ability
to analyze, organize and foster discoveries from immense
volumes of data are valuable in today’s economy and will be-
come more so in the future. According to a report filed by
McKinsey and Company where they studied the economic im-
pact of big data on different economic sectors, there will be a
potential shortfall of 140 000–190 000 people for positions requir-
ing ‘deep analytical skills’ by 2018 [4]. Many bioinformatics pro-
grams were established before big data became a prominent
area of focus. These programs may need to refresh some as-
pects of their curriculum to stay competitive among other
programs and to remain competitive for funding sources. While
many aspects of data science curricula now represent import-
ant areas of bioinformatics,
the modern bioinformatics
researcher should have extensive knowledge of biology, which
is likely to extend beyond that covered in existing data science
curricula. Bioinformatics students in general benefit
from
an interdisciplinary training program that trains broadly in
computer
statistics, bioinformatics and biology.
Bioinformatics curricula updates should address data unifica-
tion [18], computational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], mul-
tiple hypothesis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the
data [6].

Below we include suggested courses on ‘The Flow of
Biological Information’, ‘Statistical Challenges of Big Data’ and
‘Computational Challenges of Big Data’. These hypothetical
courses highlight some of the most necessary biology, computa-
tional and statistical knowledge needed by the next generation
of bioinformaticists for the era of big data and provide a frame-
work for the redesign of program curricula. While we suggest
these as courses that may be added to existing curricula, these
skills may also be acquired through required coursework, elect-
ives,
journal clubs and online resources. These suggested
courses include topic areas that should be covered in a bioinfor-
matics curriculum, but more work is needed to implement and
assess the impact of training program updates. As noted in
Magana et al. [40], while the bioinformatics community has
broadly implemented curricula, little is known about the effect-
iveness of these curricula on learning objectives. As with any
graduate curriculum,
it should be tailored to the student’s
strengths and deficiencies to enable the greatest chance for
success.

To remain at the forefront of bioinformatics education, cur-
ricula should be updated on an annual or biennial basis. Course
instructors should adjust curricula as necessary based on ad-
vancements in the field. They should also engage with current
students in their classes to assess class activity and topic use-
fulness, obtain class evaluations during and after the class
ends, as well as stay in contact with class/program alumni to
discuss the impact of the class on their success after graduation
[41]. Additionally, it is helpful in an interdisciplinary program
like bioinformatics to have regular faculty meetings across the
disciplines in the core curricula to communicate how the pro-
gram curricula should evolve as a whole based on advance-
ments in their respective fields.

Abstract
Modern technologies are capable of generating enormous amounts of data that measure complex biological systems.
Computational biologists and bioinformatics scientists are increasingly being asked to use these data to reveal key systems-
level properties. We review the extent to which curricula are changing in the era of big data. We identify key competencies
that scientists dealing with big data are expected to possess across ﬁelds, and we use this information to propose courses to
meet these growing needs. While bioinformatics programs have traditionally trained students in data-intensive science, we
identify areas of particular biological, computational and statistical emphasis important for this era that can be incorpo-
rated into existing curricula. For each area, we propose a course structured around these topics, which can be adapted in
whole or in parts into existing curricula. In summary, speciﬁc challenges associated with big data provide an important
opportunity to update existing curricula, but we do not foresee a wholesale redesign of bioinformatics training programs.

Big data challenges
The modern quantitative scientist is awash in a data deluge.
The amount of data being generated far outweighs that being
thoroughly analyzed. For example, Wal-mart stores process
more than 1 million customer transactions per hour, and users
upload >100 h of video content per minute on YouTube [1, 2]. It
is clear that some data are ‘big’ and that such big data come in
many forms and are of great interest to a variety of groups,
from biologists to law enforcement, social services, private
companies and homeland security [3]. There is no consensus on
what constitutes big data [4, 5]. In general, the concept encom-
passes collections that are too large to manage and analyze
using traditional approaches. Under this model, what specific-
ally constitutes big data is a field-specific moving target that
grows as research advances.

The data that meet this definition in biology and medicine
are generated from numerous sources, including laboratory

experiments, medical records and insurance/claims data [6] and
are accessible via online databases such as the ArrayExpress re-
pository [7], the eMERGE network [8] and the SEER-Medicare
database, respectively [9]. Biomedical big data are emerging
from the combination of small data sources as well. For ex-
ample, as scientists share their laboratory experiments with
others in ArrayExpress, this creates a resource containing
>54 000 genome-wide experiments measuring >1.6 million con-
ditions [7]. These aggregate big data are inherently economical
to use, as the cost of data generation is shared over many labs,
and computational methods have been developed to use these
aggregate data [10–14].

Biomedical big data provide the opportunity to develop data-
driven predictions that complement knowledge-based hypoth-
esis generation. Because these data represent multi-investigator
and multi-institution resources, the systems being measured
are diverse and discoveries are expected to be more likely to

generalize [15–17]. Big data present new opportunities, as well
as new challenges. Adapting bioinformatics curricula to address
these challenges will require us to develop curricula that pro-
vide the skills to harness big data and the skepticism to critic-
ally evaluate findings.

The challenges raised by big data that our curricula should
prepare students to address include data unification [18], com-
putational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], multiple hypoth-
esis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the data [6]. Data
unification encompasses the challenges of both data wrangling,
i.e. obtaining the necessary data in the appropriate format, as
well as the normalization necessary to make them comparable
across sources. Computational and storage limitations refer to
the difficulties and costs associated with keeping data, moving
data and analyzing data. Multiple hypothesis testing refers to
the challenge of statistically addressing the likelihood of finding
spurious associations in large data sets. Bias and confounding
in the data refer to challenges related to which experiments
have been performed or which processes are most frequently
assayed. The field is moving rapidly, and the challenges and the
solutions to them are not static. Bioinformatics trainees in the
big data era will need to be able to understand the current com-
puting environment (processor, storage, memory and network
costs) and how to, within that environment, most effectively
analyze and gain insights from large-scale data. We propose up-
dates to curricula to address these key factors.

Investments in big data training and research
Significant resources are being allocated for training scientists
in the analysis of large-scale data. Recent US governmental in-
vestments including the Big Data Initiative [20] and the NIH Big
Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative [21] focus on research and
training related to big data challenges. The Big Data Initiative
specifically aims to ‘greatly improve the tools and techniques
needed to access, organize, and glean discoveries from huge
volumes of digital data’ [20]. The 200 million dollar investment
is divided across six federal departments and agencies and will
fund both student training initiatives as well as research pro-
grams. One component of the BD2K initiative is to train re-
searchers who can harness the power of big data [21]. The
University of Washington recently received a 2.8 million dollar
National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education
and Research Traineeship (IGERT) grant entitled ‘Big Data U’
that aims to train graduate students to use big data in many dif-
ferent fields of research [22]. In the UK, the Medical Research
Council has established a 90 million pound initiative to support
big data challenges [23]. IBM has partnered with the Ministry of
Education and 100 universities in China to promote big data and
analytics training programs through a 100 million dollar invest-
ment [24].

Private foundations have also invested heavily in training
students to transform big data into new discoveries. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
are supporting New York University (NYU), The University of
California, Berkeley, and the University of Washington with a
cross-institutional 5 year 37.8 million dollar initiative to advance
data-driven discovery that will allow ‘university researchers to
harness the full potential of the data-rich world that character-
izes all fields of science and discovery’ [25]. A primary component
of this award is to empower education in data science [25].
The Li Ka Shing Foundation has given funds to promote
big data research at Oxford University and Stanford University
[26, 27].

Significant resources are also being allocated for the analysis
of big data, and trainees of bioinformatics programs that update
their curricula for big data would be ideal competitors for these
grants, such as the BD2K and Big Data initiatives. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation has directly funded academic re-
searchers through their 5 year data-driven discovery grants as
well [28].

Through these large governmental and private investments,
graduate students will have greater access to big data resources
and opportunities to learn from experts in the field, which will
aid in addressing some of the challenges that big data present.
These investments also ensure that students will be properly
trained in extracting rich information found in big data, and
they will fill a pipeline of well-trained scientists capable of
working with big data.

Changes in bioinformatics training programs
and the arrival of new data science programs
over the past 12–18 months
Bioinformatics curricula at
the undergraduate [29–34] and
graduate level [29–33, 35–38] have been reviewed previously,
and here we focus on contributions to the field in graduate edu-
cation in between 2012 and 2014. Margolis et al. [21] state that
constituencies in the ‘biomedical big data ecosystem include
data providers and users (eg, biomedical researchers, clinicians,
and citizens), data scientists, funders, publishers, and libraries’.
To create and maintain this ecosystem, bioinformatics educa-
tion is a critical component. We must train scientists who are
able to work effectively with biomedical big data. Bioinformatics
programs at every degree level exist globally; however, the ex-
tent to which these programs have updated their curricula to
accommodate the rapidly changing environment of bioinfor-
matics training is unknown. The evolving training landscape is
currently driven by the creation of data science centers and
departments that offer degree programs that mirror the compu-
tational science and statistical coursework offered by bioinfor-
matics programs. The primary difference between many
bioinformatics curricula and these new data science programs
is the specific focus on biological problems in bioinformatics
versus a wider array of topics found in data science, from busi-
ness analytics to data security. Data science programs may also
delve more deeply into computational, mathematical and stat-
istical sciences (e.g. required courses in statistical inference,
data visualization, machine learning and data management).
An exciting aspect of data science programs is that they are ex-
tremely transdisciplinary, perhaps more so than traditional bio-
informatics programs, as the data being analyzed span many
disparate fields.

For example, The Center for Data Science at NYU offers a
masters degree in data science and also launched the Moore-
Sloan Data Science Environment which allows scientists in
fields such as biology or astrophysics to collaborate across the
mathematical and computational sciences. Indiana University,
Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University, NYU and
Worcester Polytechnic Institute are just a few of the universities
that have rolled out data science graduate programs; there are
many additional schools that offer certification in data science.
These collaborative data science programs are likely to posi-
tively impact bioinformatics programs, as there should be
cross-talk between them through faculty interactions and
cross-listed courses. This synergistic environment extends be-
yond the confines of single institutions through collaborative

big data grants such as the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation initiative between NYU, UC-
Berkeley and the University of Washington, which focus on
‘championing education and training in data science at all lev-
els’ [25].

Many of these programs are addressing the challenge of
training domain experts in hard analytical skills while simul-
taneously training computational researchers in the necessary
domain knowledge. While there are diverse opinions about how
to update bioinformatics curricula to stay relevant in the era of
big data, one must also remember that enacting those updates
and training at the interface of multiple fields is inherently diffi-
cult. Graduate training in bioinformatics is difficult because it is
a rapidly evolving field, and many new graduate students come
from one field of strength (i.e. computer science or biology), ra-
ther than an interdisciplinary one. Abeln et al. [39] address this
with a fresh perspective on interdisciplinary education. Their
novel MSc program housed between VU University Amsterdam
and the University of Amsterdam allows students to choose a
track in bioinformatics or systems biology [39]. At the start of
their program, the required courses are taken alongside ‘conver-
sion courses’, which aim to bring students up to speed in two of
three areas, wherever they may be lacking expertise (molecular
biology, mathematics and programming). Throughout their pro-
gram, the classes have interdisciplinary projects that reinforce
concepts across the disciplines. Below, we propose additions to
current bioinformatics curricula, and to accommodate the
growing body of knowledge that students need to learn in the
era of big data, these additions may be difficult to fit into al-
ready challenging curricula. However, innovative approaches to
interdisciplinary education, such as the one proposed by Abeln
et al., are one way that programs may adapt their curricula to
train students more broadly in the big data deluge.

Additions to existing curricula
An important question to consider now is whether current bio-
informatics training programs are adjusting their curricula to
incorporate big data challenges. Individuals with the ability
to analyze, organize and foster discoveries from immense
volumes of data are valuable in today’s economy and will be-
come more so in the future. According to a report filed by
McKinsey and Company where they studied the economic im-
pact of big data on different economic sectors, there will be a
potential shortfall of 140 000–190 000 people for positions requir-
ing ‘deep analytical skills’ by 2018 [4]. Many bioinformatics pro-
grams were established before big data became a prominent
area of focus. These programs may need to refresh some as-
pects of their curriculum to stay competitive among other
programs and to remain competitive for funding sources. While

informatics methods not available to those who treat data as a
“given”’. In addition to developing an understanding of the
underlying experimental platforms, this course will familiarize
students with the data formats and skills necessary for data
wrangling in this domain [43].

Each week covers an important type of biology information
storage and processing. The conceptual lectures are paired with
a lab in which the students analyze data relevant to the week’s
lecture using recently developed methods. During lectures
focused on each type of information, students will be exposed
to the types of data that are commonly used to measure these
systems. To effectively carry out these labs, students should
have a strong programming background when coming into the
course. A common theme throughout the course should be the
data and knowledge biases associated with each type of
information.

The course is organized around key types of information
transfer, organized into three modules. The first module is
Transmission Between Generations (heredity, molecular gen-
etics—mitosis/meiosis, epigenetics) with lectures in DNA (struc-
ture and DNA as an information storage medium), mitosis (how
genomes are copied, errors that can arise), meiosis (genetic vari-
ation at the population level) and epigenetics (inheritance can
occur beyond the level of nucleic acid sequence). Example labs
relating to these lecture topics include aligning reads to a gen-
ome (e.g. Bowtie [44]), identification of somatic variations in
cancer (e.g. apply MuTect [45]), 1000 genomes/variant annota-
tions (e.g. [46]) and bisulfite sequencing alignment (e.g. [47]).
The second module covers Transmission Within the Cell [epi-
genetics, transcriptional regulation (mRNA, miRNA and siRNA)
and translational regulation (protein, phosphorylation)] and has
lectures on epigenetics (epigenetic marks as a means to define
cell-lineages), regulation of transcription (transcription factor
binding, motifs, ChIP-seq), steady-state mRNA levels (how
genes are expressed to mRNA), noncoding RNA (RNAi, miRNA,
siRNA, lncRNA and their role in regulation) and proteomics
(translational and posttranslational regulation). The last mod-
ule is Transmission Between Cells [instant messaging (small
molecule signaling), recognition of nonself (immunology) and

talking with others (quorum sensing)] and discusses small mol-
ecule signaling (neurotransmitters, etc), recognition of nonself
and quorum sensing. The course is capped by a student-defined
final project through which they integrate two or more data
types covered within the course.

Suggested additional course: Statistical
Challenges of Big Data
For example, the uncertainty around results represents an im-
portant and fast-moving area. In an interview about the chal-
lenges of big data, Michael I. Jordon from the University of
California, Berkeley, states, ‘We have to have error bars around
all our predictions. That is something that’s missing in much of
the current machine learning literature’ [48]. He likens this to
bridge building: ‘If I have no principles, and I build thousands
of bridges without any actual science, lots of them will fall
down, and great disasters will occur’ [48]. He states that predic-
tion error bars will take years of research, highlighting one rea-
son why bioinformatics education in big data analysis is
important and will require curricula to be updated as the field
evolves.

Analyzing big data presents additional statistical challenges.
In such data, even infrequent observations are expected to be
frequent. As The Whitlams’ song Up Against the Wall notes,
‘She was one in a million, yeah; So there’s five more, just in
New South Wales’ [49]. In a data set with a trillion observations,
we expect 1000 ‘one in a billion’ events. Experiments to evaluate
results from the analysis of big data need to take this into
account.

This course is organized around principles of experimental
design, hypothesis testing and machine learning and is paired
each week with an associated lab that reinforces the concepts
learned during the week’s lectures (Figure 2). This course would
include motivating examples from recent literature and would
use data sets for data types covered in the transmission of infor-
mation course. A strong emphasis would be placed on the crit-
ical evaluation of potential discoveries, with specific training

more than 1 million customer transactions per hour, and users
upload >100 h of video content per minute on YouTube [1, 2]. It
is clear that some data are ‘big’ and that such big data come in
many forms and are of great interest to a variety of groups,
from biologists to law enforcement, social services, private
companies and homeland security [3]. There is no consensus on
what constitutes big data [4, 5]. In general, the concept encom-
passes collections that are too large to manage and analyze
using traditional approaches. Under this model, what specific-
ally constitutes big data is a field-specific moving target that
grows as research advances.

The data that meet this definition in biology and medicine
are generated from numerous sources, including laboratory

experiments, medical records and insurance/claims data [6] and
are accessible via online databases such as the ArrayExpress re-
pository [7], the eMERGE network [8] and the SEER-Medicare
database, respectively [9]. Biomedical big data are emerging
from the combination of small data sources as well. For ex-
ample, as scientists share their laboratory experiments with
others in ArrayExpress, this creates a resource containing
>54 000 genome-wide experiments measuring >1.6 million con-
ditions [7]. These aggregate big data are inherently economical
to use, as the cost of data generation is shared over many labs,
and computational methods have been developed to use these
aggregate data [10–14].

Biomedical big data provide the opportunity to develop data-
driven predictions that complement knowledge-based hypoth-
esis generation. Because these data represent multi-investigator
and multi-institution resources, the systems being measured
are diverse and discoveries are expected to be more likely to

generalize [15–17]. Big data present new opportunities, as well
as new challenges. Adapting bioinformatics curricula to address
these challenges will require us to develop curricula that pro-
vide the skills to harness big data and the skepticism to critic-
ally evaluate findings.

The challenges raised by big data that our curricula should
prepare students to address include data unification [18], com-
putational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], multiple hypoth-
esis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the data [6]. Data
unification encompasses the challenges of both data wrangling,
i.e. obtaining the necessary data in the appropriate format, as
well as the normalization necessary to make them comparable
across sources. Computational and storage limitations refer to
the difficulties and costs associated with keeping data, moving
data and analyzing data. Multiple hypothesis testing refers to
the challenge of statistically addressing the likelihood of finding
spurious associations in large data sets. Bias and confounding
in the data refer to challenges related to which experiments
have been performed or which processes are most frequently
assayed. The field is moving rapidly, and the challenges and the
solutions to them are not static. Bioinformatics trainees in the
big data era will need to be able to understand the current com-
puting environment (processor, storage, memory and network
costs) and how to, within that environment, most effectively
analyze and gain insights from large-scale data. We propose up-
dates to curricula to address these key factors.

Investments in big data training and research
Significant resources are being allocated for training scientists
in the analysis of large-scale data. Recent US governmental in-
vestments including the Big Data Initiative [20] and the NIH Big
Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative [21] focus on research and
training related to big data challenges. The Big Data Initiative
specifically aims to ‘greatly improve the tools and techniques
needed to access, organize, and glean discoveries from huge
volumes of digital data’ [20]. The 200 million dollar investment
is divided across six federal departments and agencies and will
fund both student training initiatives as well as research pro-
grams. One component of the BD2K initiative is to train re-
searchers who can harness the power of big data [21]. The
University of Washington recently received a 2.8 million dollar
National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education
and Research Traineeship (IGERT) grant entitled ‘Big Data U’
that aims to train graduate students to use big data in many dif-
ferent fields of research [22]. In the UK, the Medical Research
Council has established a 90 million pound initiative to support
big data challenges [23]. IBM has partnered with the Ministry of
Education and 100 universities in China to promote big data and
analytics training programs through a 100 million dollar invest-
ment [24].

Private foundations have also invested heavily in training
students to transform big data into new discoveries. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
are supporting New York University (NYU), The University of
California, Berkeley, and the University of Washington with a
cross-institutional 5 year 37.8 million dollar initiative to advance
data-driven discovery that will allow ‘university researchers to
harness the full potential of the data-rich world that character-
izes all fields of science and discovery’ [25]. A primary component
of this award is to empower education in data science [25].
The Li Ka Shing Foundation has given funds to promote
big data research at Oxford University and Stanford University
[26, 27].

Significant resources are also being allocated for the analysis
of big data, and trainees of bioinformatics programs that update
their curricula for big data would be ideal competitors for these
grants, such as the BD2K and Big Data initiatives. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation has directly funded academic re-
searchers through their 5 year data-driven discovery grants as
well [28].

Through these large governmental and private investments,
graduate students will have greater access to big data resources
and opportunities to learn from experts in the field, which will
aid in addressing some of the challenges that big data present.
These investments also ensure that students will be properly
trained in extracting rich information found in big data, and
they will fill a pipeline of well-trained scientists capable of
working with big data.

Changes in bioinformatics training programs
and the arrival of new data science programs
over the past 12–18 months
Bioinformatics curricula at
the undergraduate [29–34] and
graduate level [29–33, 35–38] have been reviewed previously,
and here we focus on contributions to the field in graduate edu-
cation in between 2012 and 2014. Margolis et al. [21] state that
constituencies in the ‘biomedical big data ecosystem include
data providers and users (eg, biomedical researchers, clinicians,
and citizens), data scientists, funders, publishers, and libraries’.
To create and maintain this ecosystem, bioinformatics educa-
tion is a critical component. We must train scientists who are
able to work effectively with biomedical big data. Bioinformatics
programs at every degree level exist globally; however, the ex-
tent to which these programs have updated their curricula to
accommodate the rapidly changing environment of bioinfor-
matics training is unknown. The evolving training landscape is
currently driven by the creation of data science centers and
departments that offer degree programs that mirror the compu-
tational science and statistical coursework offered by bioinfor-
matics programs. The primary difference between many
bioinformatics curricula and these new data science programs
is the specific focus on biological problems in bioinformatics
versus a wider array of topics found in data science, from busi-
ness analytics to data security. Data science programs may also
delve more deeply into computational, mathematical and stat-
istical sciences (e.g. required courses in statistical inference,
data visualization, machine learning and data management).
An exciting aspect of data science programs is that they are ex-
tremely transdisciplinary, perhaps more so than traditional bio-
informatics programs, as the data being analyzed span many
disparate fields.

For example, The Center for Data Science at NYU offers a
masters degree in data science and also launched the Moore-
Sloan Data Science Environment which allows scientists in
fields such as biology or astrophysics to collaborate across the
mathematical and computational sciences. Indiana University,
Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University, NYU and
Worcester Polytechnic Institute are just a few of the universities
that have rolled out data science graduate programs; there are
many additional schools that offer certification in data science.
These collaborative data science programs are likely to posi-
tively impact bioinformatics programs, as there should be
cross-talk between them through faculty interactions and
cross-listed courses. This synergistic environment extends be-
yond the confines of single institutions through collaborative

big data grants such as the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation initiative between NYU, UC-
Berkeley and the University of Washington, which focus on
‘championing education and training in data science at all lev-
els’ [25].

Many of these programs are addressing the challenge of
training domain experts in hard analytical skills while simul-
taneously training computational researchers in the necessary
domain knowledge. While there are diverse opinions about how
to update bioinformatics curricula to stay relevant in the era of
big data, one must also remember that enacting those updates
and training at the interface of multiple fields is inherently diffi-
cult. Graduate training in bioinformatics is difficult because it is
a rapidly evolving field, and many new graduate students come
from one field of strength (i.e. computer science or biology), ra-
ther than an interdisciplinary one. Abeln et al. [39] address this
with a fresh perspective on interdisciplinary education. Their
novel MSc program housed between VU University Amsterdam
and the University of Amsterdam allows students to choose a
track in bioinformatics or systems biology [39]. At the start of
their program, the required courses are taken alongside ‘conver-
sion courses’, which aim to bring students up to speed in two of
three areas, wherever they may be lacking expertise (molecular
biology, mathematics and programming). Throughout their pro-
gram, the classes have interdisciplinary projects that reinforce
concepts across the disciplines. Below, we propose additions to
current bioinformatics curricula, and to accommodate the
growing body of knowledge that students need to learn in the
era of big data, these additions may be difficult to fit into al-
ready challenging curricula. However, innovative approaches to
interdisciplinary education, such as the one proposed by Abeln
et al., are one way that programs may adapt their curricula to
train students more broadly in the big data deluge.

Additions to existing curricula
An important question to consider now is whether current bio-
informatics training programs are adjusting their curricula to
incorporate big data challenges. Individuals with the ability
to analyze, organize and foster discoveries from immense
volumes of data are valuable in today’s economy and will be-
come more so in the future. According to a report filed by
McKinsey and Company where they studied the economic im-
pact of big data on different economic sectors, there will be a
potential shortfall of 140 000–190 000 people for positions requir-
ing ‘deep analytical skills’ by 2018 [4]. Many bioinformatics pro-
grams were established before big data became a prominent
area of focus. These programs may need to refresh some as-
pects of their curriculum to stay competitive among other
programs and to remain competitive for funding sources. While
many aspects of data science curricula now represent import-
ant areas of bioinformatics,
the modern bioinformatics
researcher should have extensive knowledge of biology, which
is likely to extend beyond that covered in existing data science
curricula. Bioinformatics students in general benefit
from
an interdisciplinary training program that trains broadly in
computer
statistics, bioinformatics and biology.
Bioinformatics curricula updates should address data unifica-
tion [18], computational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], mul-
tiple hypothesis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the
data [6].

Bioinformatics curricula have generally focused on teaching
students how to develop computationally efficient solutions to
pressing biological challenges. We are now seeing a shift from

data-driven discovery solutions (e.g.
Below we include suggested courses on ‘The Flow of
Biological Information’, ‘Statistical Challenges of Big Data’ and
‘Computational Challenges of Big Data’. These hypothetical
courses highlight some of the most necessary biology, computa-
tional and statistical knowledge needed by the next generation
of bioinformaticists for the era of big data and provide a frame-
work for the redesign of program curricula. While we suggest
these as courses that may be added to existing curricula, these
skills may also be acquired through required coursework, elect-
ives,
journal clubs and online resources. These suggested
courses include topic areas that should be covered in a bioinfor-
matics curriculum, but more work is needed to implement and
assess the impact of training program updates. As noted in
Magana et al. [40], while the bioinformatics community has
broadly implemented curricula, little is known about the effect-
iveness of these curricula on learning objectives. As with any
graduate curriculum,
it should be tailored to the student’s
strengths and deficiencies to enable the greatest chance for
success.

To remain at the forefront of bioinformatics education, cur-
ricula should be updated on an annual or biennial basis. Course
instructors should adjust curricula as necessary based on ad-
vancements in the field. They should also engage with current
students in their classes to assess class activity and topic use-
fulness, obtain class evaluations during and after the class
ends, as well as stay in contact with class/program alumni to
discuss the impact of the class on their success after graduation
[41]. Additionally, it is helpful in an interdisciplinary program
like bioinformatics to have regular faculty meetings across the
disciplines in the core curricula to communicate how the pro-
gram curricula should evolve as a whole based on advance-
ments in their respective fields.

curricula.

Suggested additional course: The Flow of
Biological Information
While a broad overview of molecular biology is most thoroughly
accomplished through a series of graduate courses in biology, it
is not always feasible to incorporate a lengthy course series into
existing
Stanford
University, in 1998, published five areas of competence for bio-
informatics training: biology, computer science, statistics, eth-
ics and core bioinformatics [35].
In a recent update [42],
Professor Altman said, ‘For biomedicine, there is little doubt
that the best data scientists will be those who understand the
special features and challenges in biology or medicine, and thus
make assumptions and approximations that are valid and not
fatal’.

Professor Russ Altman of

The large-scale data being generated in biology measure
genome sequences, gene expression, protein signaling and
other areas of information flow through complex biological sys-
tems. We describe a blended molecular biology and genetics
course entitled ‘The Flow of Biological Information’, which
would serve as a primer on the areas of biology that are fre-
quently encountered by bioinformatics students (Figure 1). This
course is intended to provide students with an understanding
of the measurements behind their data. Professor Lawrence
Hunter from the University of Colorado Denver emphasized the
importance of this knowledge when he said [42], ‘Insights into
the idiosyncrasies of instruments such as mass spectrometers
and hybridization arrays have led to dramatic improvements in

informatics methods not available to those who treat data as a
“given”’. In addition to developing an understanding of the
underlying experimental platforms, this course will familiarize
students with the data formats and skills necessary for data
wrangling in this domain [43].

Each week covers an important type of biology information
storage and processing. The conceptual lectures are paired with
a lab in which the students analyze data relevant to the week’s
lecture using recently developed methods. During lectures
focused on each type of information, students will be exposed
to the types of data that are commonly used to measure these
systems. To effectively carry out these labs, students should
have a strong programming background when coming into the
course. A common theme throughout the course should be the
data and knowledge biases associated with each type of
information.

The course is organized around key types of information
transfer, organized into three modules. The first module is
Transmission Between Generations (heredity, molecular gen-
etics—mitosis/meiosis, epigenetics) with lectures in DNA (struc-
ture and DNA as an information storage medium), mitosis (how
genomes are copied, errors that can arise), meiosis (genetic vari-
ation at the population level) and epigenetics (inheritance can
occur beyond the level of nucleic acid sequence). Example labs
relating to these lecture topics include aligning reads to a gen-
ome (e.g. Bowtie [44]), identification of somatic variations in
cancer (e.g. apply MuTect [45]), 1000 genomes/variant annota-
tions (e.g. [46]) and bisulfite sequencing alignment (e.g. [47]).
The second module covers Transmission Within the Cell [epi-
genetics, transcriptional regulation (mRNA, miRNA and siRNA)
and translational regulation (protein, phosphorylation)] and has
lectures on epigenetics (epigenetic marks as a means to define
cell-lineages), regulation of transcription (transcription factor
binding, motifs, ChIP-seq), steady-state mRNA levels (how
genes are expressed to mRNA), noncoding RNA (RNAi, miRNA,
siRNA, lncRNA and their role in regulation) and proteomics
(translational and posttranslational regulation). The last mod-
ule is Transmission Between Cells [instant messaging (small
molecule signaling), recognition of nonself (immunology) and

talking with others (quorum sensing)] and discusses small mol-
ecule signaling (neurotransmitters, etc), recognition of nonself
and quorum sensing. The course is capped by a student-defined
final project through which they integrate two or more data
types covered within the course.

Suggested additional course: Statistical
Challenges of Big Data
For example, the uncertainty around results represents an im-
portant and fast-moving area. In an interview about the chal-
lenges of big data, Michael I. Jordon from the University of
California, Berkeley, states, ‘We have to have error bars around
all our predictions. That is something that’s missing in much of
the current machine learning literature’ [48]. He likens this to
bridge building: ‘If I have no principles, and I build thousands
of bridges without any actual science, lots of them will fall
down, and great disasters will occur’ [48]. He states that predic-
tion error bars will take years of research, highlighting one rea-
son why bioinformatics education in big data analysis is
important and will require curricula to be updated as the field
evolves.

Analyzing big data presents additional statistical challenges.
In such data, even infrequent observations are expected to be
frequent. As The Whitlams’ song Up Against the Wall notes,
‘She was one in a million, yeah; So there’s five more, just in
New South Wales’ [49]. In a data set with a trillion observations,
we expect 1000 ‘one in a billion’ events. Experiments to evaluate
results from the analysis of big data need to take this into
account.

This course is organized around principles of experimental
design, hypothesis testing and machine learning and is paired
each week with an associated lab that reinforces the concepts
learned during the week’s lectures (Figure 2). This course would
include motivating examples from recent literature and would
use data sets for data types covered in the transmission of infor-
mation course. A strong emphasis would be placed on the crit-
ical evaluation of potential discoveries, with specific training

toward recognizing knowledge or data biases that could lead to
spurious discoveries.

The first key module is Experimental Design (parameter op-
timization, blinded evaluations, independence) and has lectures
on hyperparameter optimization (parameter sweep), method
evaluation (permutation testing, blinded evaluations) and key
assumptions of methods (independence, naı¨ve Bayes). Example
labs for these lectures include a parameter sweep for an appro-
priate ‘c’ using support vector machines (SVM), evaluation to
see if this SVM works better than random and using a naı¨ve
Bayes classifier to combine simulated data with nonindepend-
ence and/or random data (which is worse?). The second module
is based on Hypothesis Testing (parametric, nonparametric,
multiple testing) and features lecture topics on parametric stat-
istical methods, nonparametric statistics and multiple hypoth-
esis testing (good and bad uses, Type I and II error). The last
module focuses on machine learning (data-driven model con-
struction, regularization), with lectures on unsupervised meth-
ods (clustering, PCA), supervised methods (regression and
classification), semi-supervised methods (classification), regu-
larization (lasso, ridge, elastic net) and artificial intelligence.
The conclusion of the course is focused on a student project to
use all of the knowledge gained from the course to analyze a
new data set, extract novel insights and analyze the validity of
the results.

Suggested additional course: Computational
Challenges of Big Data
Analyzing big data present new computational challenges.
These data may need to be analyzed in a distributed manner,
the analyses performed should be highly reproducible to allow
for thorough evaluation of potential biases, and results need to
be presented as effective visual summaries. Our proposed
course touches on each of these areas (Figure 3).

To address the challenge of feasibility, we introduce stu-
dents to cloud computing. Vasant Dhar, Professor and Director
of the Center for Business Analytics at NYU’s Stern School of
Business, recently highlighted cloud computing and distributed
computing as necessary components of a data science educa-
tion [50]. To address reproducibility, we introduce workflow
automation, version control and unit testing [51–53]. For visual-
ization, we use the modern javascript library, d3.js, to teach
students to make high-content visualizations of complex data
sets.

While each of these topics is large enough to be covered in
an individual course, the emphasis of this course is on provid-
ing students with the groundwork necessary to identify the ap-
propriate courses and focus areas for a given challenge. The
laboratory components of this course would be conducted en-
tirely using cloud computing resources (e.g. through Amazon’s
EC2). This would provide students with efficient solutions for
multiple types of data, expertise in managing a cloud comput-
ing system and an important background in conveying results
to a broader audience.

The first module is Feasibility (distributed problem solving
and cloud computing) with lectures in cloud computing (what
is it, how to use it and cost drivers) and distributed problem-
solving. Example labs include creating a cloud instance and
performing an analysis, implementing a parameter sweep/em-
barrassingly parallel process and read mapping across many
reads or building a model with many examples. The second
module focuses on Reproducibility (shell scripting, workflow
automation and unit testing) and contains lectures on workflow
automation in biology (make, galaxy, etc), version control (git,
github, mercurial and bitbucket) and unit testing (unit test
library for a programming language of choice). The last module
is Visual Analytics (building meaningful visualizations, testing
visualizations), including topics on D3 visualization, making
visualizations useful and unit testing for javascript. The course
is capped by a project in which the students integrate what

Abstract
Modern technologies are capable of generating enormous amounts of data that measure complex biological systems.
Computational biologists and bioinformatics scientists are increasingly being asked to use these data to reveal key systems-
level properties. We review the extent to which curricula are changing in the era of big data. We identify key competencies
that scientists dealing with big data are expected to possess across ﬁelds, and we use this information to propose courses to
meet these growing needs. While bioinformatics programs have traditionally trained students in data-intensive science, we
identify areas of particular biological, computational and statistical emphasis important for this era that can be incorpo-
rated into existing curricula. For each area, we propose a course structured around these topics, which can be adapted in
whole or in parts into existing curricula. In summary, speciﬁc challenges associated with big data provide an important
opportunity to update existing curricula, but we do not foresee a wholesale redesign of bioinformatics training programs.

Key words: big data; bioinformatics; data science; education

Big data challenges
The modern quantitative scientist is awash in a data deluge.
The amount of data being generated far outweighs that being
thoroughly analyzed. For example, Wal-mart stores process
more than 1 million customer transactions per hour, and users
upload >100 h of video content per minute on YouTube [1, 2]. It
is clear that some data are ‘big’ and that such big data come in
many forms and are of great interest to a variety of groups,
from biologists to law enforcement, social services, private
companies and homeland security [3]. There is no consensus on
what constitutes big data [4, 5]. In general, the concept encom-
passes collections that are too large to manage and analyze
using traditional approaches. Under this model, what specific-
ally constitutes big data is a field-specific moving target that
grows as research advances.

The data that meet this definition in biology and medicine
are generated from numerous sources, including laboratory

experiments, medical records and insurance/claims data [6] and
are accessible via online databases such as the ArrayExpress re-
pository [7], the eMERGE network [8] and the SEER-Medicare
database, respectively [9]. Biomedical big data are emerging
from the combination of small data sources as well. For ex-
ample, as scientists share their laboratory experiments with
others in ArrayExpress, this creates a resource containing
>54 000 genome-wide experiments measuring >1.6 million con-
ditions [7]. These aggregate big data are inherently economical
to use, as the cost of data generation is shared over many labs,
and computational methods have been developed to use these
aggregate data [10–14].

Biomedical big data provide the opportunity to develop data-
driven predictions that complement knowledge-based hypoth-
esis generation. Because these data represent multi-investigator
and multi-institution resources, the systems being measured
are diverse and discoveries are expected to be more likely to

generalize [15–17]. Big data present new opportunities, as well
as new challenges. Adapting bioinformatics curricula to address
these challenges will require us to develop curricula that pro-
vide the skills to harness big data and the skepticism to critic-
ally evaluate findings.

The challenges raised by big data that our curricula should
prepare students to address include data unification [18], com-
putational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], multiple hypoth-
esis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the data [6]. Data
unification encompasses the challenges of both data wrangling,
i.e. obtaining the necessary data in the appropriate format, as
well as the normalization necessary to make them comparable
across sources. Computational and storage limitations refer to
the difficulties and costs associated with keeping data, moving
data and analyzing data. Multiple hypothesis testing refers to
the challenge of statistically addressing the likelihood of finding
spurious associations in large data sets. Bias and confounding
in the data refer to challenges related to which experiments
have been performed or which processes are most frequently
assayed. The field is moving rapidly, and the challenges and the
solutions to them are not static. Bioinformatics trainees in the
big data era will need to be able to understand the current com-
puting environment (processor, storage, memory and network
costs) and how to, within that environment, most effectively
analyze and gain insights from large-scale data. We propose up-
dates to curricula to address these key factors.

Investments in big data training and research
Significant resources are being allocated for training scientists
in the analysis of large-scale data. Recent US governmental in-
vestments including the Big Data Initiative [20] and the NIH Big
Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative [21] focus on research and
training related to big data challenges. The Big Data Initiative
specifically aims to ‘greatly improve the tools and techniques
needed to access, organize, and glean discoveries from huge
volumes of digital data’ [20]. The 200 million dollar investment
is divided across six federal departments and agencies and will
fund both student training initiatives as well as research pro-
grams. One component of the BD2K initiative is to train re-
searchers who can harness the power of big data [21]. The
University of Washington recently received a 2.8 million dollar
National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education
and Research Traineeship (IGERT) grant entitled ‘Big Data U’
that aims to train graduate students to use big data in many dif-
ferent fields of research [22]. In the UK, the Medical Research
Council has established a 90 million pound initiative to support
big data challenges [23]. IBM has partnered with the Ministry of
Education and 100 universities in China to promote big data and
analytics training programs through a 100 million dollar invest-
ment [24].

Private foundations have also invested heavily in training
students to transform big data into new discoveries. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
are supporting New York University (NYU), The University of
California, Berkeley, and the University of Washington with a
cross-institutional 5 year 37.8 million dollar initiative to advance
data-driven discovery that will allow ‘university researchers to
harness the full potential of the data-rich world that character-
izes all fields of science and discovery’ [25]. A primary component
of this award is to empower education in data science [25].
The Li Ka Shing Foundation has given funds to promote
big data research at Oxford University and Stanford University
[26, 27].

Significant resources are also being allocated for the analysis
of big data, and trainees of bioinformatics programs that update
their curricula for big data would be ideal competitors for these
grants, such as the BD2K and Big Data initiatives. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation has directly funded academic re-
searchers through their 5 year data-driven discovery grants as
well [28].

Through these large governmental and private investments,
graduate students will have greater access to big data resources
and opportunities to learn from experts in the field, which will
aid in addressing some of the challenges that big data present.
These investments also ensure that students will be properly
trained in extracting rich information found in big data, and
they will fill a pipeline of well-trained scientists capable of
working with big data.

Changes in bioinformatics training programs
and the arrival of new data science programs
over the past 12–18 months
Bioinformatics curricula at
the undergraduate [29–34] and
graduate level [29–33, 35–38] have been reviewed previously,
and here we focus on contributions to the field in graduate edu-
cation in between 2012 and 2014. Margolis et al. [21] state that
constituencies in the ‘biomedical big data ecosystem include
data providers and users (eg, biomedical researchers, clinicians,
and citizens), data scientists, funders, publishers, and libraries’.
To create and maintain this ecosystem, bioinformatics educa-
tion is a critical component. We must train scientists who are
able to work effectively with biomedical big data. Bioinformatics
programs at every degree level exist globally; however, the ex-
tent to which these programs have updated their curricula to
accommodate the rapidly changing environment of bioinfor-
matics training is unknown. The evolving training landscape is
currently driven by the creation of data science centers and
departments that offer degree programs that mirror the compu-
tational science and statistical coursework offered by bioinfor-
matics programs. The primary difference between many
bioinformatics curricula and these new data science programs
is the specific focus on biological problems in bioinformatics
versus a wider array of topics found in data science, from busi-
ness analytics to data security. Data science programs may also
delve more deeply into computational, mathematical and stat-
istical sciences (e.g. required courses in statistical inference,
data visualization, machine learning and data management).
An exciting aspect of data science programs is that they are ex-
tremely transdisciplinary, perhaps more so than traditional bio-
informatics programs, as the data being analyzed span many
disparate fields.

For example, The Center for Data Science at NYU offers a
masters degree in data science and also launched the Moore-
Sloan Data Science Environment which allows scientists in
fields such as biology or astrophysics to collaborate across the
mathematical and computational sciences. Indiana University,
Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University, NYU and
Worcester Polytechnic Institute are just a few of the universities
that have rolled out data science graduate programs; there are
many additional schools that offer certification in data science.
These collaborative data science programs are likely to posi-
tively impact bioinformatics programs, as there should be
cross-talk between them through faculty interactions and
cross-listed courses. This synergistic environment extends be-
yond the confines of single institutions through collaborative

big data grants such as the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation initiative between NYU, UC-
Berkeley and the University of Washington, which focus on
‘championing education and training in data science at all lev-
els’ [25].

Many of these programs are addressing the challenge of
training domain experts in hard analytical skills while simul-
taneously training computational researchers in the necessary
domain knowledge. While there are diverse opinions about how
to update bioinformatics curricula to stay relevant in the era of
big data, one must also remember that enacting those updates
and training at the interface of multiple fields is inherently diffi-
cult. Graduate training in bioinformatics is difficult because it is
a rapidly evolving field, and many new graduate students come
from one field of strength (i.e. computer science or biology), ra-
ther than an interdisciplinary one. Abeln et al. [39] address this
with a fresh perspective on interdisciplinary education. Their
novel MSc program housed between VU University Amsterdam
and the University of Amsterdam allows students to choose a
track in bioinformatics or systems biology [39]. At the start of
their program, the required courses are taken alongside ‘conver-
sion courses’, which aim to bring students up to speed in two of
three areas, wherever they may be lacking expertise (molecular
biology, mathematics and programming). Throughout their pro-
gram, the classes have interdisciplinary projects that reinforce
concepts across the disciplines. Below, we propose additions to
current bioinformatics curricula, and to accommodate the
growing body of knowledge that students need to learn in the
era of big data, these additions may be difficult to fit into al-
ready challenging curricula. However, innovative approaches to
interdisciplinary education, such as the one proposed by Abeln
et al., are one way that programs may adapt their curricula to
train students more broadly in the big data deluge.

Additions to existing curricula
An important question to consider now is whether current bio-
informatics training programs are adjusting their curricula to
incorporate big data challenges. Individuals with the ability
to analyze, organize and foster discoveries from immense
volumes of data are valuable in today’s economy and will be-
come more so in the future. According to a report filed by
McKinsey and Company where they studied the economic im-
pact of big data on different economic sectors, there will be a
potential shortfall of 140 000–190 000 people for positions requir-
ing ‘deep analytical skills’ by 2018 [4]. Many bioinformatics pro-
grams were established before big data became a prominent
area of focus. These programs may need to refresh some as-
pects of their curriculum to stay competitive among other
programs and to remain competitive for funding sources. While
many aspects of data science curricula now represent import-
ant areas of bioinformatics,
the modern bioinformatics
researcher should have extensive knowledge of biology, which
is likely to extend beyond that covered in existing data science
curricula. Bioinformatics students in general benefit
from
an interdisciplinary training program that trains broadly in
computer
statistics, bioinformatics and biology.
Bioinformatics curricula updates should address data unifica-
tion [18], computational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], mul-
tiple hypothesis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the
data [6].

Bioinformatics curricula have generally focused on teaching
students how to develop computationally efficient solutions to
pressing biological challenges. We are now seeing a shift from

data-driven discovery solutions (e.g.
Below we include suggested courses on ‘The Flow of
Biological Information’, ‘Statistical Challenges of Big Data’ and
‘Computational Challenges of Big Data’. These hypothetical
courses highlight some of the most necessary biology, computa-
tional and statistical knowledge needed by the next generation
of bioinformaticists for the era of big data and provide a frame-
work for the redesign of program curricula. While we suggest
these as courses that may be added to existing curricula, these
skills may also be acquired through required coursework, elect-
ives,
journal clubs and online resources. These suggested
courses include topic areas that should be covered in a bioinfor-
matics curriculum, but more work is needed to implement and
assess the impact of training program updates. As noted in
Magana et al. [40], while the bioinformatics community has
broadly implemented curricula, little is known about the effect-
iveness of these curricula on learning objectives. As with any
graduate curriculum,
it should be tailored to the student’s
strengths and deficiencies to enable the greatest chance for
success.

To remain at the forefront of bioinformatics education, cur-
ricula should be updated on an annual or biennial basis. Course
instructors should adjust curricula as necessary based on ad-
vancements in the field. They should also engage with current
students in their classes to assess class activity and topic use-
fulness, obtain class evaluations during and after the class
ends, as well as stay in contact with class/program alumni to
discuss the impact of the class on their success after graduation
[41]. Additionally, it is helpful in an interdisciplinary program
like bioinformatics to have regular faculty meetings across the
disciplines in the core curricula to communicate how the pro-
gram curricula should evolve as a whole based on advance-
ments in their respective fields.

curricula.

Suggested additional course: The Flow of
Biological Information
While a broad overview of molecular biology is most thoroughly
accomplished through a series of graduate courses in biology, it
is not always feasible to incorporate a lengthy course series into
existing
Stanford
University, in 1998, published five areas of competence for bio-
informatics training: biology, computer science, statistics, eth-
ics and core bioinformatics [35].
In a recent update [42],
Professor Altman said, ‘For biomedicine, there is little doubt
that the best data scientists will be those who understand the
special features and challenges in biology or medicine, and thus
make assumptions and approximations that are valid and not
fatal’.

Professor Russ Altman of

The large-scale data being generated in biology measure
genome sequences, gene expression, protein signaling and
other areas of information flow through complex biological sys-
tems. We describe a blended molecular biology and genetics
course entitled ‘The Flow of Biological Information’, which
would serve as a primer on the areas of biology that are fre-
quently encountered by bioinformatics students (Figure 1). This
course is intended to provide students with an understanding
of the measurements behind their data. Professor Lawrence
Hunter from the University of Colorado Denver emphasized the
importance of this knowledge when he said [42], ‘Insights into
the idiosyncrasies of instruments such as mass spectrometers
and hybridization arrays have led to dramatic improvements in

informatics methods not available to those who treat data as a
“given”’. In addition to developing an understanding of the
underlying experimental platforms, this course will familiarize
students with the data formats and skills necessary for data
wrangling in this domain [43].

Each week covers an important type of biology information
storage and processing. The conceptual lectures are paired with
a lab in which the students analyze data relevant to the week’s
lecture using recently developed methods. During lectures
focused on each type of information, students will be exposed
to the types of data that are commonly used to measure these
systems. To effectively carry out these labs, students should
have a strong programming background when coming into the
course. A common theme throughout the course should be the
data and knowledge biases associated with each type of
information.

The course is organized around key types of information
transfer, organized into three modules. The first module is
Transmission Between Generations (heredity, molecular gen-
etics—mitosis/meiosis, epigenetics) with lectures in DNA (struc-
ture and DNA as an information storage medium), mitosis (how
genomes are copied, errors that can arise), meiosis (genetic vari-
ation at the population level) and epigenetics (inheritance can
occur beyond the level of nucleic acid sequence). Example labs
relating to these lecture topics include aligning reads to a gen-
ome (e.g. Bowtie [44]), identification of somatic variations in
cancer (e.g. apply MuTect [45]), 1000 genomes/variant annota-
tions (e.g. [46]) and bisulfite sequencing alignment (e.g. [47]).
The second module covers Transmission Within the Cell [epi-
genetics, transcriptional regulation (mRNA, miRNA and siRNA)
and translational regulation (protein, phosphorylation)] and has
lectures on epigenetics (epigenetic marks as a means to define
cell-lineages), regulation of transcription (transcription factor
binding, motifs, ChIP-seq), steady-state mRNA levels (how
genes are expressed to mRNA), noncoding RNA (RNAi, miRNA,
siRNA, lncRNA and their role in regulation) and proteomics
(translational and posttranslational regulation). The last mod-
ule is Transmission Between Cells [instant messaging (small
molecule signaling), recognition of nonself (immunology) and

talking with others (quorum sensing)] and discusses small mol-
ecule signaling (neurotransmitters, etc), recognition of nonself
and quorum sensing. The course is capped by a student-defined
final project through which they integrate two or more data
types covered within the course.

Suggested additional course: Statistical
Challenges of Big Data
For example, the uncertainty around results represents an im-
portant and fast-moving area. In an interview about the chal-
lenges of big data, Michael I. Jordon from the University of
California, Berkeley, states, ‘We have to have error bars around
all our predictions. That is something that’s missing in much of
the current machine learning literature’ [48]. He likens this to
bridge building: ‘If I have no principles, and I build thousands
of bridges without any actual science, lots of them will fall
down, and great disasters will occur’ [48]. He states that predic-
tion error bars will take years of research, highlighting one rea-
son why bioinformatics education in big data analysis is
important and will require curricula to be updated as the field
evolves.

Analyzing big data presents additional statistical challenges.
In such data, even infrequent observations are expected to be
frequent. As The Whitlams’ song Up Against the Wall notes,
‘She was one in a million, yeah; So there’s five more, just in
New South Wales’ [49]. In a data set with a trillion observations,
we expect 1000 ‘one in a billion’ events. Experiments to evaluate
results from the analysis of big data need to take this into
account.

This course is organized around principles of experimental
design, hypothesis testing and machine learning and is paired
each week with an associated lab that reinforces the concepts
learned during the week’s lectures (Figure 2). This course would
include motivating examples from recent literature and would
use data sets for data types covered in the transmission of infor-
mation course. A strong emphasis would be placed on the crit-
ical evaluation of potential discoveries, with specific training

toward recognizing knowledge or data biases that could lead to
spurious discoveries.

The first key module is Experimental Design (parameter op-
timization, blinded evaluations, independence) and has lectures
on hyperparameter optimization (parameter sweep), method
evaluation (permutation testing, blinded evaluations) and key
assumptions of methods (independence, naı¨ve Bayes). Example
labs for these lectures include a parameter sweep for an appro-
priate ‘c’ using support vector machines (SVM), evaluation to
see if this SVM works better than random and using a naı¨ve
Bayes classifier to combine simulated data with nonindepend-
ence and/or random data (which is worse?). The second module
is based on Hypothesis Testing (parametric, nonparametric,
multiple testing) and features lecture topics on parametric stat-
istical methods, nonparametric statistics and multiple hypoth-
esis testing (good and bad uses, Type I and II error). The last
module focuses on machine learning (data-driven model con-
struction, regularization), with lectures on unsupervised meth-
ods (clustering, PCA), supervised methods (regression and
classification), semi-supervised methods (classification), regu-
larization (lasso, ridge, elastic net) and artificial intelligence.
The conclusion of the course is focused on a student project to
use all of the knowledge gained from the course to analyze a
new data set, extract novel insights and analyze the validity of
the results.

Suggested additional course: Computational
Challenges of Big Data
Analyzing big data present new computational challenges.
These data may need to be analyzed in a distributed manner,
the analyses performed should be highly reproducible to allow
for thorough evaluation of potential biases, and results need to
be presented as effective visual summaries. Our proposed
course touches on each of these areas (Figure 3).

To address the challenge of feasibility, we introduce stu-
dents to cloud computing. Vasant Dhar, Professor and Director
of the Center for Business Analytics at NYU’s Stern School of
Business, recently highlighted cloud computing and distributed
computing as necessary components of a data science educa-
tion [50]. To address reproducibility, we introduce workflow
automation, version control and unit testing [51–53]. For visual-
ization, we use the modern javascript library, d3.js, to teach
students to make high-content visualizations of complex data
sets.

While each of these topics is large enough to be covered in
an individual course, the emphasis of this course is on provid-
ing students with the groundwork necessary to identify the ap-
propriate courses and focus areas for a given challenge. The
laboratory components of this course would be conducted en-
tirely using cloud computing resources (e.g. through Amazon’s
EC2). This would provide students with efficient solutions for
multiple types of data, expertise in managing a cloud comput-
ing system and an important background in conveying results
to a broader audience.

The first module is Feasibility (distributed problem solving
and cloud computing) with lectures in cloud computing (what
is it, how to use it and cost drivers) and distributed problem-
solving. Example labs include creating a cloud instance and
performing an analysis, implementing a parameter sweep/em-
barrassingly parallel process and read mapping across many
reads or building a model with many examples. The second
module focuses on Reproducibility (shell scripting, workflow
automation and unit testing) and contains lectures on workflow
automation in biology (make, galaxy, etc), version control (git,
github, mercurial and bitbucket) and unit testing (unit test
library for a programming language of choice). The last module
is Visual Analytics (building meaningful visualizations, testing
visualizations), including topics on D3 visualization, making
visualizations useful and unit testing for javascript. The course
is capped by a project in which the students integrate what

they have learned in this course with the biology and statistics
components of the curriculum. The final project uses cloud
computing to do an analysis that is infeasible on a single ma-
chine using an automated workflow stored in a version control
system and to visualize the results in an informative way.

Conclusion
We are living in a data revolution, where four dimensions de-
fine big data: volume, velocity, variety and veracity [54]. Because
of the complexity of biomedical big data, there is a growing
need to produce bioinformatics professionals that are capable
of processing, analyzing and interpreting big data. While big
data bring great promise, there are many associated challenges
with it as well. There is a need to update bioinformatics curric-
ula to address these challenges, which requires us to develop
curricula that provide the appropriate skillset for analyzing big
data along with the knowledge to extract and determine the val-
idity of key findings. Curricula updates should address data uni-
fication [18], computational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19],
multiple hypothesis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the
data [6]. We have also proposed three courses in ‘The Flow of
Biological Information’, ‘Statistical Challenges of Big Data’ and
‘Computational Challenges of Big Data’. These courses feature
the most necessary biology, computational and statistical
knowledge needed for students to graduate as well-informed
bioinformaticians in the era of big data. The courses may be
added to current bioinformatics curricula or may serve as a
jumping off point for the inclusion of new lectures into courses
already being taught. Additionally, many schools now offer data
science programs. The coursework housed in these programs
may facilitate educational updates to bioinformatics programs
through the cross-listing of relevant courses and other scholarly
activities. As Welch et al. [33] showed, companies are now look-
ing for bioinformaticians who are able to work effectively with
big data, and thus, we must augment bioinformatics curricula

Abstract
Modern technologies are capable of generating enormous amounts of data that measure complex biological systems.
Computational biologists and bioinformatics scientists are increasingly being asked to use these data to reveal key systems-
level properties. We review the extent to which curricula are changing in the era of big data. We identify key competencies
that scientists dealing with big data are expected to possess across ﬁelds, and we use this information to propose courses to
meet these growing needs. While bioinformatics programs have traditionally trained students in data-intensive science, we
identify areas of particular biological, computational and statistical emphasis important for this era that can be incorpo-
rated into existing curricula. For each area, we propose a course structured around these topics, which can be adapted in
whole or in parts into existing curricula. In summary, speciﬁc challenges associated with big data provide an important
opportunity to update existing curricula, but we do not foresee a wholesale redesign of bioinformatics training programs.

Key words: big data; bioinformatics; data science; education

Big data challenges
The modern quantitative scientist is awash in a data deluge.
The amount of data being generated far outweighs that being
thoroughly analyzed. For example, Wal-mart stores process
more than 1 million customer transactions per hour, and users
upload >100 h of video content per minute on YouTube [1, 2]. It
is clear that some data are ‘big’ and that such big data come in
many forms and are of great interest to a variety of groups,
from biologists to law enforcement, social services, private
companies and homeland security [3]. There is no consensus on
what constitutes big data [4, 5]. In general, the concept encom-
passes collections that are too large to manage and analyze
using traditional approaches. Under this model, what specific-
ally constitutes big data is a field-specific moving target that
grows as research advances.

The data that meet this definition in biology and medicine
are generated from numerous sources, including laboratory

experiments, medical records and insurance/claims data [6] and
are accessible via online databases such as the ArrayExpress re-
pository [7], the eMERGE network [8] and the SEER-Medicare
database, respectively [9]. Biomedical big data are emerging
from the combination of small data sources as well. For ex-
ample, as scientists share their laboratory experiments with
others in ArrayExpress, this creates a resource containing
>54 000 genome-wide experiments measuring >1.6 million con-
ditions [7]. These aggregate big data are inherently economical
to use, as the cost of data generation is shared over many labs,
and computational methods have been developed to use these
aggregate data [10–14].

Biomedical big data provide the opportunity to develop data-
driven predictions that complement knowledge-based hypoth-

and multi-institution resources, the systems being measured
are diverse and discoveries are expected to be more likely to

generalize [15–17]. Big data present new opportunities, as well
as new challenges. Adapting bioinformatics curricula to address
these challenges will require us to develop curricula that pro-
vide the skills to harness big data and the skepticism to critic-
ally evaluate findings.

The challenges raised by big data that our curricula should
prepare students to address include data unification [18], com-
putational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], multiple hypoth-
esis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the data [6]. Data
unification encompasses the challenges of both data wrangling,
i.e. obtaining the necessary data in the appropriate format, as
well as the normalization necessary to make them comparable
across sources. Computational and storage limitations refer to
the difficulties and costs associated with keeping data, moving
data and analyzing data. Multiple hypothesis testing refers to
the challenge of statistically addressing the likelihood of finding
spurious associations in large data sets. Bias and confounding
in the data refer to challenges related to which experiments
have been performed or which processes are most frequently
assayed. The field is moving rapidly, and the challenges and the
solutions to them are not static. Bioinformatics trainees in the
big data era will need to be able to understand the current com-
puting environment (processor, storage, memory and network
costs) and how to, within that environment, most effectively
analyze and gain insights from large-scale data. We propose up-
dates to curricula to address these key factors.

Investments in big data training and research
Significant resources are being allocated for training scientists
in the analysis of large-scale data. Recent US governmental in-
vestments including the Big Data Initiative [20] and the NIH Big
Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative [21] focus on research and
training related to big data challenges. The Big Data Initiative
specifically aims to ‘greatly improve the tools and techniques
needed to access, organize, and glean discoveries from huge
volumes of digital data’ [20]. The 200 million dollar investment
is divided across six federal departments and agencies and will
fund both student training initiatives as well as research pro-
grams. One component of the BD2K initiative is to train re-
searchers who can harness the power of big data [21]. The
University of Washington recently received a 2.8 million dollar
National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education
and Research Traineeship (IGERT) grant entitled ‘Big Data U’
that aims to train graduate students to use big data in many dif-
ferent fields of research [22]. In the UK, the Medical Research
Council has established a 90 million pound initiative to support
big data challenges [23]. IBM has partnered with the Ministry of
Education and 100 universities in China to promote big data and
analytics training programs through a 100 million dollar invest-
ment [24].

Private foundations have also invested heavily in training
students to transform big data into new discoveries. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
are supporting New York University (NYU), The University of
California, Berkeley, and the University of Washington with a
cross-institutional 5 year 37.8 million dollar initiative to advance
data-driven discovery that will allow ‘university researchers to
harness the full potential of the data-rich world that character-
izes all fields of science and discovery’ [25]. A primary component
of this award is to empower education in data science [25].
The Li Ka Shing Foundation has given funds to promote
big data research at Oxford University and Stanford University
[26, 27].

Significant resources are also being allocated for the analysis
of big data, and trainees of bioinformatics programs that update
their curricula for big data would be ideal competitors for these
grants, such as the BD2K and Big Data initiatives. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation has directly funded academic re-
searchers through their 5 year data-driven discovery grants as
well [28].

Through these large governmental and private investments,
graduate students will have greater access to big data resources
and opportunities to learn from experts in the field, which will
aid in addressing some of the challenges that big data present.
These investments also ensure that students will be properly
trained in extracting rich information found in big data, and
they will fill a pipeline of well-trained scientists capable of
working with big data.

Changes in bioinformatics training programs
and the arrival of new data science programs
over the past 12–18 months
Bioinformatics curricula at
the undergraduate [29–34] and
graduate level [29–33, 35–38] have been reviewed previously,
and here we focus on contributions to the field in graduate edu-
cation in between 2012 and 2014. Margolis et al. [21] state that
constituencies in the ‘biomedical big data ecosystem include
data providers and users (eg, biomedical researchers, clinicians,
and citizens), data scientists, funders, publishers, and libraries’.
To create and maintain this ecosystem, bioinformatics educa-
tion is a critical component. We must train scientists who are
able to work effectively with biomedical big data. Bioinformatics
programs at every degree level exist globally; however, the ex-
tent to which these programs have updated their curricula to
accommodate the rapidly changing environment of bioinfor-
matics training is unknown. The evolving training landscape is
currently driven by the creation of data science centers and
departments that offer degree programs that mirror the compu-
tational science and statistical coursework offered by bioinfor-
matics programs. The primary difference between many
bioinformatics curricula and these new data science programs
is the specific focus on biological problems in bioinformatics
versus a wider array of topics found in data science, from busi-
ness analytics to data security. Data science programs may also
delve more deeply into computational, mathematical and stat-
istical sciences (e.g. required courses in statistical inference,
data visualization, machine learning and data management).
An exciting aspect of data science programs is that they are ex-
tremely transdisciplinary, perhaps more so than traditional bio-
informatics programs, as the data being analyzed span many
disparate fields.

For example, The Center for Data Science at NYU offers a
masters degree in data science and also launched the Moore-
Sloan Data Science Environment which allows scientists in
fields such as biology or astrophysics to collaborate across the
mathematical and computational sciences. Indiana University,
Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University, NYU and
Worcester Polytechnic Institute are just a few of the universities
that have rolled out data science graduate programs; there are
many additional schools that offer certification in data science.
These collaborative data science programs are likely to posi-
tively impact bioinformatics programs, as there should be
cross-talk between them through faculty interactions and
cross-listed courses. This synergistic environment extends be-
yond the confines of single institutions through collaborative

big data grants such as the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation initiative between NYU, UC-
Berkeley and the University of Washington, which focus on
‘championing education and training in data science at all lev-
els’ [25].

Many of these programs are addressing the challenge of
training domain experts in hard analytical skills while simul-
taneously training computational researchers in the necessary
domain knowledge. While there are diverse opinions about how
to update bioinformatics curricula to stay relevant in the era of
big data, one must also remember that enacting those updates
and training at the interface of multiple fields is inherently diffi-
cult. Graduate training in bioinformatics is difficult because it is
a rapidly evolving field, and many new graduate students come
from one field of strength (i.e. computer science or biology), ra-
ther than an interdisciplinary one. Abeln et al. [39] address this
with a fresh perspective on interdisciplinary education. Their
novel MSc program housed between VU University Amsterdam
and the University of Amsterdam allows students to choose a
track in bioinformatics or systems biology [39]. At the start of
their program, the required courses are taken alongside ‘conver-
sion courses’, which aim to bring students up to speed in two of
three areas, wherever they may be lacking expertise (molecular
biology, mathematics and programming). Throughout their pro-
gram, the classes have interdisciplinary projects that reinforce
concepts across the disciplines. Below, we propose additions to
current bioinformatics curricula, and to accommodate the
growing body of knowledge that students need to learn in the
era of big data, these additions may be difficult to fit into al-
ready challenging curricula. However, innovative approaches to
interdisciplinary education, such as the one proposed by Abeln
et al., are one way that programs may adapt their curricula to
train students more broadly in the big data deluge.

Additions to existing curricula
An important question to consider now is whether current bio-
informatics training programs are adjusting their curricula to
incorporate big data challenges. Individuals with the ability
to analyze, organize and foster discoveries from immense
volumes of data are valuable in today’s economy and will be-
come more so in the future. According to a report filed by
McKinsey and Company where they studied the economic im-
pact of big data on different economic sectors, there will be a
potential shortfall of 140 000–190 000 people for positions requir-
ing ‘deep analytical skills’ by 2018 [4]. Many bioinformatics pro-
grams were established before big data became a prominent
area of focus. These programs may need to refresh some as-
pects of their curriculum to stay competitive among other
programs and to remain competitive for funding sources. While
many aspects of data science curricula now represent import-
ant areas of bioinformatics,
the modern bioinformatics
researcher should have extensive knowledge of biology, which
is likely to extend beyond that covered in existing data science
curricula. Bioinformatics students in general benefit
from
an interdisciplinary training program that trains broadly in
computer
statistics, bioinformatics and biology.
Bioinformatics curricula updates should address data unifica-
tion [18], computational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], mul-
tiple hypothesis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the
data [6].

Bioinformatics curricula have generally focused on teaching
students how to develop computationally efficient solutions to
pressing biological challenges. We are now seeing a shift from

data-driven discovery solutions (e.g.
Below we include suggested courses on ‘The Flow of
Biological Information’, ‘Statistical Challenges of Big Data’ and
‘Computational Challenges of Big Data’. These hypothetical
courses highlight some of the most necessary biology, computa-
tional and statistical knowledge needed by the next generation
of bioinformaticists for the era of big data and provide a frame-
work for the redesign of program curricula. While we suggest
these as courses that may be added to existing curricula, these
skills may also be acquired through required coursework, elect-
ives,
journal clubs and online resources. These suggested
courses include topic areas that should be covered in a bioinfor-
matics curriculum, but more work is needed to implement and
assess the impact of training program updates. As noted in
Magana et al. [40], while the bioinformatics community has
broadly implemented curricula, little is known about the effect-
iveness of these curricula on learning objectives. As with any
graduate curriculum,
it should be tailored to the student’s
strengths and deficiencies to enable the greatest chance for
success.

To remain at the forefront of bioinformatics education, cur-
ricula should be updated on an annual or biennial basis. Course
instructors should adjust curricula as necessary based on ad-
vancements in the field. They should also engage with current
students in their classes to assess class activity and topic use-
fulness, obtain class evaluations during and after the class
ends, as well as stay in contact with class/program alumni to
discuss the impact of the class on their success after graduation
[41]. Additionally, it is helpful in an interdisciplinary program
like bioinformatics to have regular faculty meetings across the
disciplines in the core curricula to communicate how the pro-
gram curricula should evolve as a whole based on advance-
ments in their respective fields.

curricula.

Suggested additional course: The Flow of
Biological Information
While a broad overview of molecular biology is most thoroughly
accomplished through a series of graduate courses in biology, it
is not always feasible to incorporate a lengthy course series into
existing
Stanford
University, in 1998, published five areas of competence for bio-
informatics training: biology, computer science, statistics, eth-
ics and core bioinformatics [35].
In a recent update [42],
Professor Altman said, ‘For biomedicine, there is little doubt
that the best data scientists will be those who understand the
special features and challenges in biology or medicine, and thus
make assumptions and approximations that are valid and not
fatal’.

Professor Russ Altman of

The large-scale data being generated in biology measure
genome sequences, gene expression, protein signaling and
other areas of information flow through complex biological sys-
tems. We describe a blended molecular biology and genetics
course entitled ‘The Flow of Biological Information’, which
would serve as a primer on the areas of biology that are fre-
quently encountered by bioinformatics students (Figure 1). This
course is intended to provide students with an understanding
of the measurements behind their data. Professor Lawrence
Hunter from the University of Colorado Denver emphasized the
importance of this knowledge when he said [42], ‘Insights into
the idiosyncrasies of instruments such as mass spectrometers
and hybridization arrays have led to dramatic improvements in

informatics methods not available to those who treat data as a
“given”’. In addition to developing an understanding of the
underlying experimental platforms, this course will familiarize
students with the data formats and skills necessary for data
wrangling in this domain [43].

Each week covers an important type of biology information
storage and processing. The conceptual lectures are paired with
a lab in which the students analyze data relevant to the week’s
lecture using recently developed methods. During lectures
focused on each type of information, students will be exposed
to the types of data that are commonly used to measure these
systems. To effectively carry out these labs, students should
have a strong programming background when coming into the
course. A common theme throughout the course should be the
data and knowledge biases associated with each type of
information.

The course is organized around key types of information
transfer, organized into three modules. The first module is
Transmission Between Generations (heredity, molecular gen-
etics—mitosis/meiosis, epigenetics) with lectures in DNA (struc-
ture and DNA as an information storage medium), mitosis (how
genomes are copied, errors that can arise), meiosis (genetic vari-
ation at the population level) and epigenetics (inheritance can
occur beyond the level of nucleic acid sequence). Example labs
relating to these lecture topics include aligning reads to a gen-
ome (e.g. Bowtie [44]), identification of somatic variations in
cancer (e.g. apply MuTect [45]), 1000 genomes/variant annota-
tions (e.g. [46]) and bisulfite sequencing alignment (e.g. [47]).
The second module covers Transmission Within the Cell [epi-
genetics, transcriptional regulation (mRNA, miRNA and siRNA)
and translational regulation (protein, phosphorylation)] and has
lectures on epigenetics (epigenetic marks as a means to define
cell-lineages), regulation of transcription (transcription factor
binding, motifs, ChIP-seq), steady-state mRNA levels (how
genes are expressed to mRNA), noncoding RNA (RNAi, miRNA,
siRNA, lncRNA and their role in regulation) and proteomics
(translational and posttranslational regulation). The last mod-
ule is Transmission Between Cells [instant messaging (small
molecule signaling), recognition of nonself (immunology) and

talking with others (quorum sensing)] and discusses small mol-
ecule signaling (neurotransmitters, etc), recognition of nonself
and quorum sensing. The course is capped by a student-defined
final project through which they integrate two or more data
types covered within the course.

Suggested additional course: Statistical
Challenges of Big Data
For example, the uncertainty around results represents an im-
portant and fast-moving area. In an interview about the chal-
lenges of big data, Michael I. Jordon from the University of
California, Berkeley, states, ‘We have to have error bars around
all our predictions. That is something that’s missing in much of
the current machine learning literature’ [48]. He likens this to
bridge building: ‘If I have no principles, and I build thousands
of bridges without any actual science, lots of them will fall
down, and great disasters will occur’ [48]. He states that predic-
tion error bars will take years of research, highlighting one rea-
son why bioinformatics education in big data analysis is
important and will require curricula to be updated as the field
evolves.

Analyzing big data presents additional statistical challenges.
In such data, even infrequent observations are expected to be
frequent. As The Whitlams’ song Up Against the Wall notes,
‘She was one in a million, yeah; So there’s five more, just in
New South Wales’ [49]. In a data set with a trillion observations,
we expect 1000 ‘one in a billion’ events. Experiments to evaluate
results from the analysis of big data need to take this into
account.

This course is organized around principles of experimental
design, hypothesis testing and machine learning and is paired
each week with an associated lab that reinforces the concepts
learned during the week’s lectures (Figure 2). This course would
include motivating examples from recent literature and would
use data sets for data types covered in the transmission of infor-
mation course. A strong emphasis would be placed on the crit-
ical evaluation of potential discoveries, with specific training

toward recognizing knowledge or data biases that could lead to
spurious discoveries.

The first key module is Experimental Design (parameter op-
timization, blinded evaluations, independence) and has lectures
on hyperparameter optimization (parameter sweep), method
evaluation (permutation testing, blinded evaluations) and key
assumptions of methods (independence, naı¨ve Bayes). Example
labs for these lectures include a parameter sweep for an appro-
priate ‘c’ using support vector machines (SVM), evaluation to
see if this SVM works better than random and using a naı¨ve
Bayes classifier to combine simulated data with nonindepend-
ence and/or random data (which is worse?). The second module
is based on Hypothesis Testing (parametric, nonparametric,
multiple testing) and features lecture topics on parametric stat-
istical methods, nonparametric statistics and multiple hypoth-
esis testing (good and bad uses, Type I and II error). The last
module focuses on machine learning (data-driven model con-
struction, regularization), with lectures on unsupervised meth-
ods (clustering, PCA), supervised methods (regression and
classification), semi-supervised methods (classification), regu-
larization (lasso, ridge, elastic net) and artificial intelligence.
The conclusion of the course is focused on a student project to
use all of the knowledge gained from the course to analyze a
new data set, extract novel insights and analyze the validity of
the results.

Suggested additional course: Computational
Challenges of Big Data
Analyzing big data present new computational challenges.
These data may need to be analyzed in a distributed manner,
the analyses performed should be highly reproducible to allow
for thorough evaluation of potential biases, and results need to
be presented as effective visual summaries. Our proposed
course touches on each of these areas (Figure 3).

To address the challenge of feasibility, we introduce stu-
dents to cloud computing. Vasant Dhar, Professor and Director
of the Center for Business Analytics at NYU’s Stern School of
Business, recently highlighted cloud computing and distributed
computing as necessary components of a data science educa-
tion [50]. To address reproducibility, we introduce workflow
automation, version control and unit testing [51–53]. For visual-
ization, we use the modern javascript library, d3.js, to teach
students to make high-content visualizations of complex data
sets.

While each of these topics is large enough to be covered in
an individual course, the emphasis of this course is on provid-
ing students with the groundwork necessary to identify the ap-
propriate courses and focus areas for a given challenge. The
laboratory components of this course would be conducted en-
tirely using cloud computing resources (e.g. through Amazon’s
EC2). This would provide students with efficient solutions for
multiple types of data, expertise in managing a cloud comput-
ing system and an important background in conveying results
to a broader audience.

The first module is Feasibility (distributed problem solving
and cloud computing) with lectures in cloud computing (what
is it, how to use it and cost drivers) and distributed problem-
solving. Example labs include creating a cloud instance and
performing an analysis, implementing a parameter sweep/em-
barrassingly parallel process and read mapping across many
reads or building a model with many examples. The second
module focuses on Reproducibility (shell scripting, workflow
automation and unit testing) and contains lectures on workflow
automation in biology (make, galaxy, etc), version control (git,
github, mercurial and bitbucket) and unit testing (unit test
library for a programming language of choice). The last module
is Visual Analytics (building meaningful visualizations, testing
visualizations), including topics on D3 visualization, making
visualizations useful and unit testing for javascript. The course
is capped by a project in which the students integrate what

they have learned in this course with the biology and statistics
components of the curriculum. The final project uses cloud
computing to do an analysis that is infeasible on a single ma-
chine using an automated workflow stored in a version control
system and to visualize the results in an informative way.

Conclusion
We are living in a data revolution, where four dimensions de-
fine big data: volume, velocity, variety and veracity [54]. Because
of the complexity of biomedical big data, there is a growing
need to produce bioinformatics professionals that are capable
of processing, analyzing and interpreting big data. While big
data bring great promise, there are many associated challenges
with it as well. There is a need to update bioinformatics curric-
ula to address these challenges, which requires us to develop
curricula that provide the appropriate skillset for analyzing big
data along with the knowledge to extract and determine the val-
idity of key findings. Curricula updates should address data uni-
fication [18], computational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19],
multiple hypothesis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the
data [6]. We have also proposed three courses in ‘The Flow of
Biological Information’, ‘Statistical Challenges of Big Data’ and
‘Computational Challenges of Big Data’. These courses feature
the most necessary biology, computational and statistical
knowledge needed for students to graduate as well-informed
bioinformaticians in the era of big data. The courses may be
added to current bioinformatics curricula or may serve as a
jumping off point for the inclusion of new lectures into courses
already being taught. Additionally, many schools now offer data
science programs. The coursework housed in these programs
may facilitate educational updates to bioinformatics programs
through the cross-listing of relevant courses and other scholarly
activities. As Welch et al. [33] showed, companies are now look-
ing for bioinformaticians who are able to work effectively with
big data, and thus, we must augment bioinformatics curricula

Abstract
Modern technologies are capable of generating enormous amounts of data that measure complex biological systems.
Computational biologists and bioinformatics scientists are increasingly being asked to use these data to reveal key systems-
level properties. We review the extent to which curricula are changing in the era of big data. We identify key competencies
that scientists dealing with big data are expected to possess across ﬁelds, and we use this information to propose courses to
meet these growing needs. While bioinformatics programs have traditionally trained students in data-intensive science, we
identify areas of particular biological, computational and statistical emphasis important for this era that can be incorpo-
rated into existing curricula. For each area, we propose a course structured around these topics, which can be adapted in
whole or in parts into existing curricula. In summary, speciﬁc challenges associated with big data provide an important
opportunity to update existing curricula, but we do not foresee a wholesale redesign of bioinformatics training programs.

Key words: big data; bioinformatics; data science; education

Big data challenges
The modern quantitative scientist is awash in a data deluge.
The amount of data being generated far outweighs that being
thoroughly analyzed. For example, Wal-mart stores process
more than 1 million customer transactions per hour, and users
upload >100 h of video content per minute on YouTube [1, 2]. It
is clear that some data are ‘big’ and that such big data come in
many forms and are of great interest to a variety of groups,
from biologists to law enforcement, social services, private
companies and homeland security [3]. There is no consensus on
what constitutes big data [4, 5]. In general, the concept encom-
passes collections that are too large to manage and analyze
using traditional approaches. Under this model, what specific-
ally constitutes big data is a field-specific moving target that
grows as research advances.

The data that meet this definition in biology and medicine
are generated from numerous sources, including laboratory

experiments, medical records and insurance/claims data [6] and
are accessible via online databases such as the ArrayExpress re-
pository [7], the eMERGE network [8] and the SEER-Medicare
database, respectively [9]. Biomedical big data are emerging
from the combination of small data sources as well. For ex-
ample, as scientists share their laboratory experiments with
others in ArrayExpress, this creates a resource containing
>54 000 genome-wide experiments measuring >1.6 million con-
ditions [7]. These aggregate big data are inherently economical
to use, as the cost of data generation is shared over many labs,
and computational methods have been developed to use these
aggregate data [10–14].

Biomedical big data provide the opportunity to develop data-
driven predictions that complement knowledge-based hypoth-
esis generation. Because these data represent multi-investigator
and multi-institution resources, the systems being measured
are diverse and discoveries are expected to be more likely to

generalize [15–17]. Big data present new opportunities, as well
as new challenges. Adapting bioinformatics curricula to address
these challenges will require us to develop curricula that pro-
vide the skills to harness big data and the skepticism to critic-
ally evaluate findings.

The challenges raised by big data that our curricula should
prepare students to address include data unification [18], com-
putational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], multiple hypoth-
esis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the data [6]. Data
unification encompasses the challenges of both data wrangling,
i.e. obtaining the necessary data in the appropriate format, as
well as the normalization necessary to make them comparable
across sources. Computational and storage limitations refer to
the difficulties and costs associated with keeping data, moving
data and analyzing data. Multiple hypothesis testing refers to
the challenge of statistically addressing the likelihood of finding
spurious associations in large data sets. Bias and confounding
in the data refer to challenges related to which experiments
have been performed or which processes are most frequently
assayed. The field is moving rapidly, and the challenges and the
solutions to them are not static. Bioinformatics trainees in the
big data era will need to be able to understand the current com-
puting environment (processor, storage, memory and network
costs) and how to, within that environment, most effectively
analyze and gain insights from large-scale data. We propose up-
dates to curricula to address these key factors.

Investments in big data training and research
Significant resources are being allocated for training scientists
in the analysis of large-scale data. Recent US governmental in-
vestments including the Big Data Initiative [20] and the NIH Big
Data to Knowledge (BD2K) initiative [21] focus on research and
training related to big data challenges. The Big Data Initiative
specifically aims to ‘greatly improve the tools and techniques
needed to access, organize, and glean discoveries from huge
volumes of digital data’ [20]. The 200 million dollar investment
is divided across six federal departments and agencies and will
fund both student training initiatives as well as research pro-
grams. One component of the BD2K initiative is to train re-
searchers who can harness the power of big data [21]. The
University of Washington recently received a 2.8 million dollar
National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education
and Research Traineeship (IGERT) grant entitled ‘Big Data U’
that aims to train graduate students to use big data in many dif-
ferent fields of research [22]. In the UK, the Medical Research
Council has established a 90 million pound initiative to support
big data challenges [23]. IBM has partnered with the Ministry of
Education and 100 universities in China to promote big data and
analytics training programs through a 100 million dollar invest-
ment [24].

Private foundations have also invested heavily in training
students to transform big data into new discoveries. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
are supporting New York University (NYU), The University of
California, Berkeley, and the University of Washington with a
cross-institutional 5 year 37.8 million dollar initiative to advance
data-driven discovery that will allow ‘university researchers to
harness the full potential of the data-rich world that character-
izes all fields of science and discovery’ [25]. A primary component
of this award is to empower education in data science [25].
The Li Ka Shing Foundation has given funds to promote
big data research at Oxford University and Stanford University
[26, 27].

Significant resources are also being allocated for the analysis
of big data, and trainees of bioinformatics programs that update
their curricula for big data would be ideal competitors for these
grants, such as the BD2K and Big Data initiatives. The Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation has directly funded academic re-
searchers through their 5 year data-driven discovery grants as
well [28].

Through these large governmental and private investments,
graduate students will have greater access to big data resources
and opportunities to learn from experts in the field, which will
aid in addressing some of the challenges that big data present.
These investments also ensure that students will be properly
trained in extracting rich information found in big data, and
they will fill a pipeline of well-trained scientists capable of
working with big data.

Changes in bioinformatics training programs
and the arrival of new data science programs
over the past 12–18 months
Bioinformatics curricula at
the undergraduate [29–34] and
graduate level [29–33, 35–38] have been reviewed previously,
and here we focus on contributions to the field in graduate edu-
cation in between 2012 and 2014. Margolis et al. [21] state that
constituencies in the ‘biomedical big data ecosystem include
data providers and users (eg, biomedical researchers, clinicians,
and citizens), data scientists, funders, publishers, and libraries’.
To create and maintain this ecosystem, bioinformatics educa-
tion is a critical component. We must train scientists who are
able to work effectively with biomedical big data. Bioinformatics
programs at every degree level exist globally; however, the ex-
tent to which these programs have updated their curricula to
accommodate the rapidly changing environment of bioinfor-
matics training is unknown. The evolving training landscape is
currently driven by the creation of data science centers and
departments that offer degree programs that mirror the compu-
tational science and statistical coursework offered by bioinfor-
matics programs. The primary difference between many
bioinformatics curricula and these new data science programs
is the specific focus on biological problems in bioinformatics
versus a wider array of topics found in data science, from busi-
ness analytics to data security. Data science programs may also
delve more deeply into computational, mathematical and stat-
istical sciences (e.g. required courses in statistical inference,
data visualization, machine learning and data management).
An exciting aspect of data science programs is that they are ex-
tremely transdisciplinary, perhaps more so than traditional bio-
informatics programs, as the data being analyzed span many
disparate fields.

For example, The Center for Data Science at NYU offers a
masters degree in data science and also launched the Moore-
Sloan Data Science Environment which allows scientists in
fields such as biology or astrophysics to collaborate across the
mathematical and computational sciences. Indiana University,
Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon University, NYU and
Worcester Polytechnic Institute are just a few of the universities
that have rolled out data science graduate programs; there are
many additional schools that offer certification in data science.
These collaborative data science programs are likely to posi-
tively impact bioinformatics programs, as there should be
cross-talk between them through faculty interactions and
cross-listed courses. This synergistic environment extends be-
yond the confines of single institutions through collaborative

big data grants such as the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation initiative between NYU, UC-
Berkeley and the University of Washington, which focus on
‘championing education and training in data science at all lev-
els’ [25].

Many of these programs are addressing the challenge of
training domain experts in hard analytical skills while simul-
taneously training computational researchers in the necessary
domain knowledge. While there are diverse opinions about how
to update bioinformatics curricula to stay relevant in the era of
big data, one must also remember that enacting those updates
and training at the interface of multiple fields is inherently diffi-
cult. Graduate training in bioinformatics is difficult because it is
a rapidly evolving field, and many new graduate students come
from one field of strength (i.e. computer science or biology), ra-
ther than an interdisciplinary one. Abeln et al. [39] address this
with a fresh perspective on interdisciplinary education. Their
novel MSc program housed between VU University Amsterdam
and the University of Amsterdam allows students to choose a
track in bioinformatics or systems biology [39]. At the start of
their program, the required courses are taken alongside ‘conver-
sion courses’, which aim to bring students up to speed in two of
three areas, wherever they may be lacking expertise (molecular
biology, mathematics and programming). Throughout their pro-
gram, the classes have interdisciplinary projects that reinforce
concepts across the disciplines. Below, we propose additions to
current bioinformatics curricula, and to accommodate the
growing body of knowledge that students need to learn in the
era of big data, these additions may be difficult to fit into al-
ready challenging curricula. However, innovative approaches to
interdisciplinary education, such as the one proposed by Abeln
et al., are one way that programs may adapt their curricula to
train students more broadly in the big data deluge.

Additions to existing curricula
An important question to consider now is whether current bio-
informatics training programs are adjusting their curricula to
incorporate big data challenges. Individuals with the ability
to analyze, organize and foster discoveries from immense
volumes of data are valuable in today’s economy and will be-
come more so in the future. According to a report filed by
McKinsey and Company where they studied the economic im-
pact of big data on different economic sectors, there will be a
potential shortfall of 140 000–190 000 people for positions requir-
ing ‘deep analytical skills’ by 2018 [4]. Many bioinformatics pro-
grams were established before big data became a prominent
area of focus. These programs may need to refresh some as-
pects of their curriculum to stay competitive among other
programs and to remain competitive for funding sources. While
many aspects of data science curricula now represent import-
ant areas of bioinformatics,
the modern bioinformatics
researcher should have extensive knowledge of biology, which
is likely to extend beyond that covered in existing data science
curricula. Bioinformatics students in general benefit
from
an interdisciplinary training program that trains broadly in
computer
statistics, bioinformatics and biology.
Bioinformatics curricula updates should address data unifica-
tion [18], computational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19], mul-
tiple hypothesis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the
data [6].

data-driven discovery solutions (e.g.
Below we include suggested courses on ‘The Flow of
Biological Information’, ‘Statistical Challenges of Big Data’ and
‘Computational Challenges of Big Data’. These hypothetical
courses highlight some of the most necessary biology, computa-
tional and statistical knowledge needed by the next generation
of bioinformaticists for the era of big data and provide a frame-
work for the redesign of program curricula. While we suggest
these as courses that may be added to existing curricula, these
skills may also be acquired through required coursework, elect-
ives,
journal clubs and online resources. These suggested
courses include topic areas that should be covered in a bioinfor-
matics curriculum, but more work is needed to implement and
assess the impact of training program updates. As noted in
Magana et al. [40], while the bioinformatics community has
broadly implemented curricula, little is known about the effect-
iveness of these curricula on learning objectives. As with any
graduate curriculum,
it should be tailored to the student’s
strengths and deficiencies to enable the greatest chance for
success.

To remain at the forefront of bioinformatics education, cur-
ricula should be updated on an annual or biennial basis. Course
instructors should adjust curricula as necessary based on ad-
vancements in the field. They should also engage with current
students in their classes to assess class activity and topic use-
fulness, obtain class evaluations during and after the class
ends, as well as stay in contact with class/program alumni to
discuss the impact of the class on their success after graduation
[41]. Additionally, it is helpful in an interdisciplinary program
like bioinformatics to have regular faculty meetings across the
disciplines in the core curricula to communicate how the pro-
gram curricula should evolve as a whole based on advance-
ments in their respective fields.

curricula.

Suggested additional course: The Flow of
Biological Information
While a broad overview of molecular biology is most thoroughly
accomplished through a series of graduate courses in biology, it
is not always feasible to incorporate a lengthy course series into
existing
Stanford
University, in 1998, published five areas of competence for bio-
informatics training: biology, computer science, statistics, eth-
ics and core bioinformatics [35].
In a recent update [42],
Professor Altman said, ‘For biomedicine, there is little doubt
that the best data scientists will be those who understand the
special features and challenges in biology or medicine, and thus
make assumptions and approximations that are valid and not
fatal’.

Professor Russ Altman of

The large-scale data being generated in biology measure
genome sequences, gene expression, protein signaling and
other areas of information flow through complex biological sys-
tems. We describe a blended molecular biology and genetics
course entitled ‘The Flow of Biological Information’, which
would serve as a primer on the areas of biology that are fre-
quently encountered by bioinformatics students (Figure 1). This
course is intended to provide students with an understanding
of the measurements behind their data. Professor Lawrence
Hunter from the University of Colorado Denver emphasized the
importance of this knowledge when he said [42], ‘Insights into
the idiosyncrasies of instruments such as mass spectrometers
and hybridization arrays have led to dramatic improvements in

informatics methods not available to those who treat data as a
“given”’. In addition to developing an understanding of the
underlying experimental platforms, this course will familiarize
students with the data formats and skills necessary for data
wrangling in this domain [43].

Each week covers an important type of biology information
storage and processing. The conceptual lectures are paired with
a lab in which the students analyze data relevant to the week’s
lecture using recently developed methods. During lectures
focused on each type of information, students will be exposed
to the types of data that are commonly used to measure these
systems. To effectively carry out these labs, students should
have a strong programming background when coming into the
course. A common theme throughout the course should be the
data and knowledge biases associated with each type of
information.

The course is organized around key types of information
transfer, organized into three modules. The first module is
Transmission Between Generations (heredity, molecular gen-
etics—mitosis/meiosis, epigenetics) with lectures in DNA (struc-
ture and DNA as an information storage medium), mitosis (how
genomes are copied, errors that can arise), meiosis (genetic vari-
ation at the population level) and epigenetics (inheritance can
occur beyond the level of nucleic acid sequence). Example labs
relating to these lecture topics include aligning reads to a gen-
ome (e.g. Bowtie [44]), identification of somatic variations in
cancer (e.g. apply MuTect [45]), 1000 genomes/variant annota-
tions (e.g. [46]) and bisulfite sequencing alignment (e.g. [47]).
The second module covers Transmission Within the Cell [epi-
genetics, transcriptional regulation (mRNA, miRNA and siRNA)
and translational regulation (protein, phosphorylation)] and has
lectures on epigenetics (epigenetic marks as a means to define
cell-lineages), regulation of transcription (transcription factor
binding, motifs, ChIP-seq), steady-state mRNA levels (how
genes are expressed to mRNA), noncoding RNA (RNAi, miRNA,
siRNA, lncRNA and their role in regulation) and proteomics
(translational and posttranslational regulation). The last mod-
ule is Transmission Between Cells [instant messaging (small
molecule signaling), recognition of nonself (immunology) and

talking with others (quorum sensing)] and discusses small mol-
ecule signaling (neurotransmitters, etc), recognition of nonself
and quorum sensing. The course is capped by a student-defined
final project through which they integrate two or more data
types covered within the course.

Suggested additional course: Statistical
Challenges of Big Data
For example, the uncertainty around results represents an im-
portant and fast-moving area. In an interview about the chal-
lenges of big data, Michael I. Jordon from the University of
California, Berkeley, states, ‘We have to have error bars around
all our predictions. That is something that’s missing in much of
the current machine learning literature’ [48]. He likens this to
bridge building: ‘If I have no principles, and I build thousands
of bridges without any actual science, lots of them will fall
down, and great disasters will occur’ [48]. He states that predic-
tion error bars will take years of research, highlighting one rea-
son why bioinformatics education in big data analysis is
important and will require curricula to be updated as the field
evolves.

Analyzing big data presents additional statistical challenges.
In such data, even infrequent observations are expected to be
frequent. As The Whitlams’ song Up Against the Wall notes,
‘She was one in a million, yeah; So there’s five more, just in
New South Wales’ [49]. In a data set with a trillion observations,
we expect 1000 ‘one in a billion’ events. Experiments to evaluate
results from the analysis of big data need to take this into
account.

This course is organized around principles of experimental
design, hypothesis testing and machine learning and is paired
each week with an associated lab that reinforces the concepts
learned during the week’s lectures (Figure 2). This course would
include motivating examples from recent literature and would
use data sets for data types covered in the transmission of infor-
mation course. A strong emphasis would be placed on the crit-
ical evaluation of potential discoveries, with specific training

toward recognizing knowledge or data biases that could lead to
spurious discoveries.

The first key module is Experimental Design (parameter op-
timization, blinded evaluations, independence) and has lectures
on hyperparameter optimization (parameter sweep), method
evaluation (permutation testing, blinded evaluations) and key
assumptions of methods (independence, naı¨ve Bayes). Example
labs for these lectures include a parameter sweep for an appro-
priate ‘c’ using support vector machines (SVM), evaluation to
see if this SVM works better than random and using a naı¨ve
Bayes classifier to combine simulated data with nonindepend-
ence and/or random data (which is worse?). The second module
is based on Hypothesis Testing (parametric, nonparametric,
multiple testing) and features lecture topics on parametric stat-
istical methods, nonparametric statistics and multiple hypoth-
esis testing (good and bad uses, Type I and II error). The last
module focuses on machine learning (data-driven model con-
struction, regularization), with lectures on unsupervised meth-
ods (clustering, PCA), supervised methods (regression and
classification), semi-supervised methods (classification), regu-
larization (lasso, ridge, elastic net) and artificial intelligence.
The conclusion of the course is focused on a student project to
use all of the knowledge gained from the course to analyze a
new data set, extract novel insights and analyze the validity of
the results.

Suggested additional course: Computational
Challenges of Big Data
Analyzing big data present new computational challenges.
These data may need to be analyzed in a distributed manner,
the analyses performed should be highly reproducible to allow
for thorough evaluation of potential biases, and results need to
be presented as effective visual summaries. Our proposed
course touches on each of these areas (Figure 3).

To address the challenge of feasibility, we introduce stu-
dents to cloud computing. Vasant Dhar, Professor and Director
of the Center for Business Analytics at NYU’s Stern School of
Business, recently highlighted cloud computing and distributed
computing as necessary components of a data science educa-
tion [50]. To address reproducibility, we introduce workflow
automation, version control and unit testing [51–53]. For visual-
ization, we use the modern javascript library, d3.js, to teach
students to make high-content visualizations of complex data
sets.

While each of these topics is large enough to be covered in
an individual course, the emphasis of this course is on provid-
ing students with the groundwork necessary to identify the ap-
propriate courses and focus areas for a given challenge. The
laboratory components of this course would be conducted en-
tirely using cloud computing resources (e.g. through Amazon’s
EC2). This would provide students with efficient solutions for
multiple types of data, expertise in managing a cloud comput-
ing system and an important background in conveying results
to a broader audience.

The first module is Feasibility (distributed problem solving
and cloud computing) with lectures in cloud computing (what
is it, how to use it and cost drivers) and distributed problem-
solving. Example labs include creating a cloud instance and
performing an analysis, implementing a parameter sweep/em-
barrassingly parallel process and read mapping across many
reads or building a model with many examples. The second
module focuses on Reproducibility (shell scripting, workflow
automation and unit testing) and contains lectures on workflow
automation in biology (make, galaxy, etc), version control (git,
github, mercurial and bitbucket) and unit testing (unit test
library for a programming language of choice). The last module
is Visual Analytics (building meaningful visualizations, testing
visualizations), including topics on D3 visualization, making
visualizations useful and unit testing for javascript. The course
is capped by a project in which the students integrate what

they have learned in this course with the biology and statistics
components of the curriculum. The final project uses cloud
computing to do an analysis that is infeasible on a single ma-
chine using an automated workflow stored in a version control
system and to visualize the results in an informative way.

Conclusion
We are living in a data revolution, where four dimensions de-
fine big data: volume, velocity, variety and veracity [54]. Because
of the complexity of biomedical big data, there is a growing
need to produce bioinformatics professionals that are capable
of processing, analyzing and interpreting big data. While big
data bring great promise, there are many associated challenges
with it as well. There is a need to update bioinformatics curric-
ula to address these challenges, which requires us to develop
curricula that provide the appropriate skillset for analyzing big
data along with the knowledge to extract and determine the val-
idity of key findings. Curricula updates should address data uni-
fication [18], computational and storage limitations [6, 18, 19],
multiple hypothesis testing [6] and bias and confounding in the
data [6]. We have also proposed three courses in ‘The Flow of
Biological Information’, ‘Statistical Challenges of Big Data’ and
‘Computational Challenges of Big Data’. These courses feature
the most necessary biology, computational and statistical
knowledge needed for students to graduate as well-informed
bioinformaticians in the era of big data. The courses may be
added to current bioinformatics curricula or may serve as a
jumping off point for the inclusion of new lectures into courses
already being taught. Additionally, many schools now offer data
science programs. The coursework housed in these programs
may facilitate educational updates to bioinformatics programs
through the cross-listing of relevant courses and other scholarly
activities. As Welch et al. [33] showed, companies are now look-
ing for bioinformaticians who are able to work effectively with
big data, and thus, we must augment bioinformatics curricula

Key Points
• The phrase ‘big data’ has emerged as a catchall for data
and information that is so big that it is difﬁcult to store,
transport, manipulate, analyze and interpret.

• There is a growing need to produce bioinformatics pro-
fessionals who are capable of processing, analyzing and
interpreting big data.

• We propose updates to current bioinformatics curricula
that include topics such as data uniﬁcation, computa-
tional and storage limitations, multiple hypothesis
testing and bias and confounding in the data.

• We have also proposed three courses in ‘The Flow of
‘Statistical Challenges of Big

Biological
Data’ and ‘Computational Challenges of Big Data’.
