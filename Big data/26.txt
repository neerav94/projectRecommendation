Abstract  -  Big  Data  concerns  with  large-volume, 
complex,  growing  data 
in  multiple  and 
autonomous  sources.  Data  storage  and  Data  collection 
has  become  more  complex.  Big  Data  is  now  rapidly 
expanding  in  all  science  and  engineering  domains 
including  physical,  biological  and  biomedical  sciences. 
This  paper  presents  a  k_means  algorithm 
that 
characterizes  the  features  of  the  Big  Data  revolution, 
and  proposes  a  Big  Data  processing  model  from  the 
Data mining  perspective.  This paper  provides  the most 
relevant  and  most  accurate  social  sensing  feedback  to 
better understand our society at real time with big data 
technologies..

conditions such as missing or uncertain values. 
 
2. Theories and Challenges   
 
System  analysis  is  the  process  of  examining  an  existing 
system  of  methodology  with  intend  of  improving  it 
through better procedure and methods after analyzing the 
requirements of the task to be performed. The next step is 
to  analyze  the  problem  and  understand  its  context.  The 
first  activity  in  the  phase  is  studying  the  existing  system 
and  other  is  to  understand  the  requirements  and  domain 
of  the  new  system.  Both  the  activities  are  equally 
important, but the first activity serves as a basis of giving 
the functional specifications and then successful design of 
the proposed system. 
 
2.1 HACE Theorem 
 
The  Existing  system  presents  a  HACE  theorem  that 
characterizes  the  features  of  the  Big  Data  revolution,  and 
proposes  a  Big  Data  processing  model,  from  the  data 
mining  perspective.  This  data-driven  model  involves 
demand-driven  aggregation  of 
information  sources, 
mining  and  analysis,  user  interest  modeling,  and  security 
and privacy considerations. 
 
2.2 Challenges of Tier Architecture 
 
The  challenges  at  Tier-I  focus  on  data  accessing  and 
arithmetic  computing  procedures.  The  challenges  at  Tier-
II center on semantics and domain knowledge for different 
Big  Data  applications.  At  Tier-III,  the  data  mining 
challenges  concentrate  on  algorithm  designs  in  tackling 
the difficulties raised by the Big Data volumes, distributed 
data  distributions,  and  by  complex  and  dynamic  data 
characteristics.

2.3 Clustering with Big Data 
 
K  means  algorithm  is  one  of  the  clustering  algorithms. 
Clustering  is  a  collection  of  objects  which  are  “similar” 
between  them  and  are 
  “dissimilar”  to  the  objects 
belonging to other cluster. By using java program the user 
gets  the  input  based  on  that  it  performs  operation  and 
group  the  objects  which  is  used  for  the  analysis  task  for 
the  project.  The  technique  which  is  used  in  this  paper 
known as Clustering concepts in data mining  to avoid the 
problem  of  the  noisy  data  in  the  big  data  project.  Every 
day,  2.5  quintillion  bytes  of  data  are  created  and  90 
percent  of  the  data  in  the  world  today  were  produced 
within  the  past  two  years.  The  world  will  generate  50 
times the amount of information and 75 times the number 
of 
information 
Technology personnel to manage. It will grow less than 1.5 
times. 

information  contains  by  200  while 

3. System Architecture and Design  
 
In System Architecture, the user wants to gather data from 
the  any  data  source  then  preprocess  the  data.  Then  it 
stores in the dataset which here act as MySQL database. It 
uses  the  technique  called  clustering  with  k_means 
algorithm  and  gets  the  extract  data  or  knowledge  for  the 
future analysis  of task. Therefore this algorithm is mostly 
useful  for  the  user  to  get  the  extract  information  while 
having the large amount of data.

4. System Implementation 
In the implementation program, we take eight numbers of 
elements then the number of cluster is three, so that it will

calculate  the  mean  value  between  neighbor  values  and 
place  in  three  clusters.  This  is  the  process  of  K_means 
algorithm.  Finally  we  get  the  values  for  further  analysis 
using  clustering  in  data  mining.  So  this  will  help  us  to 
process the big data without any noisy data for the project. 
Then  the  user  wants  to  gather  data  from  the  any  data 
source  then  preprocess  the  data  which  gathered  by  the 
user, then store it in the dataset which here act as MySQL 
database.  By  using  the  technique  called  clustering  with 
k_means algorithm gets the extract data or knowledge for 
the future analysis task.

Abstract  -  Big  Data  concerns  with  large-volume, 
complex,  growing  data 
in  multiple  and 
autonomous  sources.  Data  storage  and  Data  collection 
has  become  more  complex.  Big  Data  is  now  rapidly 
expanding  in  all  science  and  engineering  domains 
including  physical,  biological  and  biomedical  sciences. 
This  paper  presents  a  k_means  algorithm 
that 
characterizes  the  features  of  the  Big  Data  revolution, 
and  proposes  a  Big  Data  processing  model  from  the 
Data mining  perspective.  This paper  provides  the most 
relevant  and  most  accurate  social  sensing  feedback  to 
better understand our society at real time with big data 
technologies.. 

environments  often  result  in  data  with  complicated 
conditions such as missing or uncertain values. 
 
2. Theories and Challenges   
 
System  analysis  is  the  process  of  examining  an  existing 
system  of  methodology  with  intend  of  improving  it 
through better procedure and methods after analyzing the 
requirements of the task to be performed. The next step is 
to  analyze  the  problem  and  understand  its  context.  The 
first  activity  in  the  phase  is  studying  the  existing  system 
and  other  is  to  understand  the  requirements  and  domain 
of  the  new  system.  Both  the  activities  are  equally 
important, but the first activity serves as a basis of giving 
the functional specifications and then successful design of 
the proposed system. 
 
2.1 HACE Theorem 
 
The  Existing  system  presents  a  HACE  theorem  that 
characterizes  the  features  of  the  Big  Data  revolution,  and 
proposes  a  Big  Data  processing  model,  from  the  data 
mining  perspective.  This  data-driven  model  involves 
demand-driven  aggregation  of 
information  sources, 
mining  and  analysis,  user  interest  modeling,  and  security 
and privacy considerations. 
 
2.2 Challenges of Tier Architecture 
 
The  challenges  at  Tier-I  focus  on  data  accessing  and 
arithmetic  computing  procedures.  The  challenges  at  Tier-
II center on semantics and domain knowledge for different 
Big  Data  applications.  At  Tier-III,  the  data  mining 
challenges  concentrate  on  algorithm  designs  in  tackling 
the difficulties raised by the Big Data volumes, distributed 
data  distributions,  and  by  complex  and  dynamic  data 
characteristics. 
 
2.3 k_means Algorithm 
 
The  proposed  system  based  on  clustering  algorithm.  
Clustering  is  a  collection  of  objects  which  are  “similar” 
between  them  and  are  “dissimilar”  to  the  objects 
belonging to other cluster by k_means algorithm. It is one 
the  exclusive  clustering  algorithm  and  is  one  of  the 
simplest  unsupervised  learning  algorithm  that  solve  the 
well known clustering problem, which is used to group the 
similar  objects  in  one  cluster  and  dissimilar  objects  in 

and 

diverse 

dimensionality

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Big  Data  starts  with  large  volume  and  clustering  using 
K_means algorithm. It seeks to explore more complex and 
  Huge  data  with 
evolving  relationships  among  data. 
heterogeneous 
has 
autonomous  sources  with  distributed  and  decentralized 
control in complex and evolving relationships. So the noise 
is one of the problems. In this paper, we group the objects 
by  using  clustering  which  is  similar  to  one  cluster  and  is 
dissimilar  group  in  to  other  cluster.  To  overcome  this 
problem,  we  use  k_means  algorithm  by  implementing 
using java programming language.  
 
1.1 Big Data 
 
The most fundamental challenge for Big Data applications 
is  to  explore  the  large  volumes  of  data  and  extract  useful 
information  or  knowledge  for  future  actions.  In  many 
situations,  the  knowledge  extraction  process  has  to  be 
very  efficient  and  close  to  real  time  because  storing  all 
observed  data  is  nearly  infeasible.  Sometimes 
large 
amount of data is beyond the software tools to manage.  
 
1.2 Noise and Error 
 
In other situation, privacy concerns with noise and errors. 
These  can  be  interested  into  the  data  to  produce  altered 
data copies. At the data level, the autonomous information 
sources  and 
the  data  collection

useful  to  the  organization.  The  main  objective  of  the 
feasibility  study  is  to  test  the  technical,  operational  and 
economical  feasibility  for  adding  new  modules  and 
debugging  old  running  system.  All  system  is  feasible  if 
they  are  unlimited  resources  and  infinite  time.  There  are 
aspects  in  the  feasibility  study  portion  of  the  preliminary 
investigations  on  operational,  technical  and  economical 
feasibility. 

 

2.3 Clustering with Big Data 
 
K  means  algorithm  is  one  of  the  clustering  algorithms. 
Clustering  is  a  collection  of  objects  which  are  “similar” 
between  them  and  are 
  “dissimilar”  to  the  objects 
belonging to other cluster. By using java program the user 
gets  the  input  based  on  that  it  performs  operation  and 
group  the  objects  which  is  used  for  the  analysis  task  for 
the  project.  The  technique  which  is  used  in  this  paper 
known as Clustering concepts in data mining  to avoid the 
problem  of  the  noisy  data  in  the  big  data  project.  Every 
day,  2.5  quintillion  bytes  of  data  are  created  and  90 
percent  of  the  data  in  the  world  today  were  produced 
within  the  past  two  years.  The  world  will  generate  50 
times the amount of information and 75 times the number 
of 
information 
Technology personnel to manage. It will grow less than 1.5 
times. 

information  contains  by  200  while 

3. System Architecture and Design  
 
In System Architecture, the user wants to gather data from 
the  any  data  source  then  preprocess  the  data.  Then  it 
stores in the dataset which here act as MySQL database. It 
uses  the  technique  called  clustering  with  k_means 
algorithm  and  gets  the  extract  data  or  knowledge  for  the 
future analysis  of task. Therefore this algorithm is mostly 
useful  for  the  user  to  get  the  extract  information  while 
having the large amount of data. 

Fig -1: System Architecture 
 
4. System Implementation 
In the implementation program, we take eight numbers of 
elements then the number of cluster is three, so that it will

calculate  the  mean  value  between  neighbor  values  and 
place  in  three  clusters.  This  is  the  process  of  K_means 
algorithm.  Finally  we  get  the  values  for  further  analysis 
using  clustering  in  data  mining.  So  this  will  help  us  to 
process the big data without any noisy data for the project. 
Then  the  user  wants  to  gather  data  from  the  any  data 
source  then  preprocess  the  data  which  gathered  by  the 
user, then store it in the dataset which here act as MySQL 
database.  By  using  the  technique  called  clustering  with 
k_means algorithm gets the extract data or knowledge for 
the future analysis task.

3. CONCLUSIONS 
 
We regard Big Data as an emerging trend and the need for 
big  data  mining  is  arising  in  all  Science  and  Engineering 
domains. With big data technologies, we will hopefully be 
able  to  provide  most  relevant  and  most  accurate  social 
sensing  feedback  to  better  understand  our  society  at  real 
time.  We  can  further  stimulate  the  participation  of  the 
public audiences in the data production circle for societal 
and economical events. The era of big data has arrived.
