Abstract

In many countries, a long-term registered electronic medical database has been established by public authorities, 
which could be used to investigate the epidemiology of orthopedic injuries or degenerative disorders. Three basic 
epidemiological  study designs could be applied to a big-data for healthcare to study orthopedic medicine: cross-
sectional study, retrospective case-control study, and retrospective cohort study. From the viewpoint of epidemiology, 
nationwide descriptive estimations of orthopedic injuries or disorders presented as the point prevalence (or incidence) 
with the 95% confidence interval and subsequent analysis of risk factors (or prognostic factors) evaluated by various 
statistic methods are valuable to policymakers when considering the redistribution of medical and social resources.

Short Communication

In  2012,  the  US  government  unveiled  the  “Big  Data”  initiative, 
with  $200  million  committed  to  research  across  several  agencies 
[1].  Integrating  “big  data”  science  into  the  practice  of  epidemiology 
has  been  recommended  because  the  unquestionable  reality  of  21st 
century  epidemiology  is  a  tsunami  of  data  spanning  the  spectrum 
of  genomic,  molecular,  clinical,  epidemiologic,  environmental,  and 
digital  information  [2].  In  many  countries,  a  long-term  registered 
electronic medical database has been established by public authorities, 
which  could  be  used  to  investigate  the  descriptive  epidemiology  of 
orthopedics, such as orthopedic injuries or degenerative disorders, in 
order to analyze the potential risk factors of these orthopedic issues 
and to predict their future consequences (which could be thought of as 
analytic epidemiology of orthopedics). 

The number of students and disciplines requiring basic instruction 
in  epidemiologic  methods  is  growing.  Many  approaches  to  teaching 
epidemiology generally start with labeling key concepts and then move 
on to explain them [3]. It is important for an orthopedic researcher to 
learn some modern biostatistics to deal with nationwide big data. For 
example, three basic epidemiological study designs can be applied to 
an existing big-data for healthcare to study orthopedic medicine: cross-
sectional  study  [4-9],  retrospective  case-control  study  [10-12],  and 
retrospective cohort study [13-15]. Methods to estimate the prevalence 
or incidence of some orthopedic disorders or injuries, to evaluate their 
associated factors, to select other comparable groups and to use some 
suitable statistical models are shown in Table 1. 

Based on our restricted experience, the descriptive epidemiology 
of orthopedic trauma could use big data such as a nationwide health 
insurance databank to calculate prevalences [4,6,7] or incidences [5,8-
10]  with  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs),  and  analytic  epidemiology 
of orthopedics could be also performed. All the enrolled cases could 
be  divided  into  several  subgroups  for  comparison  [11,12,14,15],  but 
a  control  group  may  be  randomly  selected  from  the  other  normal 
population by a matched method [13]. In a retrospective data analysis, 
the odds ratio (OR) with the 95% CI is evaluated [11-13], usually by a 
binominal logistic regression (LR) model or an innovative multi-level 
logistic  regression  (MLLR)  model  [11,12].  In  a  retrospective  cohort 
data analysis, the relative risk (RR) with the 95% CI is also evaluated 
[10,13-15], usually by a traditional survival analysis method, although 
an  unconventional  Poisson  regression  model  [14,15]  can  be  used  in
