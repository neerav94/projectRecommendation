Abstract.  The use of smartphones has increased recently, and because of the 
Global Positioning System (GPS) feature of smartphones, various services have 
also  been  increasing  in  number.  However,  the  GPS  function  in  smartphones 
consumes  a  large  amount  of  battery  power,  a  problem  for  which  several 
methods  have  been  studied,  and  that  has  yet  to  be  solved.  In  this  paper,  we 
study the ability to utilize the cycle time required to collect GPS data in order to 
reduce  battery  consumption  of  mobile  devices.  Then,  by  reducing  battery 
consumption, we expect this method to become an efficient way for collecting 
data [8].

One of the biggest challenges for 2013 in the field of Information & Communication 
Technology (ICT) is big data. Big data is a technique in which the atypical data set or 
fixed form of a large amount, to extract value from these data beyond the capacity of 
data collection ∙ save ∙ Management ∙ analysis of database management tools existing, 
to  analyze  the  results.  As  a  result,  interest  in  big  data-related  industries  has  been 
increasing.  Consequently,  it  is  expected  that  interest  in  big  data  from  global  ICT 
companies at home and abroad will grow significantly, as will the related market. Big 
data market worldwide is expected to reach $9.7 billion in 2013, which represents an 
increase  of  42%  from  the  $6.8  billion  reported  in  2012.  Figure  1  is  a  graph  of  the

2      Experimental Design 

In this study, we used a smartphone Application that has a function that allows a user 
to enter his or her information and saves it to obtain GPS data. The Application is a 
system  that  stores  the  GPS  data  of  users  and  a  large  amount  of  other  information. 
After the user executes the GPS function of the Application, the Application collects 
GPS data until it is finished. In this paper, we analyzed according to the cycle time by 
measuring the battery consumption utilized to collect GPS data [6]. The time period 
was set as shown in Table 1. Depending on the cycle time, GPS data is accumulated, 
GPS is completed, and the data is eventually stored as single data. 
 

3        Results 

Experiment measurements of the battery consumption of mobile equipment were as 
shown  in  Table  1.  The  experiment  was  carried  out  for  30  minutes,  and  the  total 
distance was 2 km. Figure 3 is a diagram that shows a comparison graph of battery 
consumption due to the cycle time.

substantially matches the accuracy of the GPS data and the actual data. However, we

difference in the exact GPS data and the actual data, and the battery consumption is 
within  acceptable  levels.  At  one  minute,  three  minutes,  and  five  minutes,  accuracy 
falls significantly, but battery consumption is low. These results indicate that the 30-
second time period provided the best results. 

4        Conclusion 

In this paper, we performed an analysis of the results obtained from experiments to 
minimize the battery consumption that occurs by using the GPS function of mobile 
devices. By reducing the power consumption of the GPS sensor that collects big data, 
the intent is to support data collection more efficiently [5]. In future studies, we will 
present how to reduce the power consumption of the GPS under other conditions that 
influence  the  value  of  the  GPS  and  time  period,  in  order  to  obtain  higher  GPS 
reliability.
