Governance  is  needed  to  control  the  service  lifecycle 
(as  a  start)  and  then  to  begin  to  hammer  out  policies 
and  procedures  that  must  be  followed  in  order  to 
develop, publish, and consume services (Adrian). 
  
Wang  (2013)  adopted  the  SOA  for  the  analysis  and 
design  of  business  processes  such  as  service 
identification,  specification  and  realization.  He  also 
used  top-down,  bottom-up  and  meet-in-the-middle  to 
identify the required service. The service specification 
helps to align business and technology to improve the 
efficiency of the firm.   
 
Yavari  et  al.  (2013)    proposed  a  method  named 
Service-Oriented  SysFailRate  Measurement 
for 
measuring  the  failure  rate  of  the  system  in  service-
oriented architecture using fuzzy logic. In this system, 
incomplete  description  of  a 
lack  of 
integration, incorrect format, and being out of the pre-
determined  time  out  factors  were  used  to  measuring 
the  failure  rate.  Testing  rests  demonstrated  that  this 
approach

Bakar et al (2013) explored the important factors on to 
implement  Service  Oriented  Architecture/Service 
Oriented  Enterprise  Architecture  (SOEA)  in  the  firm 
and  recognized  the  maturity  models  used  to  measure 
the architecture effectiveness in the organization. 
 
Zdravković  et  al.  (2007)  designed  an  architectural 
model which concentrated more towards technological 
infrastructure  focused  on  migration  from  legacy  ERP 
functions  of 
to  SOA-based 
environment.  
 
Fazlollahtabar  et  al.  (2013)  developed  a  framework 
towards  serving  distributed  communication  based  on 
real  time  behaviors  of  service.  They  also  suggest  a 
service  oriented  framework  for  ERP  and  Decision 
Support System (DSS) of manufacturing organizations. 
they  presented  business  process 
Furthermore,

enterprises to improve the firm’s performance. 
 
Zadeh  et  al.  (2013)  carried  out  an  analysis  of 
Enterprise Resource Planning versus Service Oriented 
Architecture  in  small  to  medium-sized  firms.  This 
study  showed  that  it  is  easy  to  understand  at  the  first 
glance  that  SOA  capabilities  will  prepare  better 
infrastructure  than  object  oriented  systems  such  as 
ERP.  
 
Alwadain  et  al.  (2011)  suggest  that  SOA  is  needed 
because  the  modern  enterprise  deals  with  complex 
systems  to  align  the  business  function  with  fast 
growing  technological  changes.  When  enterprise  uses 
SOA,  it  is  called  as  Service-Oriented  Enterprise 
Architecture  (SOEA).    It  transforms  the  enterprise  in 

techniques 

terms  of  business  process  engineering  and  agility  for 
the  organization’s  competitive  advantage.  In  order  to 
support  decision-making  and  ever-changing  business 
needs,  SOEA  is  essential  to  achieve  firm’s  business 
objectives.  BIG  DATA  systems  help  create  business 
value  through  ERP  transformation  by  means  of 
increased velocity and agility, improved reliability and 
support  as  well  as  enhanced  cost  efficiency.  SOEA 
strategies  also  support  to  maximize  the  transforming 
efforts  from  the  legacy  systems  to  new  ERP  systems. 
This transformation will take full advantage of return-
on-investment (ROI) and Total Cost Ownership (TCO) 
in terms of implementing cloud ERP (CERP) projects. 
 
As highlighted by Galinium and Shahbaz (2009, p.16), 
legacy  systems  are  applications  which  are  based  on 
mainframe  or  client-server  application  designs,  such 
as  Cloud  ERP,  supply  chain  management  (SCM)  or 
Supplier-Relationship Management (SRM) in order to 
run  the  business  process  to  make  appropriate  ROI. 
Bisbal  (1999)  suggest  that  organizations  has  to  keep 
original  data  and  functionality  while  it  transforms  to 
new  system  from  the  legacy  system  because  the 
legacy  systems  is  very  important  as  it  has  the 
organization’s information flow.  
 
SOEA is essential, in particular for implementing BIG 
DATA  systems  such  as  Cloud  ERP  because  the  firm 
needs  to  collaborate  third  party  vendors  to  create 
customer  value,  maximize  the  profit  and  explore  new 
business 
other  multinational 
organizations globally (Shu and Chuang, 2010). Cloud 
ERP is essential as it create new services without any 
financial  constraints  such  as  server  cost  and  high 
maintain  capabilities  and  allows  firms  to  concentrate 
its core business functions. 
 
SOEA  is  a  part  of  technology  perspective  and  the 
overall  aim  is  to  restructure  the  entire  firm  and  to 
synchronize  the  firm’s  vision  and  needs  which  can 
drive technology towards the organizational goals.     
 
SOEA  is  greatly  changing  the  way  that  IT  vendors 
build and use BIG DATA applications  such as  Cloud 
ERP (CERP) because all the broken part in the legacy 
systems  are  considered  as  layers  that  consists  of 
services and components to be reused.  
 
Although there were many articles published so far in 
SOA,  there  is  still  a  lack  of  empirical  evidence  for 
factors  implementing  BIG  DATA  systems  such  as 
cloud  ERP  (CERP).  This  study  would  be  very  useful 
for academicians and practitioners who intend to write 
articles on SOA in near future. 
 
Issues in Legacy Systems 
The following are the issues related to legacy system: 
Very close linkage between systems  modules; Design 
time sharing of semantics; Pre-defined set of users and

strategies  also  support  to  maximize  the  transforming 
efforts  from  the  legacy  systems  to  new  ERP  systems. 
This transformation will take full advantage of return-
on-investment (ROI) and Total Cost Ownership (TCO) 
in terms of implementing cloud ERP (CERP) projects. 
 
As highlighted by Galinium and Shahbaz (2009, p.16), 
legacy  systems  are  applications  which  are  based  on 
mainframe  or  client-server  application  designs,  such 
as  Cloud  ERP,  supply  chain  management  (SCM)  or 
Supplier-Relationship Management (SRM) in order to 
run  the  business  process  to  make  appropriate  ROI. 
Bisbal  (1999)  suggest  that  organizations  has  to  keep 
original  data  and  functionality  while  it  transforms  to 
new  system  from  the  legacy  system  because  the 
legacy  systems  is  very  important  as  it  has  the 
organization’s information flow.  
 
SOEA is essential, in particular for implementing BIG 
DATA  systems  such  as  Cloud  ERP  because  the  firm 
needs  to  collaborate  third  party  vendors  to  create 
customer  value,  maximize  the  profit  and  explore  new 
business 
other  multinational 
organizations globally (Shu and Chuang, 2010). Cloud 
ERP is essential as it create new services without any 
financial  constraints  such  as  server  cost  and  high 
maintain  capabilities  and  allows  firms  to  concentrate 
its core business functions. 
 
SOEA  is  a  part  of  technology  perspective  and  the 
overall  aim  is  to  restructure  the  entire  firm  and  to 
synchronize  the  firm’s  vision  and  needs  which  can 
drive technology towards the organizational goals.     
 
SOEA  is  greatly  changing  the  way  that  IT  vendors 
build and use BIG DATA applications  such as  Cloud 
ERP (CERP) because all the broken part in the legacy 
systems  are  considered  as  layers  that  consists  of 
services and components to be reused.  
 
Although there were many articles published so far in 
SOA,  there  is  still  a  lack  of  empirical  evidence  for 
factors  implementing  BIG  DATA  systems  such  as 
cloud  ERP  (CERP).  This  study  would  be  very  useful 
for academicians and practitioners who intend to write 
articles on SOA in near future.

Because  of  day-to-day  change  in  technology,  the 
organization  is  expecting  management  change  in 
terms  of  business  process  analysis  to  come  up  with 
data  definitions  and  standard  schemas.  Furthermore, 
the design and architectural model  need to be built-in 
so  that  the  technical  gap  is  narrowed  to  help  vendors 
to  minimize  the  implementation  issues,  in  particular 
BIG  DATA  systems  such  as  ERP.  The  migration 
strategy of SOA is required to minimize cost, increase 
network  security,  reduce  data  redundancy,  gain 
transparency  and  reusability  of  services  from  the 
legacy systems. 
 
Potential of Legacy Systems 
This is one of the important factors need to considered 
before  the  migration  stage  is  considered.  During  the 
integration  process, 
services  or 
components  may  not  be  reused  due  to  the  technical 
constraints  or  incompatibility  with  the  operating 
system  of  the  legacy  systems.    The  second  reason  is 
that 
components 
transformation cost may go higher. 
 
SOA Governance 
SOA  governance  is  just  how  a  service  can  be  shared 
according  to  the  set  of  rules  and  policies  which  is 
applicable  to  all  of  the  stake  holders  and  in  turn 
improve  the  business  processes  in  an  organization.  It 
also  helps  improve  visibility  control  of  SOA  in  order 
to  minimize  risk  and  total  cost  ownership  (TCO).  It 
will further align with business goals as well as helps 
streamline the operations of an organization. In terms 
of  enterprises,  it  creates  reusable  network  with 
interoperable services  which is really very helpful for 
vendors in implementing BIG DATA systems such as 
cloud ERP. 
 
Business Process of an Organization 
Business  Processes  in  an  organization  need  to  be 
aligned  across  organizational  divisions,  systems  and 
related  applications  to  streamline  business  operations 
in  order  to  increase  efficiency  of  an  organization. 
Organizations  need  to  correct  and  improve  business 
process  before  automating  them.  Furthermore,  firms 
need  to  standardize  the  business  processes  across  the 
enterprise  to  its  competitive  advantage.  This  will 
further  reduce  the  overall  IT  costs  and  redundancy

Abstract —  The  objective  of  this  study  is  to  find  out  the 
critical  success  factors  that  are  needed  to  implement 
Service-Oriented  Architecture  (SOA) 
in  BIGDATA 
systems  such  as  Cloud  Enterprise  Resource  Planning 
(CERP)  in  India.  A  survey  has  conducted  and  data  has 
been  collected 
from  India, 
particularly  cities  such  as  Chennai,  Mumbai  and  New 
Delhi.  The  data  is  analysed  using  partial  least  square 
(smartPLS) statistical package and results are discussed. 
The  analysed  results  would  be  very  useful 
for 
academicians  and  researchers  who  would  like  to  write 
articles in terms of implementing SOA with BIG DATA 
systems.

II.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

Recent  surveys  have  shown  importance  of  SOA  with 
BIG DATA systems such as Cloud ERP (Neaga & Hai, 
2013; Zadeh et al., 2012; Nicolescu et al., 2007). SOA 
provides a new Business Process Reengineering (BPR) 
which  covers  organizational,  technical  and  project 
aspects  (Alwadain  et  al.,  2011).  Zhang  and  Yang 
(2004)  suggests  a  reengineering  approach  which  will 
restructure  the  legacy  systems  that  leads  to  Service-
Oriented  Architecture  (SOA)  by  considering  the 
business requirements of an organization.  
 
IBM  presented  some  of  their  experience  with  a 
number  of  organizations  which  adopting  SOA  and 
recommended  four  areas  of  adoption  challenges: 
program  management,  organization,  technology,  and 
governance  (Naghmeh  et  al.,  2014).  They  have 
identified  32  most  potential  and  challenging  factors 
for SOA adoption in organizations. 
 
To  succeed  at  Service-Oriented  Architecture  the  first 
step is to educate the organization and do not attempt 
to  introduce  SOA  globally  through  a  big-bang  effort. 
Start with a pilot project that showcases what SOA has 
to offer. Extend the success of your pilot SOA project 
by attempting a slightly bigger or more complex one.

The growth of Business Intelligence Systems (BIS) is 
faster and plays a vital role in almost all organizations 
across  the  world.  The  Service-Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  is  an  improved  approach  which  will  solve  the 
issues  in  legacy  or  old  systems  and  handles  huge 
volumes  of  data  such  as  BIG  DATA  systems.  SOA 
also  ensures  efficiency,  agility,  productivity  and 
integrity  of  an  enterprise  through  multiple  tasks  or 
subsystems 
the  business  processes  of  an 
organization.    The  main  purpose  of  this  study  is  to 
identify  the  important  factors  that  are  needed  to 
implement SOA in BIG DATA systems such as cloud 
ERP (CERP).  
 
Service-oriented  is  splitting  the  problems  into  entity 
and  related  smaller  parts  of  logic  or  service.  Service 
orientation  standard  proposes  the  organization  needs 
to explain businesses tasks, entity, or process into well 
grained  service  granularity  from  the  perspective  of 
IT/IS.  SOA  adoption  is  an  evolutionary  process  and 
there  are  many  reasons  for  SOA  gaining  particular 
interest  towards  the  research  context  (Naghmeh  et  al. 
2014).  SOA  has  been  widely  stimulated  by  computer 
analysts and vendors because of its architecture which 
is  adaptable 
firm’s  business 
expectations  in  a  low  cost  and  just-in-time  (JIT) 
manner.    SOA  lead  numerous  advantage  such  as

Governance  is  needed  to  control  the  service  lifecycle 
(as  a  start)  and  then  to  begin  to  hammer  out  policies 
and  procedures  that  must  be  followed  in  order  to 
develop, publish, and consume services (Adrian). 
  
Wang  (2013)  adopted  the  SOA  for  the  analysis  and 
design  of  business  processes  such  as  service 
identification,  specification  and  realization.  He  also 
used  top-down,  bottom-up  and  meet-in-the-middle  to 
identify the required service. The service specification 
helps to align business and technology to improve the 
efficiency of the firm.   
 
Yavari  et  al.  (2013)    proposed  a  method  named 
Service-Oriented  SysFailRate  Measurement 
for 
measuring  the  failure  rate  of  the  system  in  service-
oriented architecture using fuzzy logic. In this system, 
incomplete  description  of  a 
lack  of 
integration, incorrect format, and being out of the pre-
determined  time  out  factors  were  used  to  measuring 
the  failure  rate.  Testing  rests  demonstrated  that  this 
approach

Architecture.  
 
Bakar et al (2013) explored the important factors on to 
implement  Service  Oriented  Architecture/Service 
Oriented  Enterprise  Architecture  (SOEA)  in  the  firm 
and  recognized  the  maturity  models  used  to  measure 
the architecture effectiveness in the organization. 
 
Zdravković  et  al.  (2007)  designed  an  architectural 
model which concentrated more towards technological 
infrastructure  focused  on  migration  from  legacy  ERP 
functions  of 
to  SOA-based 
environment.  
 
Fazlollahtabar  et  al.  (2013)  developed  a  framework 
towards  serving  distributed  communication  based  on 
real  time  behaviors  of  service.  They  also  suggest  a 
service  oriented  framework  for  ERP  and  Decision 
Support System (DSS) of manufacturing organizations. 
they  presented  business  process

Zadeh  et  al.  (2013)  carried  out  an  analysis  of 
Enterprise Resource Planning versus Service Oriented 
Architecture  in  small  to  medium-sized  firms.  This 
study  showed  that  it  is  easy  to  understand  at  the  first 
glance  that  SOA  capabilities  will  prepare  better 
infrastructure  than  object  oriented  systems  such  as 
ERP.  
 
Alwadain  et  al.  (2011)  suggest  that  SOA  is  needed 
because  the  modern  enterprise  deals  with  complex 
systems  to  align  the  business  function  with  fast 
growing  technological  changes.  When  enterprise  uses 
SOA,  it  is  called  as  Service-Oriented  Enterprise 
Architecture  (SOEA).    It  transforms  the  enterprise  in 

techniques 

terms  of  business  process  engineering  and  agility  for 
the  organization’s  competitive  advantage.  In  order  to 
support  decision-making  and  ever-changing  business 
needs,  SOEA  is  essential  to  achieve  firm’s  business 
objectives.  BIG  DATA  systems  help  create  business 
value  through  ERP  transformation  by  means  of 
increased velocity and agility, improved reliability and 
support  as  well  as  enhanced  cost  efficiency.  SOEA 
strategies  also  support  to  maximize  the  transforming 
efforts  from  the  legacy  systems  to  new  ERP  systems. 
This transformation will take full advantage of return-
on-investment (ROI) and Total Cost Ownership (TCO) 
in terms of implementing cloud ERP (CERP) projects. 
 
As highlighted by Galinium and Shahbaz (2009, p.16), 
legacy  systems  are  applications  which  are  based  on 
mainframe  or  client-server  application  designs,  such 
as  Cloud  ERP,  supply  chain  management  (SCM)  or 
Supplier-Relationship Management (SRM) in order to 
run  the  business  process  to  make  appropriate  ROI. 
Bisbal  (1999)  suggest  that  organizations  has  to  keep

overall  aim  is  to  restructure  the  entire  firm  and  to

Because  of  day-to-day  change  in  technology,  the 
organization  is  expecting  management  change  in

strategy of SOA is required to minimize cost, increase 
network  security,  reduce  data  redundancy,  gain 
transparency  and  reusability  of  services  from  the 
legacy systems. 
 
Potential of Legacy Systems 
This is one of the important factors need to considered 
before  the  migration  stage  is  considered.  During  the 
integration  process, 
services  or 
components  may  not  be  reused  due  to  the  technical 
constraints  or  incompatibility  with  the  operating 
system  of  the  legacy  systems.    The  second  reason  is 
that 
components

SOA Governance 
SOA  governance  is  just  how  a  service  can  be  shared 
according  to  the  set  of  rules  and  policies  which  is 
applicable  to  all  of  the  stake  holders  and  in  turn 
improve  the  business  processes  in  an  organization.  It 
also  helps  improve  visibility  control  of  SOA  in  order 
to  minimize  risk  and  total  cost  ownership  (TCO).  It 
will further align with business goals as well as helps 
streamline the operations of an organization. In terms 
of  enterprises,  it  creates  reusable  network  with

Business Process of an Organization 
Business  Processes  in  an  organization  need  to  be 
aligned  across  organizational  divisions,  systems  and 
related  applications  to  streamline  business  operations 
in  order  to  increase  efficiency  of  an  organization. 
Organizations  need  to  correct  and  improve  business 
process  before  automating  them.  Furthermore,  firms 
need  to  standardize  the  business  processes  across  the 
enterprise  to  its  competitive  advantage.  This  will 
further  reduce  the  overall  IT  costs  and  redundancy

Recommendations 
The  following  are  the  recommendations  in  order  to 
incorporate SOA to solve the issues in legacy systems: 
Services  need  to  have  reusable  components;  Enable 
service  inputs  and  outputs  that  does  not  require 
construction  of  complex  consumers;  they  are  of  a 
request-response  nature;  improve  business  processes 
by  identifying  key  business  functions,  eliminating 
redundancy 
in 
business  processes  and  all  services  must  accessible 
with legacy systems.

II.  LITERATURE REVIEW 

Recent  surveys  have  shown  importance  of  SOA  with 
BIG DATA systems such as Cloud ERP (Neaga & Hai, 
2013; Zadeh et al., 2012; Nicolescu et al., 2007). SOA 
provides a new Business Process Reengineering (BPR) 
which  covers  organizational,  technical  and  project 
aspects  (Alwadain  et  al.,  2011).  Zhang  and  Yang 
(2004)  suggests  a  reengineering  approach  which  will 
restructure  the  legacy  systems  that  leads  to  Service-
Oriented  Architecture  (SOA)  by  considering  the 
business requirements of an organization.  
 
IBM  presented  some  of  their  experience  with  a 
number  of  organizations  which  adopting  SOA  and 
recommended  four  areas  of  adoption  challenges: 
program  management,  organization,  technology,  and 
governance  (Naghmeh  et  al.,  2014).  They  have 
identified  32  most  potential  and  challenging  factors 
for SOA adoption in organizations. 
 
To  succeed  at  Service-Oriented  Architecture  the  first 
step is to educate the organization and do not attempt 
to  introduce  SOA  globally  through  a  big-bang  effort. 
Start with a pilot project that showcases what SOA has 
to offer. Extend the success of your pilot SOA project 
by attempting a slightly bigger or more complex one.

The growth of Business Intelligence Systems (BIS) is 
faster and plays a vital role in almost all organizations 
across  the  world.  The  Service-Oriented  Architecture 
(SOA)  is  an  improved  approach  which  will  solve  the 
issues  in  legacy  or  old  systems  and  handles  huge 
volumes  of  data  such  as  BIG  DATA  systems.  SOA 
also  ensures  efficiency,  agility,  productivity  and 
integrity  of  an  enterprise  through  multiple  tasks  or 
subsystems 
the  business  processes  of  an 
organization.    The  main  purpose  of  this  study  is  to 
identify  the  important  factors  that  are  needed  to 
implement SOA in BIG DATA systems such as cloud 
ERP (CERP).  
 
Service-oriented  is  splitting  the  problems  into  entity 
and  related  smaller  parts  of  logic  or  service.  Service 
orientation  standard  proposes  the  organization  needs 
to explain businesses tasks, entity, or process into well 
grained  service  granularity  from  the  perspective  of 
IT/IS.  SOA  adoption  is  an  evolutionary  process  and 
there  are  many  reasons  for  SOA  gaining  particular 
interest  towards  the  research  context  (Naghmeh  et  al. 
2014).  SOA  has  been  widely  stimulated  by  computer 
analysts and vendors because of its architecture which 
is  adaptable 
firm’s  business 
expectations  in  a  low  cost  and  just-in-time  (JIT) 
manner.    SOA  lead  numerous  advantage  such  as

Governance  is  needed  to  control  the  service  lifecycle 
(as  a  start)  and  then  to  begin  to  hammer  out  policies 
and  procedures  that  must  be  followed  in  order  to 
develop, publish, and consume services (Adrian). 
  
Wang  (2013)  adopted  the  SOA  for  the  analysis  and 
design  of  business  processes  such  as  service 
identification,  specification  and  realization.  He  also 
used  top-down,  bottom-up  and  meet-in-the-middle  to 
identify the required service. The service specification 
helps to align business and technology to improve the 
efficiency of the firm.   
 
Yavari  et  al.  (2013)    proposed  a  method  named 
Service-Oriented  SysFailRate  Measurement 
for 
measuring  the  failure  rate  of  the  system  in  service-
oriented architecture using fuzzy logic. In this system, 
incomplete  description  of  a 
lack  of 
integration, incorrect format, and being out of the pre-
determined  time  out  factors  were  used  to  measuring 
the  failure  rate.  Testing  rests  demonstrated  that  this 
approach

Bakar et al (2013) explored the important factors on to 
implement  Service  Oriented  Architecture/Service 
Oriented  Enterprise  Architecture  (SOEA)  in  the  firm 
and  recognized  the  maturity  models  used  to  measure 
the architecture effectiveness in the organization. 
 
Zdravković  et  al.  (2007)  designed  an  architectural 
model which concentrated more towards technological 
infrastructure  focused  on  migration  from  legacy  ERP 
functions  of 
to  SOA-based 
environment.  
 
Fazlollahtabar  et  al.  (2013)  developed  a  framework 
towards  serving  distributed  communication  based  on 
real  time  behaviors  of  service.  They  also  suggest  a 
service  oriented  framework  for  ERP  and  Decision 
Support System (DSS) of manufacturing organizations. 
they  presented  business  process 
Furthermore,

Zadeh  et  al.  (2013)  carried  out  an  analysis  of 
Enterprise Resource Planning versus Service Oriented 
Architecture  in  small  to  medium-sized  firms.  This 
study  showed  that  it  is  easy  to  understand  at  the  first 
glance  that  SOA  capabilities  will  prepare  better 
infrastructure  than  object  oriented  systems  such  as 
ERP.  
 
Alwadain  et  al.  (2011)  suggest  that  SOA  is  needed 
because  the  modern  enterprise  deals  with  complex 
systems  to  align  the  business  function  with  fast 
growing  technological  changes.  When  enterprise  uses 
SOA,  it  is  called  as  Service-Oriented  Enterprise 
Architecture  (SOEA).    It  transforms  the  enterprise  in 

techniques 

terms  of  business  process  engineering  and  agility  for 
the  organization’s  competitive  advantage.  In  order  to 
support  decision-making  and  ever-changing  business 
needs,  SOEA  is  essential  to  achieve  firm’s  business 
objectives.  BIG  DATA  systems  help  create  business 
value  through  ERP  transformation  by  means  of 
increased velocity and agility, improved reliability and 
support  as  well  as  enhanced  cost  efficiency.  SOEA 
strategies  also  support  to  maximize  the  transforming 
efforts  from  the  legacy  systems  to  new  ERP  systems. 
This transformation will take full advantage of return-
on-investment (ROI) and Total Cost Ownership (TCO) 
in terms of implementing cloud ERP (CERP) projects. 
 
As highlighted by Galinium and Shahbaz (2009, p.16), 
legacy  systems  are  applications  which  are  based  on 
mainframe  or  client-server  application  designs,  such 
as  Cloud  ERP,  supply  chain  management  (SCM)  or 
Supplier-Relationship Management (SRM) in order to 
run  the  business  process  to  make  appropriate  ROI. 
Bisbal  (1999)  suggest  that  organizations  has  to  keep 
original  data  and  functionality  while  it  transforms  to 
new  system  from  the  legacy  system  because  the 
legacy  systems  is  very  important  as  it  has  the 
organization’s information flow.  
 
SOEA is essential, in particular for implementing BIG 
DATA  systems  such  as  Cloud  ERP  because  the  firm 
needs  to  collaborate  third  party  vendors  to  create 
customer  value,  maximize  the  profit  and  explore  new 
business 
other  multinational 
organizations globally (Shu and Chuang, 2010). Cloud 
ERP is essential as it create new services without any 
financial  constraints  such  as  server  cost  and  high 
maintain  capabilities  and  allows  firms  to  concentrate 
its core business functions. 
 
SOEA  is  a  part  of  technology  perspective  and  the 
overall  aim  is  to  restructure  the  entire  firm  and  to 
synchronize  the  firm’s  vision  and  needs  which  can 
drive technology towards the organizational goals.     
 
SOEA  is  greatly  changing  the  way  that  IT  vendors 
build and use BIG DATA applications  such as  Cloud 
ERP (CERP) because all the broken part in the legacy 
systems  are  considered  as  layers  that  consists  of 
services and components to be reused.  
 
Although there were many articles published so far in 
SOA,  there  is  still  a  lack  of  empirical  evidence  for 
factors  implementing  BIG  DATA  systems  such  as 
cloud  ERP  (CERP).  This  study  would  be  very  useful 
for academicians and practitioners who intend to write 
articles on SOA in near future. 
 
Issues in Legacy Systems 
The following are the issues related to legacy system: 
Very close linkage between systems  modules; Design 
time sharing of semantics; Pre-defined set of users and

usage patterns; System modules owned by same firms 
(Lewis  and  Smith,  2008).  Whereas  SOA  systems  are 
loosely  coupled  between  services  and  service 
consumers;  Semantics  shared  at  all  times  which 
smoothen  communication  between  service  developers 
and  service  consumers;  potentially  unidentified  set  of 
users  and  usage  patterns;  System  modules  owned  by 
many organizations.  
 
The following sections will highlight issues in process, 
requirements,  architecture  and  design 
legacy 
systems: Processes  must reflect the expected strategic 
approach  and  must  be  iterative  in  terms  of  software 
development  life  cycle;  Processes  must  satisfy  the 
needs of both internal and external services; and there 
must  be  a  need  of  technology  evaluation.  Require  a 
focus on how to manage a business process; must deal 
with  large  number  of  investors;  Responsibilities  of 
each  system  component  such  as  consumers,  services 
and 
to  be  clearly  defined; 
technology need to be evaluated at constant intervals; 
implications  of  external  services  and  consumers  need 
to  be  analysed  in  order  to  check  whether  it  meets 
expected  quality  of  service;  final  decision  lead  to 
promote reusable components.  
 
The main goal of SOA adoption is improving business 
processes  in  an  integrated  environment  within  and 
outside  the  organization.  The  main  barrier  is  finding 
people with right skills and lack of SOA governance.

Because  of  day-to-day  change  in  technology,  the 
organization  is  expecting  management  change  in 
terms  of  business  process  analysis  to  come  up  with 
data  definitions  and  standard  schemas.  Furthermore, 
the design and architectural model  need to be built-in 
so  that  the  technical  gap  is  narrowed  to  help  vendors 
to  minimize  the  implementation  issues,  in  particular 
BIG  DATA  systems  such  as  ERP.  The  migration 
strategy of SOA is required to minimize cost, increase 
network  security,  reduce  data  redundancy,  gain 
transparency  and  reusability  of  services  from  the 
legacy systems. 
 
Potential of Legacy Systems 
This is one of the important factors need to considered 
before  the  migration  stage  is  considered.  During  the 
integration  process, 
services  or 
components  may  not  be  reused  due  to  the  technical 
constraints  or  incompatibility  with  the  operating 
system  of  the  legacy  systems.    The  second  reason  is 
that 
components 
transformation cost may go higher. 
 
SOA Governance 
SOA  governance  is  just  how  a  service  can  be  shared 
according  to  the  set  of  rules  and  policies  which  is 
applicable  to  all  of  the  stake  holders  and  in  turn 
improve  the  business  processes  in  an  organization.  It 
also  helps  improve  visibility  control  of  SOA  in  order 
to  minimize  risk  and  total  cost  ownership  (TCO).  It 
will further align with business goals as well as helps 
streamline the operations of an organization. In terms 
of  enterprises,  it  creates  reusable  network  with 
interoperable services  which is really very helpful for 
vendors in implementing BIG DATA systems such as 
cloud ERP. 
 
Business Process of an Organization 
Business  Processes  in  an  organization  need  to  be 
aligned  across  organizational  divisions,  systems  and 
related  applications  to  streamline  business  operations 
in  order  to  increase  efficiency  of  an  organization. 
Organizations  need  to  correct  and  improve  business 
process  before  automating  them.  Furthermore,  firms 
need  to  standardize  the  business  processes  across  the 
enterprise  to  its  competitive  advantage.  This  will 
further  reduce  the  overall  IT  costs  and  redundancy

Recommendations 
The  following  are  the  recommendations  in  order  to 
incorporate SOA to solve the issues in legacy systems: 
Services  need  to  have  reusable  components;  Enable 
service  inputs  and  outputs  that  does  not  require 
construction  of  complex  consumers;  they  are  of  a 
request-response  nature;  improve  business  processes 
by  identifying  key  business  functions,  eliminating 
redundancy 
in 
business  processes  and  all  services  must  accessible 
with legacy systems.

V.  DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION 

A  survey  of  questionnaire  has  been  sent  to  320 
organizations  and  data  received  (response  rate  of 
71.3%)  has  been  collected  through  online  blog  from 
India, particularly cities in Chennai, Mumbai and New 
Delhi.  The  data  has  been  analysed  using  partial  least 
square  (smartPLS)  statistical  package  and  results  are 
discussed as well as concluded.     
 
RESULTS, ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS 

This  research  work  carries  out  two  assessments: 
internal  consistency  reliability  and  convergent  and 
discriminant  validity.  The  reliability  of  all  variables 
with  values  above  0.7  which  is  adequate  for  the  five 
factors such as SOAM, POLS, SOAG, BPO, and BPS 
(Nunnally, 1978).

The  results  of  the  cross  loading  are  shown  in 
Table 3. As suggested by Hair et al. (2009), all 
the  individual  item  constructs  are  higher  than 
0.5  indicating  significant  convergent  validity.  
Furthermore,  it  is  clearly  seen  that  the  five-
factor solution is suitable and the items display 
required discriminant validity.

  The

evidence. 

This study has been conducted to share ideas about the 
factors  of  SOA  to  implement  BIG  DATA  systems. 
The factors such as SOA Migration Strategy, Potential 
of  Legacy  Systems,  SOA  Governance,  Business 
Process Organization, and Business Plan Organization 
are  very  essential  and  played  a  vital  role  in  BIG 
DATA  systems  which  has  been  revealed  through 
empirical 
process 
reengineering (BPR) can be achieved through aligning 
software  reengineering  procedures  with  business 
process  management  techniques.  The  challenge  here 
with  respect  to  BPR  is  the  transformation  of  legacy 
code  for  services  that  have  commercial  value.    SOA 
really serves both the purposes of organizational needs 
such as cross-functional communication; performance 
and  integration  with  the  legacy  system;  and  technical 
needs 
functional  and  non-functional 
requirements of the system; enable distribution of sub 
systems to be partitioned among multi processors and 
increasing  the  reusability  of  existing  components  or 
modules  with  the  legacy  or  third  party  application 
software  (Malan,  1996).  Furthermore,  SOA  deliver 
potential  benefits

improvement on flexibility, cost reduction in terms of 
migration  from  the  legacy  systems,  risk  mitigation, 
increase  return  on  investment  (ROI)  particularly  in 
supply  chain  management  such  as  cloud  ERP  and 
provide  a  direction  to  new  products  and  services 
(DiMare,  2006).  With  an  SOA,  you  can  create  a 
service then reuse that business functionality for other 
circumstances  or 
third  party  software 
applications.  This  reduce  the  amount  of  coding 
required 
processes. 
Furthermore,  SOA  permits  businesses  to  rapidly 
respond  to  trends  in  the  current  market  in  a  cost-
efficient  manner  and 
the  Return  on 
Investment  (ROI),  in  particular,  BIG  DATA  systems 
such  as  cloud  ERP.  Cloud  ERP  is  very  helpful  in 
terms of the data storage and how it is delivered.
