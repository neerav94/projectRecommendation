Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have

in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more

(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.

owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

5Cash is ﬁrst exchanged for a play-card linked to a unique loyalty-card ID or for chips on the casino ﬂoor. Most
aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

it

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

of which property to visit, y(1)

ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

it

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of

the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)
ijt .

3. Conditional on visiting, how much will i spend. Denote this by the continuous variable y(2)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of

“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

7

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

k=1

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,



(cid:16)

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

ij , ς (2)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)
ijt .

3. Conditional on visiting, how much will i spend. Denote this by the continuous variable y(2)

it

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

k=1

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,



it = µ

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

ij , ς (2)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation

tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more

(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

k=1

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

ij , ς (2)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.

above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)
ijt .

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

k=1

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,



it = µ

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)
ijt .

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)
ijt .

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

16

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

3

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of

the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

16

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

k=1

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

16

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

it

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

k=1

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

ij , ς (2)

ij , σj}J

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

7

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)
ijt .

(cid:17)

3. Conditional on visiting, how much will i spend. Denote this by the continuous variable y(2)
it .

it

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

7

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,



In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

3

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)

j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

16

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

ability to scale rapidly to scoring large numbers of consumers. For instance, a speciﬁc campaign we
consider in the next section involves scoring about 2M consumers on close for 50+ promotional options.
The optimization package should also integrate well with the statistical models presented above, and
provide managers to ability to add constraints to the optimization in a user-friendly manner. We
implemented these on Teradata c(cid:13), a commercial database platform that is developed for Big Data
analytics applications.

On the optimization front, the main gain is the ability to customize promotions to each individual
consumer. Prior to our engagement, promotions were assigned at the segment-level. The new system
enabled optimizing promotions to the individual consumer-level, facilitating ﬁner micro-targeting.
Further, compared to the prior system, the number of bundles that could be considered increased
by about 6X, increasing the number of instruments available to improve promotion eﬃciency. With
additional hardware space and time, it is straightforward to scale up the system to accommodate even
larger bundle sets.

Finally, dashboard applications were also developed that enabled managers to monitor and dissect
company performance on their desktops. Figure (11) provides an example. These dashboards were
linked to the underlying statistical model and optimization packages, so as to embed the framework
in a user-friendly decision support system.

This completes the discussion of the model framework and development eﬀort.

8 Results from a Randomized Evaluation

The models developed above are assessed as part of a large-scale randomized test at MGM. We imple-
ment the test as part of the Summer 2012 corporate campaign. The test evaluates the performance
of the model in selecting consumers to whom a set of promotion bundles could be targeted, as well as
the ability of the model to match consumers to one of these promotion bundles.

The test involves about 2M customers, picked from MGM’s prospect database. The goal of the test
is to compare the eﬃcacy of the model in promotional targeting relative to the status quo approach
used at the ﬁrm. The test is implemented as follows. First, a pilot test was conducted in Spring 2012
with a limited number of promotional oﬀerings to assess test design, understand ball-park customer
response and to understand logistics of implementation. Based on this, the 2M consumers in the
prospect data are randomly divided into 3 groups prior to the beginning of summer. Group 1 con-
sumers (30% of the total) are scored on the model we develop. Group 2 (30% of the total) consumers
are scored based on the status-quo approach (Theo on last visit and demographics). Group 3 con-
sumers (10% of the total) are treated as the control – they do not receive any of the corporate oﬀers.
The remaining 30% of consumers are tested on auxiliary aspects that are unrelated to the model, and
are not relevant to this evaluation. Managers then created 75+ promotion bundles which comprise
the set of possible promotions that could be oﬀered to consumers in the campaign. Each consumer
could be oﬀered only one bundle during the campaign. Once scoring is completed for groups 1 and 2,
assignment of these promotion bundles is implemented in the following way. In group 1, each customer
is assigned the promotion bundle that provides the highest proﬁtability subject to making a minimum
threshold margin. The margin is set outside the model by management. If the expected proﬁtability
of the best oﬀer does not meet the margin threshold, no corporate promotion is sent to that consumer.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)
ijt .

(cid:17)

3. Conditional on visiting, how much will i spend. Denote this by the continuous variable y(2)
it .

it

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)

heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

ability to scale rapidly to scoring large numbers of consumers. For instance, a speciﬁc campaign we
consider in the next section involves scoring about 2M consumers on close for 50+ promotional options.
The optimization package should also integrate well with the statistical models presented above, and
provide managers to ability to add constraints to the optimization in a user-friendly manner. We
implemented these on Teradata c(cid:13), a commercial database platform that is developed for Big Data
analytics applications.

On the optimization front, the main gain is the ability to customize promotions to each individual
consumer. Prior to our engagement, promotions were assigned at the segment-level. The new system
enabled optimizing promotions to the individual consumer-level, facilitating ﬁner micro-targeting.
Further, compared to the prior system, the number of bundles that could be considered increased
by about 6X, increasing the number of instruments available to improve promotion eﬃciency. With
additional hardware space and time, it is straightforward to scale up the system to accommodate even
larger bundle sets.

Finally, dashboard applications were also developed that enabled managers to monitor and dissect
company performance on their desktops. Figure (11) provides an example. These dashboards were
linked to the underlying statistical model and optimization packages, so as to embed the framework
in a user-friendly decision support system.

This completes the discussion of the model framework and development eﬀort.

8 Results from a Randomized Evaluation

The models developed above are assessed as part of a large-scale randomized test at MGM. We imple-
ment the test as part of the Summer 2012 corporate campaign. The test evaluates the performance
of the model in selecting consumers to whom a set of promotion bundles could be targeted, as well as
the ability of the model to match consumers to one of these promotion bundles.

The test involves about 2M customers, picked from MGM’s prospect database. The goal of the test
is to compare the eﬃcacy of the model in promotional targeting relative to the status quo approach
used at the ﬁrm. The test is implemented as follows. First, a pilot test was conducted in Spring 2012
with a limited number of promotional oﬀerings to assess test design, understand ball-park customer
response and to understand logistics of implementation. Based on this, the 2M consumers in the
prospect data are randomly divided into 3 groups prior to the beginning of summer. Group 1 con-
sumers (30% of the total) are scored on the model we develop. Group 2 (30% of the total) consumers
are scored based on the status-quo approach (Theo on last visit and demographics). Group 3 con-
sumers (10% of the total) are treated as the control – they do not receive any of the corporate oﬀers.
The remaining 30% of consumers are tested on auxiliary aspects that are unrelated to the model, and
are not relevant to this evaluation. Managers then created 75+ promotion bundles which comprise
the set of possible promotions that could be oﬀered to consumers in the campaign. Each consumer
could be oﬀered only one bundle during the campaign. Once scoring is completed for groups 1 and 2,
assignment of these promotion bundles is implemented in the following way. In group 1, each customer
is assigned the promotion bundle that provides the highest proﬁtability subject to making a minimum
threshold margin. The margin is set outside the model by management. If the expected proﬁtability
of the best oﬀer does not meet the margin threshold, no corporate promotion is sent to that consumer.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

3

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

ability to scale rapidly to scoring large numbers of consumers. For instance, a speciﬁc campaign we
consider in the next section involves scoring about 2M consumers on close for 50+ promotional options.
The optimization package should also integrate well with the statistical models presented above, and
provide managers to ability to add constraints to the optimization in a user-friendly manner. We
implemented these on Teradata c(cid:13), a commercial database platform that is developed for Big Data
analytics applications.

On the optimization front, the main gain is the ability to customize promotions to each individual
consumer. Prior to our engagement, promotions were assigned at the segment-level. The new system
enabled optimizing promotions to the individual consumer-level, facilitating ﬁner micro-targeting.
Further, compared to the prior system, the number of bundles that could be considered increased
by about 6X, increasing the number of instruments available to improve promotion eﬃciency. With
additional hardware space and time, it is straightforward to scale up the system to accommodate even
larger bundle sets.

Finally, dashboard applications were also developed that enabled managers to monitor and dissect
company performance on their desktops. Figure (11) provides an example. These dashboards were
linked to the underlying statistical model and optimization packages, so as to embed the framework
in a user-friendly decision support system.

This completes the discussion of the model framework and development eﬀort.

8 Results from a Randomized Evaluation

The models developed above are assessed as part of a large-scale randomized test at MGM. We imple-
ment the test as part of the Summer 2012 corporate campaign. The test evaluates the performance
of the model in selecting consumers to whom a set of promotion bundles could be targeted, as well as
the ability of the model to match consumers to one of these promotion bundles.

The test involves about 2M customers, picked from MGM’s prospect database. The goal of the test
is to compare the eﬃcacy of the model in promotional targeting relative to the status quo approach
used at the ﬁrm. The test is implemented as follows. First, a pilot test was conducted in Spring 2012
with a limited number of promotional oﬀerings to assess test design, understand ball-park customer
response and to understand logistics of implementation. Based on this, the 2M consumers in the
prospect data are randomly divided into 3 groups prior to the beginning of summer. Group 1 con-
sumers (30% of the total) are scored on the model we develop. Group 2 (30% of the total) consumers
are scored based on the status-quo approach (Theo on last visit and demographics). Group 3 con-
sumers (10% of the total) are treated as the control – they do not receive any of the corporate oﬀers.
The remaining 30% of consumers are tested on auxiliary aspects that are unrelated to the model, and
are not relevant to this evaluation. Managers then created 75+ promotion bundles which comprise
the set of possible promotions that could be oﬀered to consumers in the campaign. Each consumer
could be oﬀered only one bundle during the campaign. Once scoring is completed for groups 1 and 2,
assignment of these promotion bundles is implemented in the following way. In group 1, each customer
is assigned the promotion bundle that provides the highest proﬁtability subject to making a minimum
threshold margin. The margin is set outside the model by management. If the expected proﬁtability
of the best oﬀer does not meet the margin threshold, no corporate promotion is sent to that consumer.

In group 2, consumers are sorted into segments as per the status quo method. Managers then assign
a segment-speciﬁc promotion bundle to each segment in the group in the same way as they have made
those decisions in the past. All corporate oﬀers are then emailed to consumers. The oﬀers are valid
for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012. All visits to any of the MGM properties along with
all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers are then tracked during the July 31 − Oct 31
window during which the promotion is active. No other corporate marketing was targeted at these
consumers at that time.

During the same period, the three groups are also exposed to non-corporate campaigns set in-
dependently by the MGM resorts’ individual property marketing teams. Thus, those in the control
and treatment groups receive other property-speciﬁc promotion oﬀers over and above those associated
with the corporate test. Hence, the performance of groups 1 and 2 relative to the control should
be interpreted as the net eﬀect of the corporate campaign relative to the existing property-speciﬁc
marketing activity. The promotions for the individual properties are mailed out in the Summer prior
to July, and are set independent of the corporate campaign; so they are not jointly allocated or adjust
in respond to the corporate level interventions in the test and control groups.10 These aspects of
the test-design derives from organizational considerations within the ﬁrm − organizationally, it was
not feasible to stop all property-speciﬁc promotional activity during the test period. Therefore, we
believe the test provides a lower bound on the performance of the new methods within the ﬁrm as a
whole, because further gains to what is assessed in the test can be had if property-speciﬁc campaigns
are also coordinated with the corporate campaign. Further, to the extent the new method is better,
implementing it at the individual properties as well would be the source of additional gains from the
adoption of the new analytics solution. Figure (12) presents the test design pictorially.

Table (2) reports the results. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, all dollar numbers in Table (2)
have been scaled by an undisclosed constant; so these should be interpreted as scaled dollars. When
we refer to revenues or costs below, we refer to these in scaled dollars, which we call units of “R$”
for brevity. Column 1 of Table (2) report on the results for Group 1, column 2 for Group 2 and the
last for the control. The top row of the table reports “adjusted” revenues for each group. These are
constructed by summing all gaming and non-gaming Theo from agents in a group that visited during
the July 31 − Oct 31 window, and subtracting out any Freeplay dollars used as well as the dollar
value of any MGM-speciﬁc reward points redeemed during that period. The company does not count
freeplay and reward point redemption as sources of real revenue, and considers this as the right metric
for assessing policy. Note this makes the adjusted revenues a more conservative metric of the gains
from a campaign. The next row reports the costs of the campaign across the three groups. These are
calculated as the net dollar value of promotions oﬀered. Other costs of running the campaign (e.g.,
printing direct mail) are not included. The costs row for groups 1 and 2 refer to the costs incurred
by the corporate team to run the campaign. The cost entry for the control group refer to the costs
incurred by the properties to run the other campaigns they conducted in parallel to the focal corporate
promotion.

Looking at Table (2), we see that net adjusted revenues from those who received the corporate

10Individual-properties also employ on-the-ﬂoor promotions like free-drinks allocated to playing patrons, that may
adjust to the consumer play behavior induced by our interventions. While we do not rule this kind of promotion
adjustment at the individual-property level, we believe the impact of these on our results is very small, as these kinds of
activities account for less than 5% of promotional spending by the properties. The bulk of property speciﬁc promotions
are mailed out and are pre-determined during the intervention period.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

7

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)

promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,



it = µ

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

ij , ς (2)

ij , σj}J

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

ability to scale rapidly to scoring large numbers of consumers. For instance, a speciﬁc campaign we
consider in the next section involves scoring about 2M consumers on close for 50+ promotional options.
The optimization package should also integrate well with the statistical models presented above, and
provide managers to ability to add constraints to the optimization in a user-friendly manner. We
implemented these on Teradata c(cid:13), a commercial database platform that is developed for Big Data
analytics applications.

On the optimization front, the main gain is the ability to customize promotions to each individual
consumer. Prior to our engagement, promotions were assigned at the segment-level. The new system
enabled optimizing promotions to the individual consumer-level, facilitating ﬁner micro-targeting.
Further, compared to the prior system, the number of bundles that could be considered increased
by about 6X, increasing the number of instruments available to improve promotion eﬃciency. With
additional hardware space and time, it is straightforward to scale up the system to accommodate even
larger bundle sets.

Finally, dashboard applications were also developed that enabled managers to monitor and dissect
company performance on their desktops. Figure (11) provides an example. These dashboards were
linked to the underlying statistical model and optimization packages, so as to embed the framework
in a user-friendly decision support system.

This completes the discussion of the model framework and development eﬀort.

8 Results from a Randomized Evaluation

The models developed above are assessed as part of a large-scale randomized test at MGM. We imple-
ment the test as part of the Summer 2012 corporate campaign. The test evaluates the performance
of the model in selecting consumers to whom a set of promotion bundles could be targeted, as well as
the ability of the model to match consumers to one of these promotion bundles.

The test involves about 2M customers, picked from MGM’s prospect database. The goal of the test
is to compare the eﬃcacy of the model in promotional targeting relative to the status quo approach
used at the ﬁrm. The test is implemented as follows. First, a pilot test was conducted in Spring 2012
with a limited number of promotional oﬀerings to assess test design, understand ball-park customer
response and to understand logistics of implementation. Based on this, the 2M consumers in the
prospect data are randomly divided into 3 groups prior to the beginning of summer. Group 1 con-
sumers (30% of the total) are scored on the model we develop. Group 2 (30% of the total) consumers
are scored based on the status-quo approach (Theo on last visit and demographics). Group 3 con-
sumers (10% of the total) are treated as the control – they do not receive any of the corporate oﬀers.
The remaining 30% of consumers are tested on auxiliary aspects that are unrelated to the model, and
are not relevant to this evaluation. Managers then created 75+ promotion bundles which comprise
the set of possible promotions that could be oﬀered to consumers in the campaign. Each consumer
could be oﬀered only one bundle during the campaign. Once scoring is completed for groups 1 and 2,
assignment of these promotion bundles is implemented in the following way. In group 1, each customer
is assigned the promotion bundle that provides the highest proﬁtability subject to making a minimum
threshold margin. The margin is set outside the model by management. If the expected proﬁtability
of the best oﬀer does not meet the margin threshold, no corporate promotion is sent to that consumer.

In group 2, consumers are sorted into segments as per the status quo method. Managers then assign
a segment-speciﬁc promotion bundle to each segment in the group in the same way as they have made
those decisions in the past. All corporate oﬀers are then emailed to consumers. The oﬀers are valid
for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012. All visits to any of the MGM properties along with
all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers are then tracked during the July 31 − Oct 31
window during which the promotion is active. No other corporate marketing was targeted at these
consumers at that time.

During the same period, the three groups are also exposed to non-corporate campaigns set in-
dependently by the MGM resorts’ individual property marketing teams. Thus, those in the control
and treatment groups receive other property-speciﬁc promotion oﬀers over and above those associated
with the corporate test. Hence, the performance of groups 1 and 2 relative to the control should
be interpreted as the net eﬀect of the corporate campaign relative to the existing property-speciﬁc
marketing activity. The promotions for the individual properties are mailed out in the Summer prior
to July, and are set independent of the corporate campaign; so they are not jointly allocated or adjust
in respond to the corporate level interventions in the test and control groups.10 These aspects of
the test-design derives from organizational considerations within the ﬁrm − organizationally, it was
not feasible to stop all property-speciﬁc promotional activity during the test period. Therefore, we
believe the test provides a lower bound on the performance of the new methods within the ﬁrm as a
whole, because further gains to what is assessed in the test can be had if property-speciﬁc campaigns
are also coordinated with the corporate campaign. Further, to the extent the new method is better,
implementing it at the individual properties as well would be the source of additional gains from the
adoption of the new analytics solution. Figure (12) presents the test design pictorially.

Table (2) reports the results. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, all dollar numbers in Table (2)
have been scaled by an undisclosed constant; so these should be interpreted as scaled dollars. When
we refer to revenues or costs below, we refer to these in scaled dollars, which we call units of “R$”
for brevity. Column 1 of Table (2) report on the results for Group 1, column 2 for Group 2 and the
last for the control. The top row of the table reports “adjusted” revenues for each group. These are
constructed by summing all gaming and non-gaming Theo from agents in a group that visited during
the July 31 − Oct 31 window, and subtracting out any Freeplay dollars used as well as the dollar
value of any MGM-speciﬁc reward points redeemed during that period. The company does not count
freeplay and reward point redemption as sources of real revenue, and considers this as the right metric
for assessing policy. Note this makes the adjusted revenues a more conservative metric of the gains
from a campaign. The next row reports the costs of the campaign across the three groups. These are
calculated as the net dollar value of promotions oﬀered. Other costs of running the campaign (e.g.,
printing direct mail) are not included. The costs row for groups 1 and 2 refer to the costs incurred
by the corporate team to run the campaign. The cost entry for the control group refer to the costs
incurred by the properties to run the other campaigns they conducted in parallel to the focal corporate
promotion.

Looking at Table (2), we see that net adjusted revenues from those who received the corporate

10Individual-properties also employ on-the-ﬂoor promotions like free-drinks allocated to playing patrons, that may
adjust to the consumer play behavior induced by our interventions. While we do not rule this kind of promotion
adjustment at the individual-property level, we believe the impact of these on our results is very small, as these kinds of
activities account for less than 5% of promotional spending by the properties. The bulk of property speciﬁc promotions
are mailed out and are pre-determined during the intervention period.

properties align with all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers in the test are then tracked during the July 31 −

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more

and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

k=1

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

16

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

ability to scale rapidly to scoring large numbers of consumers. For instance, a speciﬁc campaign we
consider in the next section involves scoring about 2M consumers on close for 50+ promotional options.
The optimization package should also integrate well with the statistical models presented above, and
provide managers to ability to add constraints to the optimization in a user-friendly manner. We
implemented these on Teradata c(cid:13), a commercial database platform that is developed for Big Data
analytics applications.

On the optimization front, the main gain is the ability to customize promotions to each individual
consumer. Prior to our engagement, promotions were assigned at the segment-level. The new system
enabled optimizing promotions to the individual consumer-level, facilitating ﬁner micro-targeting.
Further, compared to the prior system, the number of bundles that could be considered increased
by about 6X, increasing the number of instruments available to improve promotion eﬃciency. With
additional hardware space and time, it is straightforward to scale up the system to accommodate even
larger bundle sets.

Finally, dashboard applications were also developed that enabled managers to monitor and dissect
company performance on their desktops. Figure (11) provides an example. These dashboards were
linked to the underlying statistical model and optimization packages, so as to embed the framework
in a user-friendly decision support system.

This completes the discussion of the model framework and development eﬀort.

8 Results from a Randomized Evaluation

The models developed above are assessed as part of a large-scale randomized test at MGM. We imple-
ment the test as part of the Summer 2012 corporate campaign. The test evaluates the performance
of the model in selecting consumers to whom a set of promotion bundles could be targeted, as well as
the ability of the model to match consumers to one of these promotion bundles.

The test involves about 2M customers, picked from MGM’s prospect database. The goal of the test
is to compare the eﬃcacy of the model in promotional targeting relative to the status quo approach
used at the ﬁrm. The test is implemented as follows. First, a pilot test was conducted in Spring 2012
with a limited number of promotional oﬀerings to assess test design, understand ball-park customer
response and to understand logistics of implementation. Based on this, the 2M consumers in the
prospect data are randomly divided into 3 groups prior to the beginning of summer. Group 1 con-
sumers (30% of the total) are scored on the model we develop. Group 2 (30% of the total) consumers
are scored based on the status-quo approach (Theo on last visit and demographics). Group 3 con-
sumers (10% of the total) are treated as the control – they do not receive any of the corporate oﬀers.
The remaining 30% of consumers are tested on auxiliary aspects that are unrelated to the model, and
are not relevant to this evaluation. Managers then created 75+ promotion bundles which comprise
the set of possible promotions that could be oﬀered to consumers in the campaign. Each consumer
could be oﬀered only one bundle during the campaign. Once scoring is completed for groups 1 and 2,
assignment of these promotion bundles is implemented in the following way. In group 1, each customer
is assigned the promotion bundle that provides the highest proﬁtability subject to making a minimum
threshold margin. The margin is set outside the model by management. If the expected proﬁtability
of the best oﬀer does not meet the margin threshold, no corporate promotion is sent to that consumer.

In group 2, consumers are sorted into segments as per the status quo method. Managers then assign
a segment-speciﬁc promotion bundle to each segment in the group in the same way as they have made
those decisions in the past. All corporate oﬀers are then emailed to consumers. The oﬀers are valid
for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012. All visits to any of the MGM properties along with
all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers are then tracked during the July 31 − Oct 31
window during which the promotion is active. No other corporate marketing was targeted at these
consumers at that time.

During the same period, the three groups are also exposed to non-corporate campaigns set in-
dependently by the MGM resorts’ individual property marketing teams. Thus, those in the control
and treatment groups receive other property-speciﬁc promotion oﬀers over and above those associated
with the corporate test. Hence, the performance of groups 1 and 2 relative to the control should
be interpreted as the net eﬀect of the corporate campaign relative to the existing property-speciﬁc
marketing activity. The promotions for the individual properties are mailed out in the Summer prior
to July, and are set independent of the corporate campaign; so they are not jointly allocated or adjust
in respond to the corporate level interventions in the test and control groups.10 These aspects of
the test-design derives from organizational considerations within the ﬁrm − organizationally, it was
not feasible to stop all property-speciﬁc promotional activity during the test period. Therefore, we
believe the test provides a lower bound on the performance of the new methods within the ﬁrm as a
whole, because further gains to what is assessed in the test can be had if property-speciﬁc campaigns
are also coordinated with the corporate campaign. Further, to the extent the new method is better,
implementing it at the individual properties as well would be the source of additional gains from the
adoption of the new analytics solution. Figure (12) presents the test design pictorially.

Table (2) reports the results. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, all dollar numbers in Table (2)
have been scaled by an undisclosed constant; so these should be interpreted as scaled dollars. When
we refer to revenues or costs below, we refer to these in scaled dollars, which we call units of “R$”
for brevity. Column 1 of Table (2) report on the results for Group 1, column 2 for Group 2 and the
last for the control. The top row of the table reports “adjusted” revenues for each group. These are
constructed by summing all gaming and non-gaming Theo from agents in a group that visited during
the July 31 − Oct 31 window, and subtracting out any Freeplay dollars used as well as the dollar
value of any MGM-speciﬁc reward points redeemed during that period. The company does not count
freeplay and reward point redemption as sources of real revenue, and considers this as the right metric
for assessing policy. Note this makes the adjusted revenues a more conservative metric of the gains
from a campaign. The next row reports the costs of the campaign across the three groups. These are
calculated as the net dollar value of promotions oﬀered. Other costs of running the campaign (e.g.,
printing direct mail) are not included. The costs row for groups 1 and 2 refer to the costs incurred
by the corporate team to run the campaign. The cost entry for the control group refer to the costs
incurred by the properties to run the other campaigns they conducted in parallel to the focal corporate
promotion.

Looking at Table (2), we see that net adjusted revenues from those who received the corporate

10Individual-properties also employ on-the-ﬂoor promotions like free-drinks allocated to playing patrons, that may
adjust to the consumer play behavior induced by our interventions. While we do not rule this kind of promotion
adjustment at the individual-property level, we believe the impact of these on our results is very small, as these kinds of
activities account for less than 5% of promotional spending by the properties. The bulk of property speciﬁc promotions
are mailed out and are pre-determined during the intervention period.

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the design of the test conducted to evaluate the proposed model. Group A consumers were oﬀered

corporate promotions based on the model; Group B based on the status quo method; Group C (Control) consumers were

oﬀered no corporate promotions. All groups continued to receive promotions oﬀered by individual properties. The oﬀers are
valid for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012 and are mailed out in Summer 2012. All visits to any of the MGM
properties align with all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers in the test are then tracked during the July 31 −

Oct 31 window during which the promotion is active.

under the new model. Thus, adjusted revenues are higher under the new policy. We see net costs to
the corporate group are about R$41.42M under the new policy versus R$43.90M under the status-quo.
The upshot of the revenue and cost implications is about R$72.64M proﬁt to the casino under the new
policy compared to about R$68.07M under the status-quo. The diﬀerence is about R$4.57M for this
campaign. Even though we cannot disclose how much this is in real dollars, we are able to disclose a
range − in real dollars, this incremental diﬀerence is between $1 and $5M incremental proﬁt for the
ﬁrm.

The comparison to the control group is also informative about the relative proﬁtability of the new
method compared to the campaign strategies of the individual properties. Looking at the third column
in Table (2), we see that the various other campaigns run concurrently by the individual properties
brought in about R$36.8M of revenue from consumers in the control group. Recall that the control
is 1/3
rd the size of groups 1 and 2; so to obtain a relative comparison, we should multiply the dollars
in the control by 3. Computing scaled revenues 3×R$36.8M = R$110.4M, we see the new method
is superior in terms of revenues to the aggregated impact of the individual property campaigns as
well, bringing in about R$3.7M more (R$114.1M for the new policy vs. R$110.4M for the control).
Computing costs, the individual properties spent a scaled total of 3×R$14.5M = R$43.5M. The net
proﬁt impact is 3×R$22.2M = R$66.6M, which is less than the R$72.6M proﬁt associated with the
new policy. Note these comparisons are at the aggregate level, comparing the new method to the sum
total of the eﬀect across all 12 properties, and not a comparison of any one property’s method.

Computing a Return on Investment per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI
of about 2.75 compared to 2.53 for the individual properties, and 2.55 for the status-quo approach.
Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more incremental spending under the new
policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. As another metric, if the 4 campaigns in one year
each spent the same amount on promotions as the Summer campaign, at these levels of ROI, the ﬁrm
would make about R$33.6M (or between $10M and $15M in real dollars) in incremental proﬁt from
using the new model compared to the status-quo method, or about R$41.7M (or between $14M and
$19M in real dollars) in incremental revenues compared to the aggregation of the campaign planning
strategies of the individual properties.

9 Conclusions

Eﬀorts on developing and implementing a comprehensive marketing analytics solution for a real-world
company is presented. The framework leverages the richness of the company’s data to develop detailed
models of consumer behavior for use for optimized targeting. The models feature themes emphasized
in the academic marketing science literature, including incorporation of consumer heterogeneity and
state-dependence into utility, and the development of new methods for controlling for the endogene-
ity of the ﬁrm’s historical targeting rule in estimation. The issues discussed are relevant for other
customer-facing ﬁrms operating in data-rich environments that wish to improve their promotion tar-
geting and management using modern quantitative methods. The models are then assessed relative
to the status-quo using a large-scale ﬁeld intervention that shows the proﬁts from adopting the new
system are substantial. We believe the scale of model development and implementation and the com-
bination of the econometrics with a ﬁeld intervention in the context of a real-world ﬁrm are novel to

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

3

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

ability to scale rapidly to scoring large numbers of consumers. For instance, a speciﬁc campaign we
consider in the next section involves scoring about 2M consumers on close for 50+ promotional options.
The optimization package should also integrate well with the statistical models presented above, and
provide managers to ability to add constraints to the optimization in a user-friendly manner. We
implemented these on Teradata c(cid:13), a commercial database platform that is developed for Big Data
analytics applications.

On the optimization front, the main gain is the ability to customize promotions to each individual
consumer. Prior to our engagement, promotions were assigned at the segment-level. The new system
enabled optimizing promotions to the individual consumer-level, facilitating ﬁner micro-targeting.
Further, compared to the prior system, the number of bundles that could be considered increased
by about 6X, increasing the number of instruments available to improve promotion eﬃciency. With
additional hardware space and time, it is straightforward to scale up the system to accommodate even
larger bundle sets.

Finally, dashboard applications were also developed that enabled managers to monitor and dissect
company performance on their desktops. Figure (11) provides an example. These dashboards were
linked to the underlying statistical model and optimization packages, so as to embed the framework
in a user-friendly decision support system.

This completes the discussion of the model framework and development eﬀort.

8 Results from a Randomized Evaluation

The models developed above are assessed as part of a large-scale randomized test at MGM. We imple-
ment the test as part of the Summer 2012 corporate campaign. The test evaluates the performance
of the model in selecting consumers to whom a set of promotion bundles could be targeted, as well as
the ability of the model to match consumers to one of these promotion bundles.

The test involves about 2M customers, picked from MGM’s prospect database. The goal of the test
is to compare the eﬃcacy of the model in promotional targeting relative to the status quo approach
used at the ﬁrm. The test is implemented as follows. First, a pilot test was conducted in Spring 2012
with a limited number of promotional oﬀerings to assess test design, understand ball-park customer
response and to understand logistics of implementation. Based on this, the 2M consumers in the
prospect data are randomly divided into 3 groups prior to the beginning of summer. Group 1 con-
sumers (30% of the total) are scored on the model we develop. Group 2 (30% of the total) consumers
are scored based on the status-quo approach (Theo on last visit and demographics). Group 3 con-
sumers (10% of the total) are treated as the control – they do not receive any of the corporate oﬀers.
The remaining 30% of consumers are tested on auxiliary aspects that are unrelated to the model, and
are not relevant to this evaluation. Managers then created 75+ promotion bundles which comprise
the set of possible promotions that could be oﬀered to consumers in the campaign. Each consumer
could be oﬀered only one bundle during the campaign. Once scoring is completed for groups 1 and 2,
assignment of these promotion bundles is implemented in the following way. In group 1, each customer
is assigned the promotion bundle that provides the highest proﬁtability subject to making a minimum
threshold margin. The margin is set outside the model by management. If the expected proﬁtability
of the best oﬀer does not meet the margin threshold, no corporate promotion is sent to that consumer.

In group 2, consumers are sorted into segments as per the status quo method. Managers then assign
a segment-speciﬁc promotion bundle to each segment in the group in the same way as they have made
those decisions in the past. All corporate oﬀers are then emailed to consumers. The oﬀers are valid
for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012. All visits to any of the MGM properties along with
all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers are then tracked during the July 31 − Oct 31
window during which the promotion is active. No other corporate marketing was targeted at these
consumers at that time.

During the same period, the three groups are also exposed to non-corporate campaigns set in-
dependently by the MGM resorts’ individual property marketing teams. Thus, those in the control
and treatment groups receive other property-speciﬁc promotion oﬀers over and above those associated
with the corporate test. Hence, the performance of groups 1 and 2 relative to the control should
be interpreted as the net eﬀect of the corporate campaign relative to the existing property-speciﬁc
marketing activity. The promotions for the individual properties are mailed out in the Summer prior
to July, and are set independent of the corporate campaign; so they are not jointly allocated or adjust
in respond to the corporate level interventions in the test and control groups.10 These aspects of
the test-design derives from organizational considerations within the ﬁrm − organizationally, it was
not feasible to stop all property-speciﬁc promotional activity during the test period. Therefore, we
believe the test provides a lower bound on the performance of the new methods within the ﬁrm as a
whole, because further gains to what is assessed in the test can be had if property-speciﬁc campaigns
are also coordinated with the corporate campaign. Further, to the extent the new method is better,
implementing it at the individual properties as well would be the source of additional gains from the
adoption of the new analytics solution. Figure (12) presents the test design pictorially.

Table (2) reports the results. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, all dollar numbers in Table (2)
have been scaled by an undisclosed constant; so these should be interpreted as scaled dollars. When
we refer to revenues or costs below, we refer to these in scaled dollars, which we call units of “R$”
for brevity. Column 1 of Table (2) report on the results for Group 1, column 2 for Group 2 and the
last for the control. The top row of the table reports “adjusted” revenues for each group. These are
constructed by summing all gaming and non-gaming Theo from agents in a group that visited during
the July 31 − Oct 31 window, and subtracting out any Freeplay dollars used as well as the dollar
value of any MGM-speciﬁc reward points redeemed during that period. The company does not count
freeplay and reward point redemption as sources of real revenue, and considers this as the right metric
for assessing policy. Note this makes the adjusted revenues a more conservative metric of the gains
from a campaign. The next row reports the costs of the campaign across the three groups. These are
calculated as the net dollar value of promotions oﬀered. Other costs of running the campaign (e.g.,
printing direct mail) are not included. The costs row for groups 1 and 2 refer to the costs incurred
by the corporate team to run the campaign. The cost entry for the control group refer to the costs
incurred by the properties to run the other campaigns they conducted in parallel to the focal corporate
promotion.

Looking at Table (2), we see that net adjusted revenues from those who received the corporate

10Individual-properties also employ on-the-ﬂoor promotions like free-drinks allocated to playing patrons, that may
adjust to the consumer play behavior induced by our interventions. While we do not rule this kind of promotion
adjustment at the individual-property level, we believe the impact of these on our results is very small, as these kinds of
activities account for less than 5% of promotional spending by the properties. The bulk of property speciﬁc promotions
are mailed out and are pre-determined during the intervention period.

Figure 12: Test Design

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the design of the test conducted to evaluate the proposed model. Group A consumers were oﬀered

corporate promotions based on the model; Group B based on the status quo method; Group C (Control) consumers were

oﬀered no corporate promotions. All groups continued to receive promotions oﬀered by individual properties. The oﬀers are
valid for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012 and are mailed out in Summer 2012. All visits to any of the MGM
properties align with all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers in the test are then tracked during the July 31 −

Oct 31 window during which the promotion is active.

under the new model. Thus, adjusted revenues are higher under the new policy. We see net costs to
the corporate group are about R$41.42M under the new policy versus R$43.90M under the status-quo.
The upshot of the revenue and cost implications is about R$72.64M proﬁt to the casino under the new
policy compared to about R$68.07M under the status-quo. The diﬀerence is about R$4.57M for this
campaign. Even though we cannot disclose how much this is in real dollars, we are able to disclose a
range − in real dollars, this incremental diﬀerence is between $1 and $5M incremental proﬁt for the
ﬁrm.

The comparison to the control group is also informative about the relative proﬁtability of the new
method compared to the campaign strategies of the individual properties. Looking at the third column
in Table (2), we see that the various other campaigns run concurrently by the individual properties
brought in about R$36.8M of revenue from consumers in the control group. Recall that the control
is 1/3
rd the size of groups 1 and 2; so to obtain a relative comparison, we should multiply the dollars
in the control by 3. Computing scaled revenues 3×R$36.8M = R$110.4M, we see the new method
is superior in terms of revenues to the aggregated impact of the individual property campaigns as
well, bringing in about R$3.7M more (R$114.1M for the new policy vs. R$110.4M for the control).
Computing costs, the individual properties spent a scaled total of 3×R$14.5M = R$43.5M. The net
proﬁt impact is 3×R$22.2M = R$66.6M, which is less than the R$72.6M proﬁt associated with the
new policy. Note these comparisons are at the aggregate level, comparing the new method to the sum
total of the eﬀect across all 12 properties, and not a comparison of any one property’s method.

Computing a Return on Investment per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI
of about 2.75 compared to 2.53 for the individual properties, and 2.55 for the status-quo approach.
Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more incremental spending under the new
policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. As another metric, if the 4 campaigns in one year
each spent the same amount on promotions as the Summer campaign, at these levels of ROI, the ﬁrm
would make about R$33.6M (or between $10M and $15M in real dollars) in incremental proﬁt from
using the new model compared to the status-quo method, or about R$41.7M (or between $14M and
$19M in real dollars) in incremental revenues compared to the aggregation of the campaign planning
strategies of the individual properties.

9 Conclusions

Eﬀorts on developing and implementing a comprehensive marketing analytics solution for a real-world
company is presented. The framework leverages the richness of the company’s data to develop detailed
models of consumer behavior for use for optimized targeting. The models feature themes emphasized
in the academic marketing science literature, including incorporation of consumer heterogeneity and
state-dependence into utility, and the development of new methods for controlling for the endogene-
ity of the ﬁrm’s historical targeting rule in estimation. The issues discussed are relevant for other
customer-facing ﬁrms operating in data-rich environments that wish to improve their promotion tar-
geting and management using modern quantitative methods. The models are then assessed relative
to the status-quo using a large-scale ﬁeld intervention that shows the proﬁts from adopting the new
system are substantial. We believe the scale of model development and implementation and the com-
bination of the econometrics with a ﬁeld intervention in the context of a real-world ﬁrm are novel to

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

3

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation

tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

16

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

ability to scale rapidly to scoring large numbers of consumers. For instance, a speciﬁc campaign we
consider in the next section involves scoring about 2M consumers on close for 50+ promotional options.
The optimization package should also integrate well with the statistical models presented above, and
provide managers to ability to add constraints to the optimization in a user-friendly manner. We
implemented these on Teradata c(cid:13), a commercial database platform that is developed for Big Data
analytics applications.

On the optimization front, the main gain is the ability to customize promotions to each individual
consumer. Prior to our engagement, promotions were assigned at the segment-level. The new system
enabled optimizing promotions to the individual consumer-level, facilitating ﬁner micro-targeting.
Further, compared to the prior system, the number of bundles that could be considered increased
by about 6X, increasing the number of instruments available to improve promotion eﬃciency. With
additional hardware space and time, it is straightforward to scale up the system to accommodate even
larger bundle sets.

Finally, dashboard applications were also developed that enabled managers to monitor and dissect
company performance on their desktops. Figure (11) provides an example. These dashboards were
linked to the underlying statistical model and optimization packages, so as to embed the framework
in a user-friendly decision support system.

This completes the discussion of the model framework and development eﬀort.

8 Results from a Randomized Evaluation

The models developed above are assessed as part of a large-scale randomized test at MGM. We imple-
ment the test as part of the Summer 2012 corporate campaign. The test evaluates the performance
of the model in selecting consumers to whom a set of promotion bundles could be targeted, as well as
the ability of the model to match consumers to one of these promotion bundles.

The test involves about 2M customers, picked from MGM’s prospect database. The goal of the test
is to compare the eﬃcacy of the model in promotional targeting relative to the status quo approach
used at the ﬁrm. The test is implemented as follows. First, a pilot test was conducted in Spring 2012
with a limited number of promotional oﬀerings to assess test design, understand ball-park customer
response and to understand logistics of implementation. Based on this, the 2M consumers in the
prospect data are randomly divided into 3 groups prior to the beginning of summer. Group 1 con-
sumers (30% of the total) are scored on the model we develop. Group 2 (30% of the total) consumers
are scored based on the status-quo approach (Theo on last visit and demographics). Group 3 con-
sumers (10% of the total) are treated as the control – they do not receive any of the corporate oﬀers.
The remaining 30% of consumers are tested on auxiliary aspects that are unrelated to the model, and
are not relevant to this evaluation. Managers then created 75+ promotion bundles which comprise
the set of possible promotions that could be oﬀered to consumers in the campaign. Each consumer
could be oﬀered only one bundle during the campaign. Once scoring is completed for groups 1 and 2,
assignment of these promotion bundles is implemented in the following way. In group 1, each customer
is assigned the promotion bundle that provides the highest proﬁtability subject to making a minimum
threshold margin. The margin is set outside the model by management. If the expected proﬁtability
of the best oﬀer does not meet the margin threshold, no corporate promotion is sent to that consumer.

In group 2, consumers are sorted into segments as per the status quo method. Managers then assign
a segment-speciﬁc promotion bundle to each segment in the group in the same way as they have made
those decisions in the past. All corporate oﬀers are then emailed to consumers. The oﬀers are valid
for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012. All visits to any of the MGM properties along with
all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers are then tracked during the July 31 − Oct 31
window during which the promotion is active. No other corporate marketing was targeted at these
consumers at that time.

During the same period, the three groups are also exposed to non-corporate campaigns set in-
dependently by the MGM resorts’ individual property marketing teams. Thus, those in the control
and treatment groups receive other property-speciﬁc promotion oﬀers over and above those associated
with the corporate test. Hence, the performance of groups 1 and 2 relative to the control should
be interpreted as the net eﬀect of the corporate campaign relative to the existing property-speciﬁc
marketing activity. The promotions for the individual properties are mailed out in the Summer prior
to July, and are set independent of the corporate campaign; so they are not jointly allocated or adjust
in respond to the corporate level interventions in the test and control groups.10 These aspects of
the test-design derives from organizational considerations within the ﬁrm − organizationally, it was
not feasible to stop all property-speciﬁc promotional activity during the test period. Therefore, we
believe the test provides a lower bound on the performance of the new methods within the ﬁrm as a
whole, because further gains to what is assessed in the test can be had if property-speciﬁc campaigns
are also coordinated with the corporate campaign. Further, to the extent the new method is better,
implementing it at the individual properties as well would be the source of additional gains from the
adoption of the new analytics solution. Figure (12) presents the test design pictorially.

Table (2) reports the results. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, all dollar numbers in Table (2)
have been scaled by an undisclosed constant; so these should be interpreted as scaled dollars. When
we refer to revenues or costs below, we refer to these in scaled dollars, which we call units of “R$”
for brevity. Column 1 of Table (2) report on the results for Group 1, column 2 for Group 2 and the
last for the control. The top row of the table reports “adjusted” revenues for each group. These are
constructed by summing all gaming and non-gaming Theo from agents in a group that visited during
the July 31 − Oct 31 window, and subtracting out any Freeplay dollars used as well as the dollar
value of any MGM-speciﬁc reward points redeemed during that period. The company does not count
freeplay and reward point redemption as sources of real revenue, and considers this as the right metric
for assessing policy. Note this makes the adjusted revenues a more conservative metric of the gains
from a campaign. The next row reports the costs of the campaign across the three groups. These are
calculated as the net dollar value of promotions oﬀered. Other costs of running the campaign (e.g.,
printing direct mail) are not included. The costs row for groups 1 and 2 refer to the costs incurred
by the corporate team to run the campaign. The cost entry for the control group refer to the costs
incurred by the properties to run the other campaigns they conducted in parallel to the focal corporate
promotion.

Looking at Table (2), we see that net adjusted revenues from those who received the corporate

10Individual-properties also employ on-the-ﬂoor promotions like free-drinks allocated to playing patrons, that may
adjust to the consumer play behavior induced by our interventions. While we do not rule this kind of promotion
adjustment at the individual-property level, we believe the impact of these on our results is very small, as these kinds of
activities account for less than 5% of promotional spending by the properties. The bulk of property speciﬁc promotions
are mailed out and are pre-determined during the intervention period.

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the design of the test conducted to evaluate the proposed model. Group A consumers were oﬀered

corporate promotions based on the model; Group B based on the status quo method; Group C (Control) consumers were

oﬀered no corporate promotions. All groups continued to receive promotions oﬀered by individual properties. The oﬀers are
valid for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012 and are mailed out in Summer 2012. All visits to any of the MGM
properties align with all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers in the test are then tracked during the July 31 −

under the new model. Thus, adjusted revenues are higher under the new policy. We see net costs to
the corporate group are about R$41.42M under the new policy versus R$43.90M under the status-quo.
The upshot of the revenue and cost implications is about R$72.64M proﬁt to the casino under the new
policy compared to about R$68.07M under the status-quo. The diﬀerence is about R$4.57M for this
campaign. Even though we cannot disclose how much this is in real dollars, we are able to disclose a
range − in real dollars, this incremental diﬀerence is between $1 and $5M incremental proﬁt for the
ﬁrm.

The comparison to the control group is also informative about the relative proﬁtability of the new
method compared to the campaign strategies of the individual properties. Looking at the third column
in Table (2), we see that the various other campaigns run concurrently by the individual properties
brought in about R$36.8M of revenue from consumers in the control group. Recall that the control
is 1/3
rd the size of groups 1 and 2; so to obtain a relative comparison, we should multiply the dollars
in the control by 3. Computing scaled revenues 3×R$36.8M = R$110.4M, we see the new method
is superior in terms of revenues to the aggregated impact of the individual property campaigns as
well, bringing in about R$3.7M more (R$114.1M for the new policy vs. R$110.4M for the control).
Computing costs, the individual properties spent a scaled total of 3×R$14.5M = R$43.5M. The net
proﬁt impact is 3×R$22.2M = R$66.6M, which is less than the R$72.6M proﬁt associated with the
new policy. Note these comparisons are at the aggregate level, comparing the new method to the sum
total of the eﬀect across all 12 properties, and not a comparison of any one property’s method.

Computing a Return on Investment per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI
of about 2.75 compared to 2.53 for the individual properties, and 2.55 for the status-quo approach.
Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more incremental spending under the new
policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. As another metric, if the 4 campaigns in one year
each spent the same amount on promotions as the Summer campaign, at these levels of ROI, the ﬁrm
would make about R$33.6M (or between $10M and $15M in real dollars) in incremental proﬁt from
using the new model compared to the status-quo method, or about R$41.7M (or between $14M and
$19M in real dollars) in incremental revenues compared to the aggregation of the campaign planning
strategies of the individual properties.

9 Conclusions

Eﬀorts on developing and implementing a comprehensive marketing analytics solution for a real-world
company is presented. The framework leverages the richness of the company’s data to develop detailed
models of consumer behavior for use for optimized targeting. The models feature themes emphasized
in the academic marketing science literature, including incorporation of consumer heterogeneity and
state-dependence into utility, and the development of new methods for controlling for the endogene-
ity of the ﬁrm’s historical targeting rule in estimation. The issues discussed are relevant for other
customer-facing ﬁrms operating in data-rich environments that wish to improve their promotion tar-
geting and management using modern quantitative methods. The models are then assessed relative
to the status-quo using a large-scale ﬁeld intervention that shows the proﬁts from adopting the new
system are substantial. We believe the scale of model development and implementation and the com-
bination of the econometrics with a ﬁeld intervention in the context of a real-world ﬁrm are novel to

the marketing science literature.

For academics wishing to port marketing science models from theory to practice, our experience
in model building holds a few lessons. First, heterogeneity in consumer behavior is extensive. A large
number of segments are required to capture the amount of heterogeneity seen in the data. Even with
R = 50+ segments, we could detect signiﬁcant amount of within-segment heterogeneity, some of which
we do not model simply on account of practical diﬃculties, and for ease of model implementation and
simplicity in use and exposition. We try to capture much of this by including functions of past behavior
into the model (along with demographics).

Second, even with this extensive segmentation, we have a large number of observations in each
bucket, a luxury aﬀorded by the Big Data revolution of recent years. Because of this, we found we are
able to estimate most of our eﬀects fairly precisely and that issues of sampling error associated with
data sparsity, often a signiﬁcant issue in academic work, are not at the forefront in this setting. Rather,
practical signiﬁcance and not statistical signiﬁcance becomes the salient issue in model selection.

Third, ﬁtting the data well often requires inclusion of variables numbering in the hundreds. More
generally, the advent of database marketing, the integration of marketing with technology, and the
proliferation of instruments by which to incentivize and reach consumers imply that a large number of
marketing metrics are now tracked at ﬁrms. Incorporating these into econometric models while allow-
ing for ﬂexible speciﬁcations that include main and interaction eﬀects imply systems with hundreds
of variables. Thus, software that can manage the scale of both data and the variable set become key.
Also key are statistical methods that scale well. For instance, maximizing a likelihood over a large
set of parameters with a large number of observations becomes quickly problematic if the objective
functions are not smooth and the likelihood is not concave. Hence, in such situations, models like
the logit that have well deﬁned, smooth and concave objective functions, and scale well in variables,
become vey attractive.

Fourth, we ﬁnd that thinking structurally about the data generating process is very important in
assessing the historical variation in the data and in using it to formulate policy. In our setting, we
found that accommodating the ﬁrm’s historical targeting rule in inference was critical to measuring
the right eﬀect of promotions, and for guarding against recommending a signiﬁcant ramping up of
promotions when using the estimated parameters for formulating marketing policy.

Fifth, in many large organizations, getting an analytics project oﬀ the ground involves a signiﬁcant
ﬁxed cost associated with data collation and cleaning. It is typical that data are spread across various
units within the organization, that some parts of the data are “dirty” or missing, and that some data
are available only in unstructured or non-digital form. Thus an academic or consulting company
engaging in an analytics eﬀort with the organization should expect to invest a signiﬁcant amount of
upfront time and eﬀort in data cleaning and scrubbing. In our view, this component of the engagement
is of critical importance, and reaps large investments because the value of the subsequent modeling is
driven to a great degree by the richness and quality of data inputs.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.

and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more

and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

3Examples of risk-sharing for high-rollers include returning a negotiated percentage of losses back to the consumer.

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

3.1 Nested Logit Model of Visit and Property Choice

We model the discrete-choice of whether to visit the casino in a given month, y(1)
of which property to visit, y(1)

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

(2)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt
1+(cid:80)J

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)
exp(vijt)
j=1 exp(vijt)

ijt = 1) =
, where the consumer-speciﬁc attractiveness of property j in month t, vijt, is speciﬁed

k=1

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of
ij
the MGM properties in a month t is by construction, Pr(y(1)

i0t = 1) = 1 −(cid:80)J

k=1 Pr(y(1)

ijt = 1).

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

16

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

ability to scale rapidly to scoring large numbers of consumers. For instance, a speciﬁc campaign we
consider in the next section involves scoring about 2M consumers on close for 50+ promotional options.
The optimization package should also integrate well with the statistical models presented above, and
provide managers to ability to add constraints to the optimization in a user-friendly manner. We
implemented these on Teradata c(cid:13), a commercial database platform that is developed for Big Data
analytics applications.

On the optimization front, the main gain is the ability to customize promotions to each individual
consumer. Prior to our engagement, promotions were assigned at the segment-level. The new system
enabled optimizing promotions to the individual consumer-level, facilitating ﬁner micro-targeting.
Further, compared to the prior system, the number of bundles that could be considered increased
by about 6X, increasing the number of instruments available to improve promotion eﬃciency. With
additional hardware space and time, it is straightforward to scale up the system to accommodate even
larger bundle sets.

Finally, dashboard applications were also developed that enabled managers to monitor and dissect
company performance on their desktops. Figure (11) provides an example. These dashboards were
linked to the underlying statistical model and optimization packages, so as to embed the framework
in a user-friendly decision support system.

This completes the discussion of the model framework and development eﬀort.

8 Results from a Randomized Evaluation

The models developed above are assessed as part of a large-scale randomized test at MGM. We imple-
ment the test as part of the Summer 2012 corporate campaign. The test evaluates the performance
of the model in selecting consumers to whom a set of promotion bundles could be targeted, as well as
the ability of the model to match consumers to one of these promotion bundles.

The test involves about 2M customers, picked from MGM’s prospect database. The goal of the test
is to compare the eﬃcacy of the model in promotional targeting relative to the status quo approach
used at the ﬁrm. The test is implemented as follows. First, a pilot test was conducted in Spring 2012
with a limited number of promotional oﬀerings to assess test design, understand ball-park customer
response and to understand logistics of implementation. Based on this, the 2M consumers in the
prospect data are randomly divided into 3 groups prior to the beginning of summer. Group 1 con-
sumers (30% of the total) are scored on the model we develop. Group 2 (30% of the total) consumers
are scored based on the status-quo approach (Theo on last visit and demographics). Group 3 con-
sumers (10% of the total) are treated as the control – they do not receive any of the corporate oﬀers.
The remaining 30% of consumers are tested on auxiliary aspects that are unrelated to the model, and
are not relevant to this evaluation. Managers then created 75+ promotion bundles which comprise
the set of possible promotions that could be oﬀered to consumers in the campaign. Each consumer
could be oﬀered only one bundle during the campaign. Once scoring is completed for groups 1 and 2,
assignment of these promotion bundles is implemented in the following way. In group 1, each customer
is assigned the promotion bundle that provides the highest proﬁtability subject to making a minimum
threshold margin. The margin is set outside the model by management. If the expected proﬁtability
of the best oﬀer does not meet the margin threshold, no corporate promotion is sent to that consumer.

In group 2, consumers are sorted into segments as per the status quo method. Managers then assign
a segment-speciﬁc promotion bundle to each segment in the group in the same way as they have made
those decisions in the past. All corporate oﬀers are then emailed to consumers. The oﬀers are valid
for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012. All visits to any of the MGM properties along with
all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers are then tracked during the July 31 − Oct 31
window during which the promotion is active. No other corporate marketing was targeted at these
consumers at that time.

During the same period, the three groups are also exposed to non-corporate campaigns set in-
dependently by the MGM resorts’ individual property marketing teams. Thus, those in the control
and treatment groups receive other property-speciﬁc promotion oﬀers over and above those associated
with the corporate test. Hence, the performance of groups 1 and 2 relative to the control should
be interpreted as the net eﬀect of the corporate campaign relative to the existing property-speciﬁc
marketing activity. The promotions for the individual properties are mailed out in the Summer prior
to July, and are set independent of the corporate campaign; so they are not jointly allocated or adjust
in respond to the corporate level interventions in the test and control groups.10 These aspects of
the test-design derives from organizational considerations within the ﬁrm − organizationally, it was
not feasible to stop all property-speciﬁc promotional activity during the test period. Therefore, we
believe the test provides a lower bound on the performance of the new methods within the ﬁrm as a
whole, because further gains to what is assessed in the test can be had if property-speciﬁc campaigns
are also coordinated with the corporate campaign. Further, to the extent the new method is better,
implementing it at the individual properties as well would be the source of additional gains from the
adoption of the new analytics solution. Figure (12) presents the test design pictorially.

Table (2) reports the results. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, all dollar numbers in Table (2)
have been scaled by an undisclosed constant; so these should be interpreted as scaled dollars. When
we refer to revenues or costs below, we refer to these in scaled dollars, which we call units of “R$”
for brevity. Column 1 of Table (2) report on the results for Group 1, column 2 for Group 2 and the
last for the control. The top row of the table reports “adjusted” revenues for each group. These are
constructed by summing all gaming and non-gaming Theo from agents in a group that visited during
the July 31 − Oct 31 window, and subtracting out any Freeplay dollars used as well as the dollar
value of any MGM-speciﬁc reward points redeemed during that period. The company does not count
freeplay and reward point redemption as sources of real revenue, and considers this as the right metric
for assessing policy. Note this makes the adjusted revenues a more conservative metric of the gains
from a campaign. The next row reports the costs of the campaign across the three groups. These are
calculated as the net dollar value of promotions oﬀered. Other costs of running the campaign (e.g.,
printing direct mail) are not included. The costs row for groups 1 and 2 refer to the costs incurred
by the corporate team to run the campaign. The cost entry for the control group refer to the costs
incurred by the properties to run the other campaigns they conducted in parallel to the focal corporate
promotion.

Looking at Table (2), we see that net adjusted revenues from those who received the corporate

10Individual-properties also employ on-the-ﬂoor promotions like free-drinks allocated to playing patrons, that may
adjust to the consumer play behavior induced by our interventions. While we do not rule this kind of promotion
adjustment at the individual-property level, we believe the impact of these on our results is very small, as these kinds of
activities account for less than 5% of promotional spending by the properties. The bulk of property speciﬁc promotions
are mailed out and are pre-determined during the intervention period.

Figure 12: Test Design

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the design of the test conducted to evaluate the proposed model. Group A consumers were oﬀered

corporate promotions based on the model; Group B based on the status quo method; Group C (Control) consumers were

oﬀered no corporate promotions. All groups continued to receive promotions oﬀered by individual properties. The oﬀers are
valid for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012 and are mailed out in Summer 2012. All visits to any of the MGM
properties align with all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers in the test are then tracked during the July 31 −

Oct 31 window during which the promotion is active.

under the new model. Thus, adjusted revenues are higher under the new policy. We see net costs to
the corporate group are about R$41.42M under the new policy versus R$43.90M under the status-quo.
The upshot of the revenue and cost implications is about R$72.64M proﬁt to the casino under the new
policy compared to about R$68.07M under the status-quo. The diﬀerence is about R$4.57M for this
campaign. Even though we cannot disclose how much this is in real dollars, we are able to disclose a
range − in real dollars, this incremental diﬀerence is between $1 and $5M incremental proﬁt for the
ﬁrm.

The comparison to the control group is also informative about the relative proﬁtability of the new
method compared to the campaign strategies of the individual properties. Looking at the third column
in Table (2), we see that the various other campaigns run concurrently by the individual properties
brought in about R$36.8M of revenue from consumers in the control group. Recall that the control
is 1/3
rd the size of groups 1 and 2; so to obtain a relative comparison, we should multiply the dollars
in the control by 3. Computing scaled revenues 3×R$36.8M = R$110.4M, we see the new method
is superior in terms of revenues to the aggregated impact of the individual property campaigns as
well, bringing in about R$3.7M more (R$114.1M for the new policy vs. R$110.4M for the control).
Computing costs, the individual properties spent a scaled total of 3×R$14.5M = R$43.5M. The net
proﬁt impact is 3×R$22.2M = R$66.6M, which is less than the R$72.6M proﬁt associated with the
new policy. Note these comparisons are at the aggregate level, comparing the new method to the sum
total of the eﬀect across all 12 properties, and not a comparison of any one property’s method.

Computing a Return on Investment per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI
of about 2.75 compared to 2.53 for the individual properties, and 2.55 for the status-quo approach.
Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more incremental spending under the new
policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. As another metric, if the 4 campaigns in one year
each spent the same amount on promotions as the Summer campaign, at these levels of ROI, the ﬁrm
would make about R$33.6M (or between $10M and $15M in real dollars) in incremental proﬁt from
using the new model compared to the status-quo method, or about R$41.7M (or between $14M and
$19M in real dollars) in incremental revenues compared to the aggregation of the campaign planning
strategies of the individual properties.

9 Conclusions

Eﬀorts on developing and implementing a comprehensive marketing analytics solution for a real-world
company is presented. The framework leverages the richness of the company’s data to develop detailed
models of consumer behavior for use for optimized targeting. The models feature themes emphasized
in the academic marketing science literature, including incorporation of consumer heterogeneity and
state-dependence into utility, and the development of new methods for controlling for the endogene-
ity of the ﬁrm’s historical targeting rule in estimation. The issues discussed are relevant for other
customer-facing ﬁrms operating in data-rich environments that wish to improve their promotion tar-
geting and management using modern quantitative methods. The models are then assessed relative
to the status-quo using a large-scale ﬁeld intervention that shows the proﬁts from adopting the new
system are substantial. We believe the scale of model development and implementation and the com-
bination of the econometrics with a ﬁeld intervention in the context of a real-world ﬁrm are novel to

the marketing science literature.

For academics wishing to port marketing science models from theory to practice, our experience
in model building holds a few lessons. First, heterogeneity in consumer behavior is extensive. A large
number of segments are required to capture the amount of heterogeneity seen in the data. Even with
R = 50+ segments, we could detect signiﬁcant amount of within-segment heterogeneity, some of which
we do not model simply on account of practical diﬃculties, and for ease of model implementation and
simplicity in use and exposition. We try to capture much of this by including functions of past behavior
into the model (along with demographics).

Second, even with this extensive segmentation, we have a large number of observations in each
bucket, a luxury aﬀorded by the Big Data revolution of recent years. Because of this, we found we are
able to estimate most of our eﬀects fairly precisely and that issues of sampling error associated with
data sparsity, often a signiﬁcant issue in academic work, are not at the forefront in this setting. Rather,
practical signiﬁcance and not statistical signiﬁcance becomes the salient issue in model selection.

Third, ﬁtting the data well often requires inclusion of variables numbering in the hundreds. More
generally, the advent of database marketing, the integration of marketing with technology, and the
proliferation of instruments by which to incentivize and reach consumers imply that a large number of
marketing metrics are now tracked at ﬁrms. Incorporating these into econometric models while allow-
ing for ﬂexible speciﬁcations that include main and interaction eﬀects imply systems with hundreds
of variables. Thus, software that can manage the scale of both data and the variable set become key.
Also key are statistical methods that scale well. For instance, maximizing a likelihood over a large
set of parameters with a large number of observations becomes quickly problematic if the objective
functions are not smooth and the likelihood is not concave. Hence, in such situations, models like
the logit that have well deﬁned, smooth and concave objective functions, and scale well in variables,
become vey attractive.

Fourth, we ﬁnd that thinking structurally about the data generating process is very important in
assessing the historical variation in the data and in using it to formulate policy. In our setting, we
found that accommodating the ﬁrm’s historical targeting rule in inference was critical to measuring
the right eﬀect of promotions, and for guarding against recommending a signiﬁcant ramping up of
promotions when using the estimated parameters for formulating marketing policy.

Fifth, in many large organizations, getting an analytics project oﬀ the ground involves a signiﬁcant
ﬁxed cost associated with data collation and cleaning. It is typical that data are spread across various
units within the organization, that some parts of the data are “dirty” or missing, and that some data
are available only in unstructured or non-digital form. Thus an academic or consulting company
engaging in an analytics eﬀort with the organization should expect to invest a signiﬁcant amount of
upfront time and eﬀort in data cleaning and scrubbing. In our view, this component of the engagement
is of critical importance, and reaps large investments because the value of the subsequent modeling is
driven to a great degree by the richness and quality of data inputs.

Abstract

This paper reports on the development and implementation of a large-scale, marketing analyt-
ics framework for improving the segmentation, targeting and optimization of a consumer-facing
ﬁrm’s marketing activities. The framework leverages detailed transaction data of the type in-
creasingly becoming available in such industries. The models are customized to facilitate casino
operations and implemented at the MGM Resorts International’s group of companies. The core of
the framework consists of empirical models of consumer casino visitation and play behavior and its
relationship to targeted marketing eﬀort. Important aspects of the models include incorporation
of rich dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in
consumer behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all
issues that are salient in modern empirical marketing research. The paper discusses details of
the models as well as practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into
implementable solutions in the ﬁeld. A novel aspect of the paper is an analysis of a randomized
trial implemented at the ﬁrm involving about 2M consumers comparing the performance of the
proposed marketing-science based models to the existing status quo. We ﬁnd the impact of the
solution is to produce about $1M to $5M incremental proﬁts per campaign, and about an 8%
improvement in the Return on Investment of marketing dollars. At current levels of marketing
spending, this translates to between $10M and $15M in incremental annual proﬁt in this set-
ting. More generally, we believe the results showcase the value of combining large, disaggregate,
individual-level datasets with marketing analytics solutions for improving outcomes for ﬁrms in
real-world settings. We hope our demonstrated improvement from analytics adoption help accel-
erate faster diﬀusion of marketing science into practice.

Introduction

The advent of “Big Data,” and the associated ability to track and measure the behavior of consumers
has had a disruptive eﬀect on many industries particularly in the way marketing is conducted and
evaluated. By improving the ability to micro-target consumers, and by driving the rise of “evidence-
based management” in which decisions are supported by data, the measurability of marketing has
improved and several issues like advertising and promotions are now routinely treated as quantitative
problems. We describe a marketing analytics system we developed in one industry − gaming and
gambling − where transactional-level data on consumer play behavior along with targeted marketing
information at ﬁne levels of resolution are now abundant. We show that combining the richness of
the data with theory-based empirical models and a state-of-the art optimization system signiﬁcantly
improves the Return on Investment (ROI) of marketing eﬀort at the ﬁrm, and dramatically improves
the proﬁtability of targeted marketing.

In a large-scale randomized ﬁeld evaluation, we ﬁnd the new system produces between $1M to
$5M dollars of incremental proﬁts per campaign compared to the status-quo policy when used to
target marketing at a randomly picked group of consumers in the ﬁrm’s database. The source of the
improvement arises from shifting marketing dollars away from average consumers who would have
played even in the absence of the promotion towards marginal consumers for whom the promotion
has an incremental impact; and from the improved matching of promotion types to consumer types.
Computing an ROI per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI of about 2.75 compared
to 2.55 for the status-quo approach. Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more
incremental spending under the new policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. Assuming
this diﬀerence is the best estimate of the incremental proﬁt from the new model, this translates to
approximately between $10M and $15M in incremental proﬁt from shifting from the status-quo to
the new model, assuming same level of marketing spends. Taken together, we believe these numbers
suggest the new policy is successful, and serves to demonstrate the power of marketing analytics in
the ﬁeld.

We developed the new marketing analytics system in collaboration with ESS Analysis, a consulting
company, for implementation at MGM Resorts International (henceforth “MGM”), a large gaming and
hospitality company based in Las Vegas, NV. The ﬁrm manages 11 casinos in Las Vegas including
well known portfolio brands like The Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. The
engagement at MGM began in 2010. The models were implemented at MGM in late 2011. The
randomized experiments to evaluate the new model were implemented in Spring and Summer of 2012.
The project ﬁts into the rising trend of analytics transforming customer facing industries, including the
gaming industry. The project is part of MGM’s strategic initiatives to use industry-leading analytics
to improve the consumer experience at their properties, and to channelize the allocation of the right
set of promotions to the right set of their customers.

The core of the framework is built on empirical models of consumer behavior all of which have
its genesis in the marketing science literature. While the models are tailored to the casino and
gaming setting, important aspects of the models that cut across contexts include incorporation of rich
dimensions of heterogeneity in consumer response, accommodation of state-dependence in consumer
behavior, as well as controls for the endogeneity of targeted marketing in inference, all issues that
are salient in modern empirical marketing research. We discuss details of the models as well as

2

practical issues involved in translating econometric models of this sort into implementable solutions
in the ﬁeld. Along the way, we also propose new ways to accommodate the endogeneity implied
by nonrandom historical targeting by the ﬁrm in the estimation of empirical models that utilize the
ﬁrm’s transactional data. Our solution is simple to implement and exploits the internal information
of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. We expect it to be useful in other situations in
which researchers work closely with ﬁrms and have some knowledge of the ﬁrm’s past targeting rule.
We also discuss generalizable learnings for academics interested in diﬀusing science to practice that
may be relevant in other settings. Our ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate estimated
models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables in
each model, and over 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. We believe the scale of the
model development and implementation, and the evaluation of its impact via a large-scale randomized
ﬁeld experiment is novel to the marketing literature. We also add to a burgeoning literature that has
combined econometric models with ﬁeld interventions to improve and assess marketing models and
policies.1

In 1970, John Little noted with concern that,

“The big problem with management science models is managers practically never use them.
There have been a few applications, of course, but practice is a pallid picture of the
promise.” (Little 1970).

See Bucklin and Gupta (1999); Leeﬂang and Wittink (2000); Roberts (2000); Winer (2000); Lodish
(2001); Sinha and Zoltners (2001); Van Bruggen and Wierenga (2001) for various perspectives on the
research practice divide. We believe that the availability of large quantities of consumer-level data
and the increased recognition of the power of analytics provides for guarded optimism that the trend
has turned in the other direction in 2010-s: we are witnessing a rapid diﬀusion of models built on
Marketing Science into practice in recent times. We hope our demonstrated improvement from the
adoption of a model-based approach to Marketing accelerates this productive collaboration between
academic and industry even further.

The rest of the paper discusses the industry context, describes the model framework, discusses the

data and results, and presents the results from the ﬁeld evaluation.

2 Background on Gaming

The market for gaming is part of the hospitality and entertainment sector of the economy. Estimates
place the size of the market at about $35.6B in 2011.2 The market is big.
In 2011, the gaming
industry employed an estimated 339,098 people who earned $12.9 billion in wages, beneﬁts and tips.
Commercial casinos also paid about $7.9 billion states and localities in the form of direct gaming
taxes. Market research by VP Communications, Inc. and pollster Peter D. Hart, reports that more
1Some studies in this growing area include Mantrala et al. 2006 (pricing aftermarket goods); Cho and Rust 2008
(automobile replacement); Simester et al. 2009 (catalog mailing); Sahni 2012 (online advertising); Misra and Nair 2011
and Kishore et al. 2013 (salesforce compensation). Anderson and Simester (2011) discuss ﬁeld experiments in Marketing
and Lilien et al. (2013) review papers associated with the ISMS practice prize for applications of Marketing Science
models within ﬁrms in the real-world.

2Based on commercial Casino revenues reported in AGA (2012). Commercial casinos are proﬁt-making businesses
owned by individuals, private companies, or large public corporations. The term “commercial Casino” is used in the
United States to indicate a gaming facility that is not owned and operated on Native American lands by a tribal
government.

Figure 1: Comparing U.S. Gaming Revenues to Other Entertainment Spending (AGA, 2012)

than one-quarter (27%) of the U.S. adult population visited a Casino during 2011, totaling about 59.7
million people (AGA 2012). Figure 1 compares annual consumer spending in commercial casinos to
that in a variety of other entertainment channels. Commercial casinos ranked third, ahead of music,
outdoor equipment and box oﬃce receipts. As American recreational spending rises over the last
decade, the share of the spending on gaming grew more quickly than any other component of the
recreation sector (see Figure 2; Bazalon et al. 2012). Clearly, gaming is an important part of the
entertainment economy.

Within the commercial Casino market, the state of Nevada alone accounts for about 30% of total
revenues ($10.7B in 2011). Gambling in Nevada started in the 1800s, but was formally legalized in
1931 as a way of generating jobs in the aftermath of the great depression. Commercial casinos started
oﬀ in Las Vegas, NV in the 1940-s with the opening of El Ranco Vegas, the ﬁrst Casino, and later,
the well-known Flamingo Hotel and Casino started by the mobster, “Bugsy” Siegel. After the U.S.
Congress passed the Racketeer Inﬂuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in 1970, the early inﬂuence
of organized crime in the Casino business reduced and commercial Casino management became more
professionalized (Encyclopedia.com, 2012). In 2011, the gaming revenues of the roughly 40+ casinos
on the 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard known as “the Strip” alone accounted for approximately
US$6.1B. This makes this area the top commercial Casino market in the country. Figure 3 depicts
the Casinos on the Strip. There is considerable agglomeration. The consolidation helps in demand
aggregation, but also results in an intense competitive environment for casinos on the Strip. As the
while, casinos on the Strip also face competition from the growth of international markets like Macau,
as well as the gradual relaxation of gambling rules across states within the US.

We now discuss some key aspects of casinos that are relevant to understanding the context in

which a marketing analytics solution is developed.

Casinos and Product Diﬀerentiation

At a broad level, commercial casinos in the U.S. are diﬀerentiated in scale and scope into two types,
namely destination casino resorts and regional casinos (Bazalon et al. 2012). Destination Casino
resorts are large facilities oﬀering gaming, entertainment, retail and convention facilities, and involve
development costs that often exceed over a billion USD. Destination casino resorts attract visitors
from all over the world. Regional casinos are smaller operations, catering mostly to customers within
driving distance, and focused primarily on gaming. The mix of destination versus regional casinos
in a location is determined by a variety of regulatory, demand and competitive factors. Most of the

Figure 3: Agglomeration of Commercial Casinos on the Las Vegas “Strip”

5

casinos on the “Strip” tend to be destination casinos.

Destination casinos are multi-product ﬁrms providing bundles of entertainment, lodging, retail
and gambling options to consumers. A key feature is complementarities in demand across oﬀerings.
Good lodging, entertainment, and food and beverage (henceforth F&B) options attracts patrons, who
in turn stay longer and spend more on recreational activities. Consequently, casinos often implement
loss-leader pricing on several oﬀerings, particularly on lodging and F&B, in combination with targeted
price and promotion discrimination. Casinos target high value consumers with subsides on stays and
perks and oﬀset these promotional costs with the option value of increased spending by the targeted
consumers. Identifying such consumers and ﬁnding the right mix of promotions to oﬀer them then
becomes a key component of the business model of the ﬁrm. In 2010, commercial casinos in the US
earned about 69% of their revenues from gaming, 13.2% from F&B, 10.4% from Hotel and lodging
and and the remaining 7.1% from other activities (e.g. golf, spa, concerts).

Marketing and the Challenge of Targeting

The proliferation of gaming outlets as well as the agglomeration of several competing options on
locations like the “Strip” implies competition for consumers is intense. Hence, Marketing becomes
very important for driving revenue. Casinos oﬀer a variety of promotions to consumers including dis-
counted rooms and entertainment tickets, credits for subsidized play at slots and tables (referred to as
“free-play”), discounts on food/drinks, as well as concierge service, subsidized credit and risk-sharing
agreements to high-spending “high-roller” consumers.3 These oﬀers or “comps” − short for “comple-
mentary” − are marketed via a variety of channels including direct-mail, email, online advertising,
and banners. Much of marketing eﬀort is targeted. As a general rule, more attractive promotions are
oﬀered to those that are expected to play more.

Targeting in the gaming context is a complicated problem. The extent of consumer heterogeneity is
huge, which complicates the task of determining the consumers with the highest marginal propensity to
respond to a promotion. Casinos face the task of simultaneously attracting high-spending consumers
while avoiding highly skilled “experts” who win back from the house more than they wager. Casinos
would also like to avoid consumers who utilize comps but do not play at the resort. They would also like
to avoid consumers who wager nothing more than their free-play dollars, thereby gaining the upside
from the promotion, with little downside for themselves and no gain for the house. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to sort out desirable consumers from undesirable ones based on observed socio-demographic
characteristics, leading to a diﬃcult adverse selection problem. Casinos attempt to solve some of
these diﬃculties by using history-dependent marketing policies, targeting oﬀers based on functions of
a consumer’s observed past play behavior (more on this below). Unfortunately, application of this
policy over time has caused consumer expectations to adjust. Many consumers now expect free-play
and comps to be automatically allocated when they spend more, and may even stop patronizing
a casino if it does not oﬀer them signiﬁcant comping. Consequently, comp-activity and promotional
spending in Vegas casinos has grown signiﬁcantly in recent years, and many industry observers feel that
much of comping does not drive incremental demand, being delivered to many without measurable
incremental eﬀect on spending. While in the past, comping was a seen as a reward that had the
causal eﬀect of increasing play spending, now, many believe some consumers see it as a pre-condition
to spending. Past comping has creating in eﬀect, a “comp-sensitive” segment, a form of moral-hazard

caused by targeted marketing policies. In addition, when casinos that promote more also attract more
“comp-sensitive” consumers, the adverse selection problem is also deepened. Both issues accentuate
the diﬃculty of targeting and optimizing marketing eﬀort in this setting. Moreover, there is also an
overarching concern that targeting more promotions to those who have played a lot in the past may
be ineﬀective, because those consumers may already be the ﬂat or declining part of their promotion
response curve. The history-based allocation may then be targeting promotions to those who would
have played anyway, which ends up losing money. These issues have parallels to issues faced by ﬁrms
in other industries in managing their long-run promotion policies (for e.g., manufacturers oﬀering
automobile promotions to car-buyers, retail sales to apparel consumers, and trade-promotions to
retailers have been concerned that promotions end up losing money due to analogous reasons to
above).

A second complication is ﬁnding the right match between promotions and consumer preferences.
Diﬀerent consumers have diﬀerent preferences over hotel rooms, F&B or free-play oﬀers. An ideal
policy will target a mix of promotions to each consumer based on what produces maximal marginal
beneﬁt at minimal cost. Operationalizing this requires a disaggregate model of heterogeneous con-
sumer tastes that can be made the basis of individual-level policy making. Many casinos lack such
sophisticated analytics capabilities. While casinos have made signiﬁcant progress in identifying cheats,
much of their analytics are based on RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary value) models, that preclude
more ﬁner segmentation. Casinos also oﬀer promotions in packages, bundling varying levels of dif-
fering oﬀers into tailored packages. These packages are often oﬀered concurrently with component
promotions. Finding the right match between a consumer and a bundle or component of promotional
options is thus a large-scale combinatorial, mixed bundling problem.

A third complication is that many destination casinos own more than one property, each of which
may run marketing campaigns in parallel. For instance, the MGM group manages 11 casinos in Las
Vegas. In this situation, it is possible that promotions cannibalize demand within the product port-
folio.4 Targeting in this situation has to be co-ordinated such that a consumer is not unproﬁtably
attracted away form a high-margin, high-spend property to a low-margin, low-spend one. Preventing
trading-down of this manner requires understanding consumer preferences not just over promotions,
but over promotion-property combinations, so the targeted promotion incentivizes the focal customer
to self-select into the preferred property from the ﬁrm’s perspective. Further, there is a need to un-
derstand the impact of promotions at the property level due to the need for good demand forecasting.
Lodging and F&B are capacity-constrained resources, and accurate forecasting of the expected visita-
tion and utilization of these resources in response to campaigns is important for eﬀective operational
managing and planning.

Finally, promotion management is not a static problem. Consumers exhibit signiﬁcant state-
dependence and persistence in their visitation and play behavior. Thus, current promotions have long-
lived eﬀects into the future, by aﬀecting the stickiness and proﬁle of repeat business. Incorporating
these dynamic eﬀects of promotions is important to get an accurate picture of the ROI proﬁle from
the promotions, and to allocate them appropriately based on their expected long-run beneﬁt to the
ﬁrm.

4For example, a smart consumer may utilize a corporate lodging promotion to stay at a property in a casino chain,
and spend his entire visit availing of concurrent property-speciﬁc promotions at other properties within the chain, with
no incremental spending realized from the visit to the casino.

7

Current Practice

Some aspects of current practice in targeting has been alluded to above. Many casinos are not
analytically sophisticated in their marketing targeting practice, and employ even more crude, heuristic-
based targeting rules compared to the history-based strategy. Targeting practice at MGM prior to
implementation of the new analytics solution described here was more sophisticated than at many
other casinos, but subject to several of the concerns outlined above. Like many casinos, MGM’s
practice involved use of a speciﬁc form of history-based targeting. To understand the rule, it is useful
to deﬁne a few metrics commonly used in the casino setting.

• Coin-in: is the total dollar outlay by a consumer at a play occasion.
• Hold Percentage: refers to the probability the house wins in a given play. It is interpreted as the
long-run average return for the casino when the consumer plays a dollar in repeated plays. For
example, if a consumer bets $1 at a slot machine, and the casino has programmed the machine
such that it returns $0.8 to the consumer on average, the Coin-in is $1, and the Hold Percentage
is = 20%.

• Theoretical Win or “Theo”:

is widely used in casino mathematics as a measure of how much
money a casino is expected to win from a consumer on a given play. It is deﬁned as Coin-in
× Hold Percentage for the play. It is diﬀerent from the Actual Win, another common metric,
because actual outcomes may be inﬂuenced by random factors like the realization of the play’s
hold. Essentially, how much money a casino can make from a consumer play is a random variable.
The Actual Win is the realization of that random variable, and the Theo is the expected value
of that random variable. For example, if a player plays $100 on Slot Machine A, which has a
hold percentage of 20%, and then later that day plays $100 on Slot Machine B, which has a
hold percentage of 15%, the player’s theoretical win for that day is $100 × .20 + $100 × .15
= $35. Actual win may be diﬀerent from $35 because slot machine A kept $21 (and not the
expected value of $20) for the casino on the consumer’s play there, and slot machine B kept
say $13.5 (and not the expected value of $15) when the consumer played there. Thus, Actual
Win over the day = $21 + $13.5 = $34.5. The Average Daily Theoretical (or ADT) is simply
the average theo over all the individual games played by the consumer over the last N months
of a consumer’s visits, where N varies depending on the casinos ability to store and manage
consumer data. The Average Daily Actual is deﬁned analogously.

MGM, like other casinos, tracks traditional gaming industry metrics like actual win and theoretical
win for its customers. Promotions are allocated based on bins of average theo and actual wins on
the observed trips over the previous N months by the consumer (we cannot reveal the exact value of
N due to business conﬁdentially concerns). In practice, theo and actual wins are highly correlated
across consumers, hence, one can think of this as segmentation on RFM criteria linked to average theo.
More promotions are allocated to those that are observed to have higher realized theo win in the trips
over the last year. Once consumers are scored on the average theo + demographics, a marketing
campaign involving a speciﬁc set of promotions is considered. Those with the highest scores get the
most attractive promotions, those with smaller scores get the less attractive ones, and so forth, where
“attractiveness” of a promotion is assessed based on managerial judgment and knowledge. The bulk
of the promotions are targeted directly to consumers via direct-mail and/or email.

8

Opportunity for Analytics to make an Impact

Analytics can improve the above targeting rule signiﬁcantly. Casinos are a data-rich environment. Due
to large investments in data-warehousing technologies, and due to the wide-spread adoption and use of
loyalty cards, most transactions made by a consumer during a visit to any of the portfolio properties
of MGM are tracked.5 These data can be used to build detailed models of consumer behavior and
consumer response to promotions. These facilitate development of model-based metrics of consumer
value, which can be utilized for subsequent targeting.

Scoring consumers’ value on the basis of their average theo over recently observed trips has several
disadvantages. First, it induces large variability in a given consumer’s value across trips that is driven
by random factors outside the consumer’s control or unrelated to his preferences. The variability
implies valuable consumers may drop in and out of campaigns and are not consistently targeted.
Second, it does not help understand how promotions drive value, for instance, by understanding
whether promotions work by increasing visitation, or by changing the property chosen conditional on
visitation, or by changing spending conditional on property choice and visitation. Understanding these
may be important for formulating and ﬁne-tuning marketing strategy. Third, it does not provide a
forward-looking measure of value that assesses the extent to which a consumer is likely to be proﬁtable
to MGM in the long-run. For instance, a consumer may have wagered little in his ﬁrst visit due to a
trip-speciﬁc reason, but may yet be proﬁtable in the long-run to the casino because his base propensity
to spend at the ﬁrm is high. Conditioning value on a consumer’s recent trip outcomes misses this
component of value. Model-based metrics addresses these disadvantages.

Our model based metric has the advantage that it uses data on observed behavior at all past visits
(and not just the most recent visits) to measure customer value. Hence, it is less variable than recent-
trip metrics. Additionally, for consumers on which very little data exist, the model pools information
from the behavior of similar consumers to provide a less noisy estimate of value compared to using only
recent trip information. It also uses information across the entire range of activities by the consumer to
measure how promotions aﬀect behavior. Moreover, model-based metrics are both history-dependent
(retrospective) and forward-looking (prospective). In the example above of the customer who visited
once but spent little, the model based metric will use the ﬁrst-visit information on the consumer in
conjunction with the observed long-run spending of other similar consumers. Suppose it turns out in
the data that these other consumers spend highly in future visits even though they spent little on their
ﬁrst. The model will then identify the focal consumer in the example as proﬁtable in the long-run
and a viable candidate for targeting, even though his observed ﬁrst-trip spending was low. Finally,
by modeling consumer behavior across the full product-line, models that pool data across properties
enables better assessment and management of cannibalization within the ﬁrm’s product portfolio.

A second area where analytics can make an impact is to improve the match between the consumer
and the promotion bundle. Models estimated on the data predict the expected marginal response
of each consumer type for each combination of oﬀers that make up hypothetical promotion bundles.
Thus, they provide a promotion-bundle−speciﬁc score for each customer.
In parallel, advances in
computing power enable one to search for the optimum bundle for each consumer taking these model-
predicted responses as input. Together, this enables customizing promotions to each customer and

aspects of subsequently play (where, when, how long and how much played), as well as activities (rooms stayed at,
shows watched), and promotions allocated are thus captured in the database.

facilitates development of a scalable, data-driven micro-targeting policy. This is in essence the new
approach implemented at MGM.

In the reminder of the note, we describe the features of this approach, details on the underlying

econometrics, and report on results from its ﬁeld evaluation.

3 Model Framework

The goal of the empirical model is to deliver predictions of the following for consumer i in month t.

1. Whether i will visit one of the MGM casinos in month t. Denote this by the indicator variable

y(1)
i0t.

2. Conditional on visiting, whether i visits property j ∈ (1, .., J). Denote this by the indicator

variable y(1)
ijt .

3. Conditional on visiting, how much will i spend. Denote this by the continuous variable y(2)

it

Collect these in a vector yit =
. Assume that there are Kjt diﬀerent bundles
of marketing promotions oﬀered at property j in month t and let xikjt be an indicator for whether
the kth promotion bundle was oﬀered to consumer i for utilization in property j in month t. A
promotion bundle is a particular combination of oﬀers valid at one or more properties at the casino
(e.g., 2 Tickets to a show + $100 free-play valid only at the Bellagio; or suite upgrade at any of the
MGM properties). Collect the promotional oﬀers valid for property j for month t in a vector (cid:126)xijt =

(cid:1), and collect all the promotion vector across properties for the individual in

(cid:0)xi1jt, .., xikjt, .., xiKjtjt

an array xit = ((cid:126)xi1t, .., (cid:126)xijt, .., (cid:126)xiJt). Let di be a vector containing the observed socio-demographics of
consumer i. Our general model is of the form,

yit = f (xit, di, yit−1, it; , Ωi)

(1)

where, f (.) is a parametrically chosen link function (discussed below), and it is a vector of con-
sumer and month speciﬁc unobservables that are observed by the consumer and incorporated into
his decision making, but unobserved by the econometrician. it generate a likelihood for the data.
Equation (1) allows for state dependence in consumer behavior by allowing current actions to depend
on past outcomes. Equation (1) also allows for heterogeneity in consumer response because the model
parameters, Ωi, are allowed to be consumer speciﬁc. The goal of inference is to use the data to es-
timate the parameters Ωi. The subset of Ωi relating to the direct eﬀect of xit on yit represent the
causal eﬀect of promotions on outcomes, and are key to identifying a set of desirable consumers for
subsequent targeting. The data for estimation includes observations on (yit, xit, di) for a large sample
of consumers (over 1M) over a roughly two year horizon, during which every visit of each i to MGM
is tracked along with every promotion oﬀered.

We now discuss the speciﬁcations we choose for f (.) for estimation.

i0t , and the choice
ijt , as a nested logit model. To operationalize the model, we need to

10

accommodate the fact that the consumer also faces a discrete choice over use of a promotion bundle
conditional on visit at a property.6 The self-selection of consumers into a promotion bundle is in and
of itself informative of types, and we would like to accommodate the information content of these
choices into our estimation procedure. To accommodate this aspect, we specify the lower-most nest of
the discrete-choice model as a choice over use of one (or none) of the oﬀered promotion bundles. The
higher level nests then captures the choice of property, or to not visit. Figure (4) depicts the nesting
structure.

We specify the probability that consumer i chooses bundle k at property j in month t, ikjt, as,

ikjt =

1 +(cid:80)Kjt

exp (ψik)
k=1 exp (ψik)

where, ψi. are bundle-speciﬁc parameters. The probability of visiting property j without using any of

the oﬀered bundles is, 1 −(cid:80)Kjt

as,

k=1 ikjt.

At the second level of the nest, we specify the probability of visiting property j as Pr(y(1)

In the speciﬁcation above, σj ∈ (0, 1) is a property-speciﬁc parameter that captures the eﬀect of
the promotions oﬀered on a consumer’s utility of visiting a property. σj serves as a weight on the
“log-sum” for the lower nest representing the expected utility from utilization of the most preferred
promotion bundle for property a j. g (.) is a function of the past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which we use to allow for state dependence in demand in choices. We specify g (.) to be linear in
main and interaction eﬀects of past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and demographics, and
indexed by property-speciﬁc parameter vector ς (2)
ij . Allowing for g (.) helps improve ﬁt and capture
heterogeneity. Finally, ς (1)
is a property-j speciﬁc intercept. The probability of not visiting any of

3.2 Log-linear Model of Spending

We model spending conditional on visit and property choice as a “Burr” model,

In the above speciﬁcation, h (.) is a function of the current and past Tτ trips made by the consumer
which allows for state dependence in spending. We allow h (.) to be a ﬂexible linear function comprising
of main and interaction eﬀects of current and past visitation behavior, promotion utilization and
demographics, indexed by the parameter vector θi. µ is a saturation parameter that puts an upper
bound on predicted spending. We set µ to be 1.5 × the maximum observed per-trip spending across
consumers. The Burr model above allows expenditure to be positive and bounded and prevents the

model from predicting unreasonably large values of spending in prediction settings. Thus, under this
model, one interprets the observed spending as a ﬂexible fraction of the maximum spend, $µ.

We now collect the set of parameters to be estimated in Ωi ≡ ({ψij, ς (1)

j=1,θi).

4 Estimation

We estimate all the models presented above by maximum likelihood. Before discussing speciﬁc details,
we ﬁrst discuss how we address an endogeneity concern that arises due to the history-dependent nature
of the targeting rule used by MGM under which the data were generated.

4.1 Endogeneity Concern

The concern about endogeneity becomes relevant because we are interested in using the model for
segmenting consumers and not just for prediction. While estimated parameters need not have a causal
interpretation for purely predictive purposes, segmentation requires understanding the causal eﬀect
of promotions for each customer. Unfortunately, because more promotions were targeted in the data
to consumers who play more, a priori we cannot say whether any positive covariation we ﬁnd in
the data between outcomes and promotions is the result of a causal eﬀect of those promotions on
outcomes, or the eﬀect of outcomes on promotion allocation as induced by the targeting rule. This is
the identiﬁcation problem inherent in the analysis. In our setting, we ﬁnd accommodating the eﬀect
of targeting to be critical to avoid overstating the eﬀect of promotions.

Our approach uses a partial (but not perfect) solution to the problem. To understand our approach,

Ti(cid:89)

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

we return to the notation used in Equation (1), where the model is set up in general terms relating
outcomes, yit to (xit, di, yit−1, it). Assume for a moment that promotions xit are randomly allocated
to each agent i. Then, ignoring the initial condition, we can write the likelihood across agents as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi)

fx (xit; φ)

(4)

i=1

t=2

i=1

t=2

where, fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) is the density induced on y by . fx (xit; φ) is the density of xit, and φ are
parameters of that density. The key to note in this situation is that the likelihood factors in x: the
density of x across consumers is not informative about the underlying parameters of interest, Ωi,
because the variation of x across consumers is not conditioned on Ωi. Since the density contribution
of x is not a function of Ωi, it can be ignored when searching for Ωi that maximizes the likelihood of
the data.

On the other hand, when promotions are targeted to consumers based on their behavior, we should

write the likelihood as,

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

N(cid:89)

Ti(cid:89)

i=1

t=2

(cid:2)fyt|yt−1,x,d (yit|yi,t−1, xit, di; Ωi) fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ)(cid:3)

(5)

The likelihood no longer factors because x is set with some knowledge of Ωi (and di). Hence the
variation of x across individuals is also informative about Ωi. For instance, the fact that an individual
is observed to have a high level of marketing targeted to him in the data now tells the model that he
is a “high”-Ωi type. In this situation, we can no longer ignore the likelihood contribution associated
with the density of x. Ignoring that will misspecify the likelihood for Ωi causing a ﬁrst-order bias.
Moreover, not knowing the true density of fx|d (.) also has the potential to cause a bias, arising from a
second-order source of misspeciﬁcation associated with imposing the wrong density. Hence, to recover
Ωi, the likelihood needs to be augmented with the true conditional density of x. This logic is similar
to that in Manchanda, Rossi and Chintagunta’s (2004) analysis.

Our Approach Our approach is facilitated by that fact that we know the exact variables on which
targeting by the casino is based on namely, average Theo and Demographics, and the fact that we
observe these variables in the data. Let zit denote the average Theo of the consumer over his observed
trips to the casino over the previous N months evaluated at the beginning of period t. Let the subset
of demographics used by MGM for targeting be denoted ˜di. Both zit and ˜di are observed in the data.
We know that x depends on Ωi only through

; thus, we can write,

(cid:16)

(cid:17)
fx|d (xit|di; Ωi, φ) = fx|z, ˜d

zit, ˜di

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

xit|zit, ˜di; φ

(6)

Essentially, Equation (6) tells us that we should exploit only the variation in x holding zit, ˜di ﬁxed to
learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Intuitively, as x changes, it produces both a direct eﬀect on
y due to the impact of promotions on outcomes, as well as an indirect eﬀect by changing the set of
individuals targeted. Only the ﬁrst type of variation is useful to measuring the causal eﬀect of x on y
(the second measures the selection induced by targeting). Including the conditional density of x into
the likelihood tells the model that all selection of types that arises from changes in x happen only
through changes in z and ˜d. Hence, any changes in y that is associated with changes in x holding z

13

(cid:16)

(cid:17)

and ˜d ﬁxed, is useful to learn about the direct eﬀect of x on y. Conditioning in this manner helps the
model utilize that variation correctly.

If we knew the density fx|z, ˜d (.) on the right hand side of (6) perfectly, we could plug it into
Equation (5) to address the endogeneity of targeting. A remaining concern arises from the fact that
we do not know fx|z, ˜d (.) perfectly, because the exact targeting function mapping
to x is
not well documented within the company. We know the targeting rule is based on binning zit into
diﬀerent buckets and on combining these buckets with ˜di to construct segments who receive diﬀerent
promotions. However, we do not know the exact cutoﬀs which were used to bin zit. It is also possible
the cutoﬀs varied over time as priorities, personnel and systems changed over the period covered by
the data (though our understanding is the extent of change in the cutoﬀs over the previous two year
period is low). Thus, while the solution above addressees the ﬁrst form of bias, not knowing fx|z, ˜d (.)
perfectly introduces the second form of misspeciﬁcation alluded to above.

zit, ˜di

To address the issue, we adopt an approximate solution. We divide z into discrete bins and form
segments by combining the bins of z and bins of demographics that best approximate the bins used
by MGM for targeting. Formally, letting iz ∈ (1, ..,Iz) denote the bins on the z dimension, and

(cid:1) denote the bins on the demographics dimension, we deﬁne R = Iz ×I ˜d segments corre-

i ˜d ∈(cid:0)1, ..,I ˜d

sponding to each combination of iz and i ˜d. We then estimate a separate model for each such segment
r ∈ (1, .., R), to estimate a segment-speciﬁc parameter vector, Ωr to control for the endogeneity of
targeting.

To understand why the approach works, consider the likelihood incorporating (6),

L ({Ωi} , φ) =

where, Ψ (.) is a ﬂexible function that approximates the density of xit|zit, ˜di. Because the R segments
are deﬁned on the basis of observables, we can a priori assign all observations to one of the R segments.
Consider the subset of Nr consumers who have been assigned a priori to segment r. Then, we can
above with an r−speciﬁc function Ψr (xit), to rewrite the above as a likelihood
replace Ψ

Suppose we run this model only for those observations in segment r. Then, we are back in a situation
analogous to that in Equation (4), because focusing within the segment converts the density contribu-
tion of x into a factor that is independent of Ω(r)
. Since the density contribution of x in Equation (7)
is not a function of Ω(r)
that maximizes the likelihood of the
data for segment r. Thus, we can maximize the likelihood part corresponding to fyt|yt−1,x,d (.) for all
observations within segment r to ﬁnd the segment speciﬁc parameters, Ω(r)
that are not contaminated
by the endogeneity bias.7

7A relevant question here is what explains any observed variation in xit within bin r, if binning has controlled for the
promotion allocation rule. To understand why there could be variation in marketing allocation within bins, note that

14

Thus, to summarize, our method for addressing endogeneity essentially divides observations into
R non-overlapping segments in a ﬁrst step, and then estimates separate models for each sub-segment.
The key is that the segments are based on thresholds that map to the targeting rule (to the extent
possible). The reason we are able to do this is we observe the variables on which targeting is based
on. More generally, behavioral targeting by ﬁrms results in a complicated selection on unobservables
problem in estimation for academics who wish to utilize that data for analysis. Observing the variables
on which targeting is based on converts the problem of selection on unobservables to that of selection
on observables, which facilities controls for nonrandom selection. The method is approximate here
because we do not know the thresholds perfectly. If we know these perfectly, the method would be
exact. In practice, we expect this method to work well because it is simple to implement and exploits
the internal information of ﬁrms which is usually available in such settings. Our method can be
thought of as a generalization to a likelihood-based setting of Hartmann, Nair and Narayanan’s (2011)
Regression Discontinuity based strategy for identifying response under targeting. Both approaches
take advantage of the econometrician’s knowledge of the ﬁrm’s targeting rule. The advantage of this
approach relative to that strategy is our approach utilizes the variation across all consumers within
a bin for inference, and is therefore more eﬃcient than the Regression Discontinuity approach, which
bases inference on the behavior of only marginal consumers who fall on the edges of targeting bins.

5 Data and Model Operationalization

Prior to operationalizing the model, we spent a signiﬁcant amount of time and eﬀort on cleaning and
scrubbing data to produce a data set ﬁt for estimation. Much of the eﬀort was spent on three aspects,
namely, (1) collating diﬀerent sources of information from disparate units within the company into one
central repository (e.g., collating the promotions targeted by the diﬀerent properties in a particular
month together to construct the complete set of promotion options available to every consumer in
every month in the data); (2) matching the diﬀerent sources of information based on unique identiﬁers
(e.g., matching consumer id-s in the transaction database to consumer id-s in the marketing databases
of corporate and property-speciﬁc departments); (3) cleaning the data to eliminate database coding
errors, unreasonable entries and/or missing information.8

Data Descriptives

As mentioned above, the data consist of individual-level transactions of a random sample of about
1M consumers picked from MGM’s prospect database. Very high-value consumers, who are typically
assigned individual hosts and are marketed to separately are not included in this project. Of the
consumers in the sample, some are targeted marketing oﬀers, some not. Visitation and transactions
of all consumers are observed, so are details of all the oﬀers mailed out and redeemed. Most mass-

the binning rule only makes a consumer eligible for a particular bundle of promotions. Whether a consumer actually
receives the promotional bundle in the mail is essentially random. In several situations, the ﬁrm chooses to allocate
only a random subset of agents within each bin its promotional bundle because it faces margin or cost constraints that
prevent it from blanketing everyone in the segment with the bundle. It is also the case that diﬀerent properties face
diﬀerent margin or cost constraints based on their priorities and competitive situation, and this generates variation
in the number of consumers picked within each bin. Both sources of within-segment variation in promotions are not
correlated with consumer tastes, and do not cause a bias in estimation.

8The 11 MGM properties in Las Vegas which are spanned by the data are: Aria, Bellagio, Circus-Circus, Excalibur,

Luxor, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Mirage, Monte Carlo, New York-New York and Railroad Pass.

15

volume consumers oﬀers are targeted via email or direct-mail. Consumer exposure to print, online
and billboard advertising and other media are not included in the data. Hence, some eﬀects of
marketing are not captured in our results. However, these forms of missing advertising were not
targeted, and hence the “missingness” of the omitted advertising variables in our individual-level
models is not consumer speciﬁc. To the extent possible, we believe we have captured almost all
targeted promotions available to the consumers that are speciﬁc to MGM. We believe we have also
captured most of the transactions that occur during a consumer visit. Some transaction information
is missing if the consumer uses cash or if he does not have a loyalty card number from MGM. But we
believe this proportion is small. Transaction information at other casinos outside the MGM family
and competitive promotions are not tracked. However, this limitation is shared by all ﬁrms in the
industry and is a constraint the analytics solution needs to take as given. Developing a database with
a 360 degree view of consumer behavior across competing casinos will be an important step forward
for the industry as a whole in order to capture competition and “share-of-wallet” better.

Model Operationalization and Details of Variables

Below, we brieﬂy discuss some details of how we operationalized the models in the context of our
application.

Segments: We divided observations into R = 50+ segments prior to estimation (we do not reveal
the exact value of R due to business conﬁdentially concerns).. These segments were based on bins
of Theo, consumer distance from the casino (Local, Regional, National or International), the number
of past trips made by the customer prior to the beginning of the data, and whether the consumer
primarily played at slots or tables.9

Demographics (di): Within each segment, a rich set of demographics (corresponding to di)
are included in all the estimated models, including age, MGM-speciﬁc tier, tenure on books, whether
player has a host at MGM (if pertinent), favorite game.
In addition, we map in census-level zip
code demographic information for each individual into the data including mean household income,
disposable income, and mean household expenditure on airfare, entertainment, food & beverage, and
lodging.

Past History {g (.) and h (.)}: To operationalize the functions g (.) and h (.) capturing the
history of past play, we include several metrics of past history including average bet, coin-in to point
ratios, jackpot incidence, number of games played, number of sessions played and time spent. We
also include rich functions of past Theo and Actual Win including Theo and Actual Win at tables
and slots separately, in residential casinos versus non-residential casinos, in luxury versus non-luxury
properties (based on MGM’s deﬁnitions of property classiﬁcations); Theo and Actual Win arising from
free play-based play, and other metrics of dollars of incented vs. non-incented play.

Marketing Oﬀers: We include variables measuring the entire range of marketing oﬀers from
the company at both the corporate (valid at all properties) and the property-level. These oﬀers are

9Tables are more subject to pit-boss eﬀects than slots; hence, incorporating this distinction helps tap into the

underlying consumer type better.

extensive and include:

1. Room metrics like room type, room discount, number of comp nights, whether comp is midweek

or weekend.

2. Entertainment, sports and facility oﬀer metrics like club pool oﬀer, entertainment type, indicator
for entertainment oﬀer, ticket price discount, indicator for facility oﬀers, indicator for sports
oﬀers, sports oﬀer amounts, sports ticket price discounts, indicator for golf oﬀer.

3. Casino Event Information metrics like indicator for inclusion in the casino event prize pool, the
prize pool format, indicator for grand prize inclusion, grand prize format, prize value oﬀered,
cost of event for which oﬀer is made, buy-in amount, points to entry if oﬀered, tier credits to
entry if oﬀered.

4. Special Event metrics like indicators for special event, tier upgrade oﬀers, tier credits oﬀered,
oﬀers of points that count toward higher tiers in the MGM loyalty program, comps linked to
points, point multiplier oﬀers, and multipliers on points that count toward higher tiers (oﬀered
on visits that overlap with birthdays).

5. Retail and spa oﬀer metrics like indicator for a retail oﬀer, retail oﬀer amount, indicator for spa

oﬀer, and spa service amount.

6. Air and limo oﬀer metrics like indicator for an airline oﬀer, air package amount, indicator for

limo oﬀer, indicator for VIP check-in ﬂag.

7. Free-play and Promo-chip oﬀer metrics like free-play oﬀer amount and promo-chip oﬀer amount.

8. Resort Credit metrics like resort credit type and resort credit amount.

9. F&B metrics like F&B oﬀer and F&B oﬀer amount.

10. Other metrics like whether the customer started oﬀ his ﬁrst visit as a result of a database oﬀer,

and net reinvestment amount on the consumer.

Table (1) shows the R segment deﬁnitions, as well as the proportion of consumers and the number
of trips observed in each bin. For conﬁdentiality reasons, an undisclosed, random number of bins are
omitted from the table (so the percentages will not add up to 1). Overall, in several of our models, we
include over 200+ variables. Estimation of all models described above was programmed in the SAS
statistical package.

6 Results

We present a representative set of results for brevity. We present parameter estimates and not marginal
eﬀects for business conﬁdentiality reasons. The ﬁnal implementation involves over 120 separate esti-
mated models of consumer behavior (separated by segment, casino and outcomes), over 180+ variables
in each model, and about 20,000 parameters estimated across these models. Figure (5) documents
the eﬀect of the time since the last trip on visit propensity. We operationalize the eﬀect of time since
the last trip in the various models by categorizing it into discrete buckets, and including a dummy
variable for each time-interval bucket. To summarize a large number of estimates in a meaningful
way, we present the distribution across the R segments of each such dummy variable as estimated
from the data. Figure (5) presents these distributions. Looking at Figure (5), we see strong evidence
of duration dependence in the data. The hazard of visitation is in general declining in the time since
the last visit: those than visited 15-90 days (pink distribution) are on average roughly 6 more likely
to visit than those who have visited more than 391-690 ago (lime green distribution). This may also
reﬂect within segment heterogeneity in that the ﬁrst bucket comprise consumers with high utility
from gambling and visitation, while the second reﬂect those with lower value (or costs) from visits.
These duration eﬀects allow the model to link a customers’ visitation behavior over time in assessing
his relative value to the casino. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, we cannot report how these
numbers or the ones below translate into visit propensities at each of the individual properties or into
proﬁtability or revenue.

Figure (6) presents the eﬀect of the money won on the previous trip on current visitation propensity.
We include the money won on the previous trip as a continuous variable in all models. Figure (6)

19

Figure 5: Eﬀect of Time Since Last Trip on Visit Propensity

plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across the R segments. Figure (6) documents
interesting heterogeneity of past winnings on current visitation: there is a bi-modal distribution of
eﬀects, with a smaller segment for whom past winnings seem to matter signiﬁcantly in driving future
visits. This group may form a viable segment for targeting free-play promotions, for instance. Figure
(7) documents the eﬀect of the distance from the consumer’s residence to Las Vegas on visit propensity.
We operationalize this as a continuous variable that varies across consumers included in each segment
(note that even though we create segments based on distance, we still have variation in distance across
consumers within each segment). Figure (7) plots a histogram of the coeﬃcient on this variable across
the the R segments. Interestingly, we ﬁnd the eﬀect of distance is not uniform: for some segments,
especially those within the “Regional” and “Local” distance segments, living further away increases
visit propensity, perhaps capturing satiation with gambling opportunities or the characteristics of
suburban gamblers.

We now discuss some results on the eﬀect of targeted marketing. As a representative example,
we plot the eﬀect of providing a free room on visitation. We estimate a separate eﬀect of a free
room promotion at each casino and for each of the R segments. We operationalize these eﬀects by
interacting a free-room dummy, with a dummy for which casino the free-room can be availed at,
and including these interaction variables in the model of visitation for each of the R segments. In
Figure (8) we plot the estimated eﬀect of providing a free room at a given casino relative to providing
a room at one of the casino properties, called property X. Each box-plot presents the distribution
of that casino’s eﬀect relative to property X plotted across the R segments. For example, the box-
plot on the extreme left of Figure (8) named “A” shows the distribution across the R segments of

the eﬀect of providing a free room at property A relative to that at property X. Interestingly, the
eﬀects are all positive, implying that providing a free room at each of the listed casinos has a higher
eﬀect on visitation relative to providing one at property X, suggesting that free-room provision at
property X produces little marginal visitation relative to the others. By allowing for heterogeneous
property-speciﬁc promotions in this manner, the model helps assess the property-promotion-customer
match better, so as to result in better optimization of promotions across customers and properties in
a subsequent stage.

Finally, we also present plots of the eﬀect of customer characteristics on spending conditional
on visit. Figures (9a) and (9b) present the eﬀect of customer age and gender on spending. To
operationalize customer age and gender in our spending model, we create dummy variables for various
age buckets, interact these with gender (Male/Female dummy), and include these interacted dummy
variables in models of spending for each of the R segments. This produces ﬂexible speciﬁcations of
demographic eﬀects. In the left panel in Figure (9a) we plot the eﬀect of customer age on spending
relative to that of the “less than 25 years” bucket for Males. Each box-plot presents the distribution
for males across the R segments of being in that age bucket relative to customers who are less than
25 years old. For example, the box-plot on the extreme left of Figure (9a) shows the distribution
across the R segments of the eﬀect of being a male aged 25-35 relative to a male aged <25 yrs. on
spending propensity. Figure (9b) shows the analogous plot for females. Interestingly, we see little
systematic diﬀerences in spending all things held equal, across various age tiers for males. However,
the distribution is inverted U-shaped for females: women aged 25-35 are signiﬁcantly less likely to
spend compared to those below 25 years; older women are more likely to spend; while spending drops
to the base level for the oldest bucket. These demographic diﬀerences in spending captured by the
model are utilized in improving the match between promotions and customers in the subsequent
optimization steps.

We presented only a ﬂavor of the results given space and conﬁdentiality considerations. The main

point is that at the end of this process, we have at our disposal a set of empirical models that predict a
person, property and trip speciﬁc promotional-lift for each available promotion or promotion bundle.
These predictions form inputs into the second module of the analytics solution, as discussed below.

7 Optimization

The second module involves an optimization platform that searches within a speciﬁed promotion set to
ﬁnd the right promotion bundle for each consumer in the database. The optimization is implemented
at the campaign-level and is operationalized in the following manner. First, managers decide on the
goal of an advertising campaign (e.g., drive visitation at a new property, increase play at slots etc.).
Based on the goals of the campaign, the ﬁrm decides on a set of component promotional options
that could potentially be oﬀered to the customer base (e.g., a given level of discount at the new
property or a given level of free-play credits). Taking these components as given, each customer is
scored on each possible component or bundle of component promotions. The scoring is based on the
models of visitation and spending outlined above. The score captures the expected proﬁtability of the
customer if given the promotion option, by computing expected spending (unconditional on a visit),
and subtracting out the expected cost to the ﬁrm of oﬀering that promotion bundle to the customer.
At the end of the scoring step, we have for each customer a recommended promotion bundle that yields
the highest expected proﬁts. In some situations, the optimization may be constrained by additional
decision rules desired by management. For example, management may impose a decision rule of not
oﬀering more than two promotional components in a bundle for consumers of a particular type; or
alternatively, impose a minimum margin the promotion has to meet in order for a customer to be
eligible. Figure (10) depicts the process developed for optimization.

ability to scale rapidly to scoring large numbers of consumers. For instance, a speciﬁc campaign we
consider in the next section involves scoring about 2M consumers on close for 50+ promotional options.
The optimization package should also integrate well with the statistical models presented above, and
provide managers to ability to add constraints to the optimization in a user-friendly manner. We
implemented these on Teradata c(cid:13), a commercial database platform that is developed for Big Data
analytics applications.

On the optimization front, the main gain is the ability to customize promotions to each individual
consumer. Prior to our engagement, promotions were assigned at the segment-level. The new system
enabled optimizing promotions to the individual consumer-level, facilitating ﬁner micro-targeting.
Further, compared to the prior system, the number of bundles that could be considered increased
by about 6X, increasing the number of instruments available to improve promotion eﬃciency. With
additional hardware space and time, it is straightforward to scale up the system to accommodate even
larger bundle sets.

Finally, dashboard applications were also developed that enabled managers to monitor and dissect
company performance on their desktops. Figure (11) provides an example. These dashboards were
linked to the underlying statistical model and optimization packages, so as to embed the framework
in a user-friendly decision support system.

This completes the discussion of the model framework and development eﬀort.

8 Results from a Randomized Evaluation

The models developed above are assessed as part of a large-scale randomized test at MGM. We imple-
ment the test as part of the Summer 2012 corporate campaign. The test evaluates the performance
of the model in selecting consumers to whom a set of promotion bundles could be targeted, as well as
the ability of the model to match consumers to one of these promotion bundles.

The test involves about 2M customers, picked from MGM’s prospect database. The goal of the test
is to compare the eﬃcacy of the model in promotional targeting relative to the status quo approach
used at the ﬁrm. The test is implemented as follows. First, a pilot test was conducted in Spring 2012
with a limited number of promotional oﬀerings to assess test design, understand ball-park customer
response and to understand logistics of implementation. Based on this, the 2M consumers in the
prospect data are randomly divided into 3 groups prior to the beginning of summer. Group 1 con-
sumers (30% of the total) are scored on the model we develop. Group 2 (30% of the total) consumers
are scored based on the status-quo approach (Theo on last visit and demographics). Group 3 con-
sumers (10% of the total) are treated as the control – they do not receive any of the corporate oﬀers.
The remaining 30% of consumers are tested on auxiliary aspects that are unrelated to the model, and
are not relevant to this evaluation. Managers then created 75+ promotion bundles which comprise
the set of possible promotions that could be oﬀered to consumers in the campaign. Each consumer
could be oﬀered only one bundle during the campaign. Once scoring is completed for groups 1 and 2,
assignment of these promotion bundles is implemented in the following way. In group 1, each customer
is assigned the promotion bundle that provides the highest proﬁtability subject to making a minimum
threshold margin. The margin is set outside the model by management. If the expected proﬁtability
of the best oﬀer does not meet the margin threshold, no corporate promotion is sent to that consumer.

In group 2, consumers are sorted into segments as per the status quo method. Managers then assign
a segment-speciﬁc promotion bundle to each segment in the group in the same way as they have made
those decisions in the past. All corporate oﬀers are then emailed to consumers. The oﬀers are valid
for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012. All visits to any of the MGM properties along with
all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers are then tracked during the July 31 − Oct 31
window during which the promotion is active. No other corporate marketing was targeted at these
consumers at that time.

During the same period, the three groups are also exposed to non-corporate campaigns set in-
dependently by the MGM resorts’ individual property marketing teams. Thus, those in the control
and treatment groups receive other property-speciﬁc promotion oﬀers over and above those associated
with the corporate test. Hence, the performance of groups 1 and 2 relative to the control should
be interpreted as the net eﬀect of the corporate campaign relative to the existing property-speciﬁc
marketing activity. The promotions for the individual properties are mailed out in the Summer prior
to July, and are set independent of the corporate campaign; so they are not jointly allocated or adjust
in respond to the corporate level interventions in the test and control groups.10 These aspects of
the test-design derives from organizational considerations within the ﬁrm − organizationally, it was
not feasible to stop all property-speciﬁc promotional activity during the test period. Therefore, we
believe the test provides a lower bound on the performance of the new methods within the ﬁrm as a
whole, because further gains to what is assessed in the test can be had if property-speciﬁc campaigns
are also coordinated with the corporate campaign. Further, to the extent the new method is better,
implementing it at the individual properties as well would be the source of additional gains from the
adoption of the new analytics solution. Figure (12) presents the test design pictorially.

Table (2) reports the results. For business conﬁdentiality reasons, all dollar numbers in Table (2)
have been scaled by an undisclosed constant; so these should be interpreted as scaled dollars. When
we refer to revenues or costs below, we refer to these in scaled dollars, which we call units of “R$”
for brevity. Column 1 of Table (2) report on the results for Group 1, column 2 for Group 2 and the
last for the control. The top row of the table reports “adjusted” revenues for each group. These are
constructed by summing all gaming and non-gaming Theo from agents in a group that visited during
the July 31 − Oct 31 window, and subtracting out any Freeplay dollars used as well as the dollar
value of any MGM-speciﬁc reward points redeemed during that period. The company does not count
freeplay and reward point redemption as sources of real revenue, and considers this as the right metric
for assessing policy. Note this makes the adjusted revenues a more conservative metric of the gains
from a campaign. The next row reports the costs of the campaign across the three groups. These are
calculated as the net dollar value of promotions oﬀered. Other costs of running the campaign (e.g.,
printing direct mail) are not included. The costs row for groups 1 and 2 refer to the costs incurred
by the corporate team to run the campaign. The cost entry for the control group refer to the costs
incurred by the properties to run the other campaigns they conducted in parallel to the focal corporate
promotion.

Looking at Table (2), we see that net adjusted revenues from those who received the corporate

10Individual-properties also employ on-the-ﬂoor promotions like free-drinks allocated to playing patrons, that may
adjust to the consumer play behavior induced by our interventions. While we do not rule this kind of promotion
adjustment at the individual-property level, we believe the impact of these on our results is very small, as these kinds of
activities account for less than 5% of promotional spending by the properties. The bulk of property speciﬁc promotions
are mailed out and are pre-determined during the intervention period.

Figure 12: Test Design

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the design of the test conducted to evaluate the proposed model. Group A consumers were oﬀered

corporate promotions based on the model; Group B based on the status quo method; Group C (Control) consumers were

oﬀered no corporate promotions. All groups continued to receive promotions oﬀered by individual properties. The oﬀers are
valid for redemption from July 31 to October 31, 2012 and are mailed out in Summer 2012. All visits to any of the MGM
properties align with all transactions involving any of the 2M consumers in the test are then tracked during the July 31 −

Oct 31 window during which the promotion is active.

under the new model. Thus, adjusted revenues are higher under the new policy. We see net costs to
the corporate group are about R$41.42M under the new policy versus R$43.90M under the status-quo.
The upshot of the revenue and cost implications is about R$72.64M proﬁt to the casino under the new
policy compared to about R$68.07M under the status-quo. The diﬀerence is about R$4.57M for this
campaign. Even though we cannot disclose how much this is in real dollars, we are able to disclose a
range − in real dollars, this incremental diﬀerence is between $1 and $5M incremental proﬁt for the
ﬁrm.

The comparison to the control group is also informative about the relative proﬁtability of the new
method compared to the campaign strategies of the individual properties. Looking at the third column
in Table (2), we see that the various other campaigns run concurrently by the individual properties
brought in about R$36.8M of revenue from consumers in the control group. Recall that the control
is 1/3
rd the size of groups 1 and 2; so to obtain a relative comparison, we should multiply the dollars
in the control by 3. Computing scaled revenues 3×R$36.8M = R$110.4M, we see the new method
is superior in terms of revenues to the aggregated impact of the individual property campaigns as
well, bringing in about R$3.7M more (R$114.1M for the new policy vs. R$110.4M for the control).
Computing costs, the individual properties spent a scaled total of 3×R$14.5M = R$43.5M. The net
proﬁt impact is 3×R$22.2M = R$66.6M, which is less than the R$72.6M proﬁt associated with the
new policy. Note these comparisons are at the aggregate level, comparing the new method to the sum
total of the eﬀect across all 12 properties, and not a comparison of any one property’s method.

Computing a Return on Investment per dollar spent, we ﬁnd the new policy provides a net ROI
of about 2.75 compared to 2.53 for the individual properties, and 2.55 for the status-quo approach.
Thus, a dollar spent in promotions generates about 20 cents more incremental spending under the new
policy compared to the current practice at the ﬁrm. As another metric, if the 4 campaigns in one year
each spent the same amount on promotions as the Summer campaign, at these levels of ROI, the ﬁrm
would make about R$33.6M (or between $10M and $15M in real dollars) in incremental proﬁt from
using the new model compared to the status-quo method, or about R$41.7M (or between $14M and
$19M in real dollars) in incremental revenues compared to the aggregation of the campaign planning
strategies of the individual properties.

9 Conclusions

Eﬀorts on developing and implementing a comprehensive marketing analytics solution for a real-world
company is presented. The framework leverages the richness of the company’s data to develop detailed
models of consumer behavior for use for optimized targeting. The models feature themes emphasized
in the academic marketing science literature, including incorporation of consumer heterogeneity and
state-dependence into utility, and the development of new methods for controlling for the endogene-
ity of the ﬁrm’s historical targeting rule in estimation. The issues discussed are relevant for other
customer-facing ﬁrms operating in data-rich environments that wish to improve their promotion tar-
geting and management using modern quantitative methods. The models are then assessed relative
to the status-quo using a large-scale ﬁeld intervention that shows the proﬁts from adopting the new
system are substantial. We believe the scale of model development and implementation and the com-
bination of the econometrics with a ﬁeld intervention in the context of a real-world ﬁrm are novel to

the marketing science literature.

For academics wishing to port marketing science models from theory to practice, our experience
in model building holds a few lessons. First, heterogeneity in consumer behavior is extensive. A large
number of segments are required to capture the amount of heterogeneity seen in the data. Even with
R = 50+ segments, we could detect signiﬁcant amount of within-segment heterogeneity, some of which
we do not model simply on account of practical diﬃculties, and for ease of model implementation and
simplicity in use and exposition. We try to capture much of this by including functions of past behavior
into the model (along with demographics).

Second, even with this extensive segmentation, we have a large number of observations in each
bucket, a luxury aﬀorded by the Big Data revolution of recent years. Because of this, we found we are
able to estimate most of our eﬀects fairly precisely and that issues of sampling error associated with
data sparsity, often a signiﬁcant issue in academic work, are not at the forefront in this setting. Rather,
practical signiﬁcance and not statistical signiﬁcance becomes the salient issue in model selection.

Third, ﬁtting the data well often requires inclusion of variables numbering in the hundreds. More
generally, the advent of database marketing, the integration of marketing with technology, and the
proliferation of instruments by which to incentivize and reach consumers imply that a large number of
marketing metrics are now tracked at ﬁrms. Incorporating these into econometric models while allow-
ing for ﬂexible speciﬁcations that include main and interaction eﬀects imply systems with hundreds
of variables. Thus, software that can manage the scale of both data and the variable set become key.
Also key are statistical methods that scale well. For instance, maximizing a likelihood over a large
set of parameters with a large number of observations becomes quickly problematic if the objective
functions are not smooth and the likelihood is not concave. Hence, in such situations, models like
the logit that have well deﬁned, smooth and concave objective functions, and scale well in variables,
become vey attractive.

Fourth, we ﬁnd that thinking structurally about the data generating process is very important in
assessing the historical variation in the data and in using it to formulate policy. In our setting, we
found that accommodating the ﬁrm’s historical targeting rule in inference was critical to measuring
the right eﬀect of promotions, and for guarding against recommending a signiﬁcant ramping up of
promotions when using the estimated parameters for formulating marketing policy.

Fifth, in many large organizations, getting an analytics project oﬀ the ground involves a signiﬁcant
ﬁxed cost associated with data collation and cleaning. It is typical that data are spread across various
units within the organization, that some parts of the data are “dirty” or missing, and that some data
are available only in unstructured or non-digital form. Thus an academic or consulting company
engaging in an analytics eﬀort with the organization should expect to invest a signiﬁcant amount of
upfront time and eﬀort in data cleaning and scrubbing. In our view, this component of the engagement
is of critical importance, and reaps large investments because the value of the subsequent modeling is
driven to a great degree by the richness and quality of data inputs.
