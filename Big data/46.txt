Abstract

Comparisons of wage rates across countries have become key ingredients in
evaluating theories of international trade, the role of trade in exacerbating
wage inequality, and the role of capitalist reforms  in economic  transition.
Despite  the  importance  of  cross-country  wage  comparisons,  it  is  widely
agreed  that  no  credible,  comparable  wage  estimates  exist.  This  paper
suggests  a  simple  procedure  for  comparing  the  average  wage  rate  of
workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in
McDonald’s  restaurants  in  27  countries  that  are  at  dramatically  different
stages of economic development. Real wage rates are computed at current
exchange  rates,  and  also  after  adjustment  for  purchasing  power  parity  in
units  of  (cid:147)Big  Macs(cid:148)  per  hour.  The  results  indicate  that  real  wages  for
identical jobs in the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe are some four to five
times  higher  than  in  Eastern  Europe,  Korea,  or  Brazil,  and  an  order  of
magnitude higher than in China, India, or Colombia.

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide
simple, easily collected, and credible measures of real wage rates that may be compared across
widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-

reflect productivity differences.  Work by Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997) attempts to tailor

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in

stages of economic development. Real wage rates are computed at current
exchange  rates,  and  also  after  adjustment  for  purchasing  power  parity  in
units  of  (cid:147)Big  Macs(cid:148)  per  hour.  The  results  indicate  that  real  wages  for

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide

widely varied economic circumstances.

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-

which provides new computations of poverty rates before and after economic reforms, and which has become a major
source of discussions of the desirability of further reforms.
2 Trefler (1993), like the much earlier work of Krueger (1968), uses the assumption that measured wage differences
reflect productivity differences.  Work by Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997) attempts to tailor
assumptions  to the likely presence or absence of factor price equalization.

relationship between trade and wage inequality and references to the huge literature on the latter.  Leamer (1997)
provides a somewhat different view.

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

5

draw strong conclusions.  Nevertheless, as these data stand they indicate that adjustments to the
Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek model of trade flows that are derived by assuming that wage rates reflect
workers of different (cid:147)quality(cid:148) will have a hard time explaining our findings.

Interpretation and Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a simple, credible measure of wage rates for identical jobs in
countries that are at very different stages of development. These wage measures indicate that
similar work is compensated at dramatically different rates, whether measured in US dollars at
current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity using the price of the Big Macs that
these workers produce.

These results imply three key conclusions. First, it is apparent that there are considerable

differences in living standards for workers performing essentially identical tasks in different
countries. These large differences in living standards across countries appear to have little or
nothing to do with differences in the skills of these workers or in the non-pecuniary characteristics
of the jobs these workers hold. This suggests that models of economic development in which
organizational and structural differences account for differences in income levels are of
considerable importance.

Second, as Figure 1 indicates, it is also apparent that within some country groups, such as
Western Europe, the USA, and Japan, there is a striking similarity in wage rates whether measured
in a common currency or with  purchasing-power adjustments. This suggests that models of trade
flows that assume factor-price-equalization among these countries may well be empirically
successful, but that other assumptions will be required in tests that are more expansive.  These
results also suggest that there is little reason to expect substantial mobility across the borders of
these countries, but more reason to expect mobility from other parts of Europe into these countries
should this become feasible.

Finally, in future research it would be useful to collect similar data on wage rates for

standardized occupations over time. Among other things, this would begin to provide the factual
basis to appraise economic reforms being undertaken in both the transitional and developing
countries.  We believe that our own research demonstrates that this is a feasible task and that it
could be carried out with a modicum of resources.

Abstract

Comparisons of wage rates across countries have become key ingredients in
evaluating theories of international trade, the role of trade in exacerbating
wage inequality, and the role of capitalist reforms  in economic  transition.
Despite  the  importance  of  cross-country  wage  comparisons,  it  is  widely
agreed  that  no  credible,  comparable  wage  estimates  exist.  This  paper
suggests  a  simple  procedure  for  comparing  the  average  wage  rate  of
workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in
McDonald’s  restaurants  in  27  countries  that  are  at  dramatically  different
stages of economic development. Real wage rates are computed at current
exchange  rates,  and  also  after  adjustment  for  purchasing  power  parity  in
units  of  (cid:147)Big  Macs(cid:148)  per  hour.  The  results  indicate  that  real  wages  for
identical jobs in the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe are some four to five
times  higher  than  in  Eastern  Europe,  Korea,  or  Brazil,  and  an  order  of
magnitude higher than in China, India, or Colombia.

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide
simple, easily collected, and credible measures of real wage rates that may be compared across
widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

5

draw strong conclusions.  Nevertheless, as these data stand they indicate that adjustments to the
Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek model of trade flows that are derived by assuming that wage rates reflect
workers of different (cid:147)quality(cid:148) will have a hard time explaining our findings.

Interpretation and Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a simple, credible measure of wage rates for identical jobs in
countries that are at very different stages of development. These wage measures indicate that
similar work is compensated at dramatically different rates, whether measured in US dollars at
current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity using the price of the Big Macs that
these workers produce.

These results imply three key conclusions. First, it is apparent that there are considerable

differences in living standards for workers performing essentially identical tasks in different
countries. These large differences in living standards across countries appear to have little or
nothing to do with differences in the skills of these workers or in the non-pecuniary characteristics
of the jobs these workers hold. This suggests that models of economic development in which
organizational and structural differences account for differences in income levels are of
considerable importance.

Second, as Figure 1 indicates, it is also apparent that within some country groups, such as
Western Europe, the USA, and Japan, there is a striking similarity in wage rates whether measured
in a common currency or with  purchasing-power adjustments. This suggests that models of trade
flows that assume factor-price-equalization among these countries may well be empirically
successful, but that other assumptions will be required in tests that are more expansive.  These
results also suggest that there is little reason to expect substantial mobility across the borders of
these countries, but more reason to expect mobility from other parts of Europe into these countries
should this become feasible.

Finally, in future research it would be useful to collect similar data on wage rates for

standardized occupations over time. Among other things, this would begin to provide the factual
basis to appraise economic reforms being undertaken in both the transitional and developing
countries.  We believe that our own research demonstrates that this is a feasible task and that it
could be carried out with a modicum of resources.

Abstract

Comparisons of wage rates across countries have become key ingredients in
evaluating theories of international trade, the role of trade in exacerbating
wage inequality, and the role of capitalist reforms  in economic  transition.
Despite  the  importance  of  cross-country  wage  comparisons,  it  is  widely
agreed  that  no  credible,  comparable  wage  estimates  exist.  This  paper
suggests  a  simple  procedure  for  comparing  the  average  wage  rate  of
workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in
McDonald’s  restaurants  in  27  countries  that  are  at  dramatically  different
stages of economic development. Real wage rates are computed at current
exchange  rates,  and  also  after  adjustment  for  purchasing  power  parity  in
units  of  (cid:147)Big  Macs(cid:148)  per  hour.  The  results  indicate  that  real  wages  for
identical jobs in the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe are some four to five
times  higher  than  in  Eastern  Europe,  Korea,  or  Brazil,  and  an  order  of
magnitude higher than in China, India, or Colombia.

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide
simple, easily collected, and credible measures of real wage rates that may be compared across
widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-
                                                          
1 See, for example, Deaton and Terraza (2000), which has been widely discussed in the popular press of India, and
which provides new computations of poverty rates before and after economic reforms, and which has become a major
source of discussions of the desirability of further reforms.
2 Trefler (1993), like the much earlier work of Krueger (1968), uses the assumption that measured wage differences
reflect productivity differences.  Work by Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997) attempts to tailor
assumptions  to the likely presence or absence of factor price equalization.
3 Mokhtari and Rassekh (1989) provide a survey of earlier direct empirical tests and evidence favorable to FPE among
the OECD countries.  O(cid:146)Rourke and Williamson (1996) study the historical record,  while more recent indirect tests are
contained in Hanson and Slaughter (1999) and Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2001)
4 Johnson and Stafford (1999) provide a detailed review of the theoretical and empirical issues associated with the
relationship between trade and wage inequality and references to the huge literature on the latter.  Leamer (1997)
provides a somewhat different view.
5 Freeman and Oostendorp (2000) provide a detailed discussion of the enormous difficulty of comparing the available
international wage data. Deaton (2001) provides a general discussion of similar issues in the measurement of poverty.

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

5

draw strong conclusions.  Nevertheless, as these data stand they indicate that adjustments to the
Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek model of trade flows that are derived by assuming that wage rates reflect
workers of different (cid:147)quality(cid:148) will have a hard time explaining our findings.

Interpretation and Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a simple, credible measure of wage rates for identical jobs in
countries that are at very different stages of development. These wage measures indicate that
similar work is compensated at dramatically different rates, whether measured in US dollars at
current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity using the price of the Big Macs that
these workers produce.

These results imply three key conclusions. First, it is apparent that there are considerable

differences in living standards for workers performing essentially identical tasks in different
countries. These large differences in living standards across countries appear to have little or
nothing to do with differences in the skills of these workers or in the non-pecuniary characteristics
of the jobs these workers hold. This suggests that models of economic development in which
organizational and structural differences account for differences in income levels are of
considerable importance.

Second, as Figure 1 indicates, it is also apparent that within some country groups, such as
Western Europe, the USA, and Japan, there is a striking similarity in wage rates whether measured
in a common currency or with  purchasing-power adjustments. This suggests that models of trade
flows that assume factor-price-equalization among these countries may well be empirically
successful, but that other assumptions will be required in tests that are more expansive.  These
results also suggest that there is little reason to expect substantial mobility across the borders of
these countries, but more reason to expect mobility from other parts of Europe into these countries
should this become feasible.

Finally, in future research it would be useful to collect similar data on wage rates for

standardized occupations over time. Among other things, this would begin to provide the factual
basis to appraise economic reforms being undertaken in both the transitional and developing
countries.  We believe that our own research demonstrates that this is a feasible task and that it
could be carried out with a modicum of resources.

Abstract

Comparisons of wage rates across countries have become key ingredients in
evaluating theories of international trade, the role of trade in exacerbating
wage inequality, and the role of capitalist reforms  in economic  transition.
Despite  the  importance  of  cross-country  wage  comparisons,  it  is  widely
agreed  that  no  credible,  comparable  wage  estimates  exist.  This  paper
suggests  a  simple  procedure  for  comparing  the  average  wage  rate  of
workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in
McDonald’s  restaurants  in  27  countries  that  are  at  dramatically  different

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide
simple, easily collected, and credible measures of real wage rates that may be compared across
widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-
                                                          
1 See, for example, Deaton and Terraza (2000), which has been widely discussed in the popular press of India, and
which provides new computations of poverty rates before and after economic reforms, and which has become a major
source of discussions of the desirability of further reforms.
2 Trefler (1993), like the much earlier work of Krueger (1968), uses the assumption that measured wage differences
reflect productivity differences.  Work by Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997) attempts to tailor
assumptions  to the likely presence or absence of factor price equalization.
3 Mokhtari and Rassekh (1989) provide a survey of earlier direct empirical tests and evidence favorable to FPE among
the OECD countries.  O(cid:146)Rourke and Williamson (1996) study the historical record,  while more recent indirect tests are
contained in Hanson and Slaughter (1999) and Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2001)
4 Johnson and Stafford (1999) provide a detailed review of the theoretical and empirical issues associated with the
relationship between trade and wage inequality and references to the huge literature on the latter.  Leamer (1997)
provides a somewhat different view.
5 Freeman and Oostendorp (2000) provide a detailed discussion of the enormous difficulty of comparing the available
international wage data. Deaton (2001) provides a general discussion of similar issues in the measurement of poverty.

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

5

draw strong conclusions.  Nevertheless, as these data stand they indicate that adjustments to the
Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek model of trade flows that are derived by assuming that wage rates reflect
workers of different (cid:147)quality(cid:148) will have a hard time explaining our findings.

Interpretation and Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a simple, credible measure of wage rates for identical jobs in
countries that are at very different stages of development. These wage measures indicate that
similar work is compensated at dramatically different rates, whether measured in US dollars at
current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity using the price of the Big Macs that
these workers produce.

These results imply three key conclusions. First, it is apparent that there are considerable

differences in living standards for workers performing essentially identical tasks in different
countries. These large differences in living standards across countries appear to have little or
nothing to do with differences in the skills of these workers or in the non-pecuniary characteristics
of the jobs these workers hold. This suggests that models of economic development in which
organizational and structural differences account for differences in income levels are of
considerable importance.

Second, as Figure 1 indicates, it is also apparent that within some country groups, such as
Western Europe, the USA, and Japan, there is a striking similarity in wage rates whether measured
in a common currency or with  purchasing-power adjustments. This suggests that models of trade
flows that assume factor-price-equalization among these countries may well be empirically
successful, but that other assumptions will be required in tests that are more expansive.  These
results also suggest that there is little reason to expect substantial mobility across the borders of
these countries, but more reason to expect mobility from other parts of Europe into these countries
should this become feasible.

Finally, in future research it would be useful to collect similar data on wage rates for

standardized occupations over time. Among other things, this would begin to provide the factual
basis to appraise economic reforms being undertaken in both the transitional and developing
countries.  We believe that our own research demonstrates that this is a feasible task and that it
could be carried out with a modicum of resources.

The Big Mac Index

Abstract

Comparisons of wage rates across countries have become key ingredients in
evaluating theories of international trade, the role of trade in exacerbating
wage inequality, and the role of capitalist reforms  in economic  transition.
Despite  the  importance  of  cross-country  wage  comparisons,  it  is  widely
agreed  that  no  credible,  comparable  wage  estimates  exist.  This  paper
suggests  a  simple  procedure  for  comparing  the  average  wage  rate  of
workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in
McDonald’s  restaurants  in  27  countries  that  are  at  dramatically  different
stages of economic development. Real wage rates are computed at current
exchange  rates,  and  also  after  adjustment  for  purchasing  power  parity  in
units  of  (cid:147)Big  Macs(cid:148)  per  hour.  The  results  indicate  that  real  wages  for
identical jobs in the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe are some four to five

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide
simple, easily collected, and credible measures of real wage rates that may be compared across
widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-
                                                          
1 See, for example, Deaton and Terraza (2000), which has been widely discussed in the popular press of India, and
which provides new computations of poverty rates before and after economic reforms, and which has become a major
source of discussions of the desirability of further reforms.
2 Trefler (1993), like the much earlier work of Krueger (1968), uses the assumption that measured wage differences
reflect productivity differences.  Work by Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997) attempts to tailor
assumptions  to the likely presence or absence of factor price equalization.
3 Mokhtari and Rassekh (1989) provide a survey of earlier direct empirical tests and evidence favorable to FPE among
the OECD countries.  O(cid:146)Rourke and Williamson (1996) study the historical record,  while more recent indirect tests are
contained in Hanson and Slaughter (1999) and Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2001)
4 Johnson and Stafford (1999) provide a detailed review of the theoretical and empirical issues associated with the
relationship between trade and wage inequality and references to the huge literature on the latter.  Leamer (1997)
provides a somewhat different view.
5 Freeman and Oostendorp (2000) provide a detailed discussion of the enormous difficulty of comparing the available
international wage data. Deaton (2001) provides a general discussion of similar issues in the measurement of poverty.

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

5

draw strong conclusions.  Nevertheless, as these data stand they indicate that adjustments to the
Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek model of trade flows that are derived by assuming that wage rates reflect
workers of different (cid:147)quality(cid:148) will have a hard time explaining our findings.

Interpretation and Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a simple, credible measure of wage rates for identical jobs in
countries that are at very different stages of development. These wage measures indicate that
similar work is compensated at dramatically different rates, whether measured in US dollars at
current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity using the price of the Big Macs that
these workers produce.

These results imply three key conclusions. First, it is apparent that there are considerable

differences in living standards for workers performing essentially identical tasks in different
countries. These large differences in living standards across countries appear to have little or
nothing to do with differences in the skills of these workers or in the non-pecuniary characteristics
of the jobs these workers hold. This suggests that models of economic development in which
organizational and structural differences account for differences in income levels are of
considerable importance.

Second, as Figure 1 indicates, it is also apparent that within some country groups, such as
Western Europe, the USA, and Japan, there is a striking similarity in wage rates whether measured
in a common currency or with  purchasing-power adjustments. This suggests that models of trade
flows that assume factor-price-equalization among these countries may well be empirically
successful, but that other assumptions will be required in tests that are more expansive.  These
results also suggest that there is little reason to expect substantial mobility across the borders of
these countries, but more reason to expect mobility from other parts of Europe into these countries
should this become feasible.

Finally, in future research it would be useful to collect similar data on wage rates for

standardized occupations over time. Among other things, this would begin to provide the factual
basis to appraise economic reforms being undertaken in both the transitional and developing
countries.  We believe that our own research demonstrates that this is a feasible task and that it
could be carried out with a modicum of resources.

Abstract

Comparisons of wage rates across countries have become key ingredients in
evaluating theories of international trade, the role of trade in exacerbating
wage inequality, and the role of capitalist reforms  in economic  transition.
Despite  the  importance  of  cross-country  wage  comparisons,  it  is  widely
agreed  that  no  credible,  comparable  wage  estimates  exist.  This  paper
suggests  a  simple  procedure  for  comparing  the  average  wage  rate  of
workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in
McDonald’s  restaurants  in  27  countries  that  are  at  dramatically  different
stages of economic development. Real wage rates are computed at current
exchange  rates,  and  also  after  adjustment  for  purchasing  power  parity  in
units  of  (cid:147)Big  Macs(cid:148)  per  hour.  The  results  indicate  that  real  wages  for
identical jobs in the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe are some four to five
times  higher  than  in  Eastern  Europe,  Korea,  or  Brazil,  and  an  order  of
magnitude higher than in China, India, or Colombia.

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide
simple, easily collected, and credible measures of real wage rates that may be compared across
widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-
                                                          
1 See, for example, Deaton and Terraza (2000), which has been widely discussed in the popular press of India, and
which provides new computations of poverty rates before and after economic reforms, and which has become a major
source of discussions of the desirability of further reforms.
2 Trefler (1993), like the much earlier work of Krueger (1968), uses the assumption that measured wage differences
reflect productivity differences.  Work by Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997) attempts to tailor
assumptions  to the likely presence or absence of factor price equalization.
3 Mokhtari and Rassekh (1989) provide a survey of earlier direct empirical tests and evidence favorable to FPE among
the OECD countries.  O(cid:146)Rourke and Williamson (1996) study the historical record,  while more recent indirect tests are
contained in Hanson and Slaughter (1999) and Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2001)
4 Johnson and Stafford (1999) provide a detailed review of the theoretical and empirical issues associated with the
relationship between trade and wage inequality and references to the huge literature on the latter.  Leamer (1997)
provides a somewhat different view.
5 Freeman and Oostendorp (2000) provide a detailed discussion of the enormous difficulty of comparing the available
international wage data. Deaton (2001) provides a general discussion of similar issues in the measurement of poverty.

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

5

draw strong conclusions.  Nevertheless, as these data stand they indicate that adjustments to the
Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek model of trade flows that are derived by assuming that wage rates reflect
workers of different (cid:147)quality(cid:148) will have a hard time explaining our findings.

Interpretation and Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a simple, credible measure of wage rates for identical jobs in
countries that are at very different stages of development. These wage measures indicate that
similar work is compensated at dramatically different rates, whether measured in US dollars at
current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity using the price of the Big Macs that
these workers produce.

These results imply three key conclusions. First, it is apparent that there are considerable

differences in living standards for workers performing essentially identical tasks in different
countries. These large differences in living standards across countries appear to have little or
nothing to do with differences in the skills of these workers or in the non-pecuniary characteristics
of the jobs these workers hold. This suggests that models of economic development in which
organizational and structural differences account for differences in income levels are of
considerable importance.

Second, as Figure 1 indicates, it is also apparent that within some country groups, such as
Western Europe, the USA, and Japan, there is a striking similarity in wage rates whether measured
in a common currency or with  purchasing-power adjustments. This suggests that models of trade
flows that assume factor-price-equalization among these countries may well be empirically
successful, but that other assumptions will be required in tests that are more expansive.  These
results also suggest that there is little reason to expect substantial mobility across the borders of
these countries, but more reason to expect mobility from other parts of Europe into these countries
should this become feasible.

Finally, in future research it would be useful to collect similar data on wage rates for

standardized occupations over time. Among other things, this would begin to provide the factual
basis to appraise economic reforms being undertaken in both the transitional and developing
countries.  We believe that our own research demonstrates that this is a feasible task and that it
could be carried out with a modicum of resources.

The Big Mac Index

Abstract

Comparisons of wage rates across countries have become key ingredients in
evaluating theories of international trade, the role of trade in exacerbating
wage inequality, and the role of capitalist reforms  in economic  transition.
Despite  the  importance  of  cross-country  wage  comparisons,  it  is  widely
agreed  that  no  credible,  comparable  wage  estimates  exist.  This  paper
suggests  a  simple  procedure  for  comparing  the  average  wage  rate  of
workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in
McDonald’s  restaurants  in  27  countries  that  are  at  dramatically  different
stages of economic development. Real wage rates are computed at current
exchange  rates,  and  also  after  adjustment  for  purchasing  power  parity  in
units  of  (cid:147)Big  Macs(cid:148)  per  hour.  The  results  indicate  that  real  wages  for
identical jobs in the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe are some four to five
times  higher  than  in  Eastern  Europe,  Korea,  or  Brazil,  and  an  order  of
magnitude higher than in China, India, or Colombia.

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide
simple, easily collected, and credible measures of real wage rates that may be compared across
widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-
                                                          
1 See, for example, Deaton and Terraza (2000), which has been widely discussed in the popular press of India, and
which provides new computations of poverty rates before and after economic reforms, and which has become a major
source of discussions of the desirability of further reforms.
2 Trefler (1993), like the much earlier work of Krueger (1968), uses the assumption that measured wage differences
reflect productivity differences.  Work by Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997) attempts to tailor
assumptions  to the likely presence or absence of factor price equalization.
3 Mokhtari and Rassekh (1989) provide a survey of earlier direct empirical tests and evidence favorable to FPE among
the OECD countries.  O(cid:146)Rourke and Williamson (1996) study the historical record,  while more recent indirect tests are
contained in Hanson and Slaughter (1999) and Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2001)
4 Johnson and Stafford (1999) provide a detailed review of the theoretical and empirical issues associated with the
relationship between trade and wage inequality and references to the huge literature on the latter.  Leamer (1997)
provides a somewhat different view.
5 Freeman and Oostendorp (2000) provide a detailed discussion of the enormous difficulty of comparing the available
international wage data. Deaton (2001) provides a general discussion of similar issues in the measurement of poverty.

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

4

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

5

draw strong conclusions.  Nevertheless, as these data stand they indicate that adjustments to the
Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek model of trade flows that are derived by assuming that wage rates reflect
workers of different (cid:147)quality(cid:148) will have a hard time explaining our findings.

Interpretation and Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a simple, credible measure of wage rates for identical jobs in
countries that are at very different stages of development. These wage measures indicate that
similar work is compensated at dramatically different rates, whether measured in US dollars at
current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity using the price of the Big Macs that
these workers produce.

These results imply three key conclusions. First, it is apparent that there are considerable

differences in living standards for workers performing essentially identical tasks in different
countries. These large differences in living standards across countries appear to have little or
nothing to do with differences in the skills of these workers or in the non-pecuniary characteristics
of the jobs these workers hold. This suggests that models of economic development in which
organizational and structural differences account for differences in income levels are of
considerable importance.

Second, as Figure 1 indicates, it is also apparent that within some country groups, such as
Western Europe, the USA, and Japan, there is a striking similarity in wage rates whether measured
in a common currency or with  purchasing-power adjustments. This suggests that models of trade
flows that assume factor-price-equalization among these countries may well be empirically
successful, but that other assumptions will be required in tests that are more expansive.  These
results also suggest that there is little reason to expect substantial mobility across the borders of
these countries, but more reason to expect mobility from other parts of Europe into these countries
should this become feasible.

Finally, in future research it would be useful to collect similar data on wage rates for

standardized occupations over time. Among other things, this would begin to provide the factual
basis to appraise economic reforms being undertaken in both the transitional and developing
countries.  We believe that our own research demonstrates that this is a feasible task and that it
could be carried out with a modicum of resources.

The Big Mac Index

Abstract

Comparisons of wage rates across countries have become key ingredients in
evaluating theories of international trade, the role of trade in exacerbating
wage inequality, and the role of capitalist reforms  in economic  transition.
Despite  the  importance  of  cross-country  wage  comparisons,  it  is  widely
agreed  that  no  credible,  comparable  wage  estimates  exist.  This  paper
suggests  a  simple  procedure  for  comparing  the  average  wage  rate  of
workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in
McDonald’s  restaurants  in  27  countries  that  are  at  dramatically  different
stages of economic development. Real wage rates are computed at current
exchange  rates,  and  also  after  adjustment  for  purchasing  power  parity  in
units  of  (cid:147)Big  Macs(cid:148)  per  hour.  The  results  indicate  that  real  wages  for
identical jobs in the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe are some four to five
times  higher  than  in  Eastern  Europe,  Korea,  or  Brazil,  and  an  order  of
magnitude higher than in China, India, or Colombia.

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide
simple, easily collected, and credible measures of real wage rates that may be compared across
widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-
                                                          
1 See, for example, Deaton and Terraza (2000), which has been widely discussed in the popular press of India, and
which provides new computations of poverty rates before and after economic reforms, and which has become a major
source of discussions of the desirability of further reforms.
2 Trefler (1993), like the much earlier work of Krueger (1968), uses the assumption that measured wage differences
reflect productivity differences.  Work by Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997) attempts to tailor
assumptions  to the likely presence or absence of factor price equalization.
3 Mokhtari and Rassekh (1989) provide a survey of earlier direct empirical tests and evidence favorable to FPE among

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

5

draw strong conclusions.  Nevertheless, as these data stand they indicate that adjustments to the
Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek model of trade flows that are derived by assuming that wage rates reflect
workers of different (cid:147)quality(cid:148) will have a hard time explaining our findings.

Interpretation and Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a simple, credible measure of wage rates for identical jobs in
countries that are at very different stages of development. These wage measures indicate that
similar work is compensated at dramatically different rates, whether measured in US dollars at
current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity using the price of the Big Macs that
these workers produce.

These results imply three key conclusions. First, it is apparent that there are considerable

differences in living standards for workers performing essentially identical tasks in different
countries. These large differences in living standards across countries appear to have little or
nothing to do with differences in the skills of these workers or in the non-pecuniary characteristics
of the jobs these workers hold. This suggests that models of economic development in which
organizational and structural differences account for differences in income levels are of
considerable importance.

Second, as Figure 1 indicates, it is also apparent that within some country groups, such as
Western Europe, the USA, and Japan, there is a striking similarity in wage rates whether measured
in a common currency or with  purchasing-power adjustments. This suggests that models of trade
flows that assume factor-price-equalization among these countries may well be empirically
successful, but that other assumptions will be required in tests that are more expansive.  These
results also suggest that there is little reason to expect substantial mobility across the borders of
these countries, but more reason to expect mobility from other parts of Europe into these countries
should this become feasible.

Finally, in future research it would be useful to collect similar data on wage rates for

standardized occupations over time. Among other things, this would begin to provide the factual
basis to appraise economic reforms being undertaken in both the transitional and developing
countries.  We believe that our own research demonstrates that this is a feasible task and that it
could be carried out with a modicum of resources.

Abstract

Comparisons of wage rates across countries have become key ingredients in
evaluating theories of international trade, the role of trade in exacerbating
wage inequality, and the role of capitalist reforms  in economic  transition.
Despite  the  importance  of  cross-country  wage  comparisons,  it  is  widely
agreed  that  no  credible,  comparable  wage  estimates  exist.  This  paper
suggests  a  simple  procedure  for  comparing  the  average  wage  rate  of
workers in identical jobs in different countries and over time. The procedure
is implemented with new data we have collected on average wage rates in
McDonald’s  restaurants  in  27  countries  that  are  at  dramatically  different
stages of economic development. Real wage rates are computed at current
exchange  rates,  and  also  after  adjustment  for  purchasing  power  parity  in
units  of  (cid:147)Big  Macs(cid:148)  per  hour.  The  results  indicate  that  real  wages  for
identical jobs in the U.S., Japan, and Western Europe are some four to five
times  higher  than  in  Eastern  Europe,  Korea,  or  Brazil,  and  an  order  of
magnitude higher than in China, India, or Colombia.

Introduction

In this paper we report comparisons of basic wage rates for workers in identical jobs located in 27
countries that vary widely in their levels of economic development. Our primary goal is to provide
simple, easily collected, and credible measures of real wage rates that may be compared across
widely varied economic circumstances.

Our purpose in undertaking this analysis is fourfold.  First, as more countries move toward

market based economies, comparisons of living standards across countries and over time have
become key ingredients in evaluating the success and desirability of economic reforms. Since the
institutional stakes are high and the necessary data are difficult to obtain, considerable controversy
has developed over issues that should, in principle, be matters of fact.1  We propose and implement
a simple data collection method that could be useful in resolving some of these controversies.

Second, the flurry of recent work testing the basic predictions of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek

model of trade flows has highlighted the importance of the role of factor price equalization (FPE)
as a key assumption in tests of the theory.2  In practice, despite considerable anecdotal evidence,
there have been few direct tests of FPE.3  Our goal in this paper is to offer direct evidence on factor
price equalization by quantifying where it appears to survive straightforward, direct observation.
Third, the extent to which changing patterns of trade are expected to affect the distribution
of wages depends critically upon the extent to which the developed and developing economies are
integrated.  The existence of factor price differences provides key evidence on the nature and extent
of the integration among trading partners and on the extent to which increasing integration may be
expected to affect within-country wage inequality.4

Finally, providing comparable data on wage rates, incomes, or prices in widely different
institutional settings raises many problems of both interpretation and implementation.5 We have
deliberately avoided many of these problems by collecting data on a narrowly defined, company-
                                                          
1 See, for example, Deaton and Terraza (2000), which has been widely discussed in the popular press of India, and
which provides new computations of poverty rates before and after economic reforms, and which has become a major
source of discussions of the desirability of further reforms.
2 Trefler (1993), like the much earlier work of Krueger (1968), uses the assumption that measured wage differences
reflect productivity differences.  Work by Davis, Weinstein, Bradford, and Shimpo (1997) attempts to tailor
assumptions  to the likely presence or absence of factor price equalization.
3 Mokhtari and Rassekh (1989) provide a survey of earlier direct empirical tests and evidence favorable to FPE among
the OECD countries.  O(cid:146)Rourke and Williamson (1996) study the historical record,  while more recent indirect tests are
contained in Hanson and Slaughter (1999) and Bernard, Jensen, and Schott (2001)
4 Johnson and Stafford (1999) provide a detailed review of the theoretical and empirical issues associated with the
relationship between trade and wage inequality and references to the huge literature on the latter.  Leamer (1997)
provides a somewhat different view.
5 Freeman and Oostendorp (2000) provide a detailed discussion of the enormous difficulty of comparing the available
international wage data. Deaton (2001) provides a general discussion of similar issues in the measurement of poverty.

specific job that exists in many countries. Although there are many possibilities, we have chosen to
collect data on the wage rate in the basic entry-level job at McDonald’s restaurants. These
restaurants exist in many countries at dramatically different levels of development and provide us
the ability to measure wages for virtually identical jobs by those producing identical products.
Since these data are comparable across countries, we believe they may provide a benchmark with
which to determine the reliability of other, more widely reported wage measures.

In addition to basic wage rates, we also collected data on the price of a Big Mac in each

country surveyed. The Big Mac is a standardized hamburger sandwich that is produced in virtually
all McDonald’s restaurants. The price of Big Macs has been continuously compiled by the
Economist since 1986 as an easily obtained measure of purchasing power parity, and we use these
data for the same purpose here. We measure hourly wage rates in local currency, in US dollars at
current exchange rates, and in units of (cid:147)Big Macs.(cid:148)  Wage rates measured in a common currency
provide a simple test for the equalization of factor prices, while wage rates measured in (cid:147)Big Macs(cid:148)
provide a measure of worker welfare that is adjusted for one simple measure of purchasing power
parity (PPP).  We also compare the PPP adjustment implied by the Big Mac index with other
measures.

The results of our analysis indicate that there are extraordinarily large differences in the

wage rates of workers doing identical jobs in countries at different levels of economic
development. Loosely speaking, base wage rates(cid:151)whether measured in US$ or Big Macs(cid:151)are
quite similar among the Western European countries, Japan, and the US.  However, wage rates in
these countries are  some 3 to 5 times higher than they are in Eastern Europe, Korea, or Brazil, and
an order of magnitude higher than they are in China, India, or Colombia. Among the developed
countries wage measurements are not much different whether adjusted for purchasing power parity
and they are not sensitive to which PPP adjustment is used.  Among the least developed countries
wage rates differ depending on whether the measurements are made in US$ or with a purchasing
power parity adjustment, as well as by which PPP adjustment is used.

Measurement of Wages and Prices

Wage Rates

We selected McDonald’s restaurants for the measurement of wage rates because these restaurants
operate with a standardized protocol for employee work. Food ingredients are delivered to the
restaurant and stored in standardized coolers and freezers. These ingredients are handled using a

2

highly mechanized food preparation system with equipment that differs very little from place to
place. Although the skills necessary to handle contracts with suppliers or to manage and select
employees may differ among restaurants, the basic food preparation work in each restaurant is
highly standardized.  Employees typically start work at a food preparation station, and are then
rotated through various stations and eventually to the sales counter. As a result, workers may
undertake several different assignments at different times.

A key motivation for the use of standardized work protocols is the implied warrantee of

food safety that eating at a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant provides when a traveler has little information
about the quality of local establishments.  The standardized McDonald(cid:146)s brand is both a risk (in
case of some failure) and a reward (when failure is rare). We suspect there are other internationally
diversified companies that have a similar structure and that might also make suitable candidates for
data collection.

Wage rates differ within each country and across countries. Differences in wage rates within

a country are typically related to shift premia, seniority, and full-time/part-time status. In general
our data refer to the gross wage, without any adjustment for taxes. Since these differences may
affect our results, we describe how we handled each issue in a detailed data appendix. We initially
collected data in the month of December 1998 for the limited list of 13 countries contained in Table
1.  Since the data collection went quite smoothly we were able to collect data for 27 countries
during the summer of 2000.  In general, these data refer a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurant operating in a
large urban area, typically a capitol city.

Our survey was carried out with the cooperation of the McKinsey Global Institute.

Although we have relied on McKinsey’s analysts for most of our information on wages, we visited
a McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants in the Czech Republic to verify McKinsey’s work and to inspect the
methods of operation. As indicated in Table 1, McKinsey reported an average wage rate of 47
crowns per hour and the price of a Big Mac at 53 crowns in December 1998. As the Table
indicates, these data imply a wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour in the Czech Republic. In our own
survey in the summer of 2000 we found an average wage rate of 50 crowns, with the price of a Big
Mac at 56 crowns. These figures imply an annual inflation rate of about 4% and an unchanged
average wage rate of .89 Big Macs per hour. These figures are consistent with what is known about
the local inflation rate and with what was reported by the McKinsey analysts for the purchasing
power adjusted wage rate.  When McKinsey returned to the Czech Republic in 2000 they reported
an average wage rate of 45 crowns and a Big Mac price of 53 crowns.

These comparisons provide some indication of the nature of the variability that no doubt

will exist in any data collection of this type.  Although we are certain that the within-country

3

variability in wages at McDonald(cid:146)s restaurants is small compared to the across-county variability
we report below, it would be useful to have explicit within-country variance measures.

Prices

Since we wanted to construct purchasing power parity adjustments that were coincident with the
timing of our collection of wage data, we also collected the price of a Big Mac in each country at
the time of the wage survey. Big Mac prices are reported regularly by the Economist and have, in
fact, been studied by Cumby (1996)6 for evidence of purchasing power parity adjustments.

To measure the reliability of our estimates of Big Mac prices we compared our estimates
with those from the Economist. Columns 5 and 6 in Table 1 contain the relevant data on Big Mac
prices evaluated in US$ for each country. A straightforward measure of the reliability of these
estimates is provided by the correlation between the two measures of the US$ Big Mac price. For
the nine countries for which we have two independent measures in 1998 the correlation is .87,7
while this correlation is 0.99 in 2000, indicating that most of the variance across countries is due to
variation in the true price, not to measurement error.

Empirical Findings

Wages in a Common Currency:  The basic results of our first and second surveys are contained in
Tables 1 and 2. The first column in each table provides our estimate of the wage rate in local
currency units, while the second provides our estimate of the price of a Big Mac in the local
currency. The third column in Tables 1 and 2 contains the exchange rate (in local currency units per
US$) at the time of the data collection. These are the basic data from our survey.

The fourth column of Tables 1 and 2 provides our measures of the local average wage rate

expressed in US$. It is apparent that these wage rates vary dramatically.  In 2000, for example,
wage rates (in US$) varied from a low of $.29 in India to a high of $7.73 in Japan.

We think there are two broad conclusions supported by these data:
(1) It is apparent that the data strongly rule out the equality of wage rates measured in a

common currency, as would be implied by factor price equalization.  Figure 1 shows this disparity
                                                          
6 Cumby (1996) suggests that although average deviations from absolute Big Mac parity are large for several
currencies, convergence to relative Big Mac parity is quite rapid. In addition, deviations from relative Big Mac parity
appear to provide useful information for forecasting exchange rates.
7 The obvious outlier in the comparison of Big Mac prices is Brazil(cid:151)if this observation is deleted the correlation
between the two measure of price is .97.

graphically.  It is an overwhelming strong confirmation of vast disparity in wages rates that has
often been referred to only anecdotally.

(2) Aside from the striking overall inequality in wages demonstrated in Tables 1 and 2, what

is most notable about these data is the striking equality of wage rates among the OECD countries;
that is, among the countries of Western Europe, the USA, and Japan.  Wage differences among
these countries typically are no more than 10% to 15%(cid:150)very small when compared to the likely
measurement error in our data.

Prices: The fifth column of Table 2 contains the US$ price of a Big Mac. These prices range from a
low of $1.20 in several Asian countries, including China and India, in Russia to a high of $3.02 in
the UK.  There are two striking conclusions from the data on prices:

(1) The price of a Big Mac is far less variable than the wage of someone who makes a Big

Mac.  Figure 2 shows the relation between the US$ price and wages.  It is apparent that the slope of
the relation is far below unity.  Indeed, a regression of price on the wage rate gives a slope of .17 (t-
value of 4.4).

(2) Using the price of a Big Mac it is possible to construct a simple purchasing-power-parity

adjusted wage rate for McDonald(cid:146)s workers in each country.  This measure of the number of Big
Macs that an hour of work will buy is contained in column (7) of Table 2.  It is immediately
apparent that because the price of a Big Mac varies so little, this PPP-adjusted wage rate is highly
correlated with the hourly wage expressed in a common currency.  Figure 3 shows the relationship.
In short, making this adjustment in purchasing power narrows the gap in wages between the highest
and lowest wage workers by about one-half, but it does little to change the rank order of the wage
differences and leaves dramatic wage differences remaining.

Comparison with Other Wages:  Table 3 contains detailed data on other wage rates that we have
been able to collect.  Our goal in collecting these data was to see whether they were highly
correlated with the wage rates we had collected.  Columns (7)-(9) provide our estimates of other
wage rates for workers in manufacturing and for construction laborers in several countries in
various years.

As Figures 4 and 5 indicate there is a very high correlation between the wages of workers as

we have measured them and the more conventional wage measures we have been able to obtain.
These results indicate that the wage differences observed in the conventional sources are not the
result of inherent productivity differences among the laborers or manufacturing workers
represented in the data sets.  Unfortunately these data are relatively sparse, and we are reluctant to

5

draw strong conclusions.  Nevertheless, as these data stand they indicate that adjustments to the
Hecksher-Ohlin-Vanek model of trade flows that are derived by assuming that wage rates reflect
workers of different (cid:147)quality(cid:148) will have a hard time explaining our findings.

Interpretation and Conclusion

In this paper we have provided a simple, credible measure of wage rates for identical jobs in
countries that are at very different stages of development. These wage measures indicate that
similar work is compensated at dramatically different rates, whether measured in US dollars at
current exchange rates or adjusted for purchasing power parity using the price of the Big Macs that
these workers produce.

These results imply three key conclusions. First, it is apparent that there are considerable

differences in living standards for workers performing essentially identical tasks in different
countries. These large differences in living standards across countries appear to have little or
nothing to do with differences in the skills of these workers or in the non-pecuniary characteristics
of the jobs these workers hold. This suggests that models of economic development in which
organizational and structural differences account for differences in income levels are of
considerable importance.

Second, as Figure 1 indicates, it is also apparent that within some country groups, such as
Western Europe, the USA, and Japan, there is a striking similarity in wage rates whether measured
in a common currency or with  purchasing-power adjustments. This suggests that models of trade
flows that assume factor-price-equalization among these countries may well be empirically
successful, but that other assumptions will be required in tests that are more expansive.  These
results also suggest that there is little reason to expect substantial mobility across the borders of
these countries, but more reason to expect mobility from other parts of Europe into these countries
should this become feasible.

Finally, in future research it would be useful to collect similar data on wage rates for

standardized occupations over time. Among other things, this would begin to provide the factual
basis to appraise economic reforms being undertaken in both the transitional and developing
countries.  We believe that our own research demonstrates that this is a feasible task and that it
could be carried out with a modicum of resources.
