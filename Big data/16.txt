1. Introduction 

The technology landscape is evolving rapidly with the 
advent  of  fine-grained  sensor  rich  computing  devices 
(Smartphones, Wearables, IoTs), communication channels 
(Wi-Fi  Direct,  IPv6),  and  cloud  computing  technologies 
[1]. The amount of data generated in pervasive, ubiquitous, 
and big data environments is increasing in size, speed, and 
variety.  Therefore,  the  challenge  of  uncovering  useful 
knowledge  patterns  from  these  massive  stacks  of  data  is 
increasing day by day. On the other hand, modern digital 
devices  are  being  empowered  by  computational  and 
storage  facilities  [2].  We  perceive 
that  the  proper 
utilization of these on-board resources can bring a new life 
to big data systems. 

Mobile data mining systems (MDMS) play a vital role 
in utilization of on-board resources to uncover knowledge 
patterns in user locality and provision of local knowledge 
for  immediate  local  utilization  [3].  Existing  MDMS  are 
facing the challenges of limited amount of memory, CPU 
power, battery, and visualization facilities [4]. A thorough 
literature  review  exhibits  that  variety  of  MDMS  were 
proposed  to  handle  the  challenges  of  context-awareness, 
energy-efficiency, 
knowledge 
discovery,  and  adaptive  computations  according  to  on-
board  available  resources  [5].  Therefore,  all 
these 
challenges  are  needed  to  be  considered  while  designing 
the MDMS.

approach  is  more  appropriate  for  real-time  data 
analysis.  In  this  case  big  data  systems  need  to 
compromise  on  the  value  of  overall  knowledge 
patterns due to one-time processing requirements of 
data streams. 

In  addition,  MDMS  also  work  in  distributed  settings. 
These  distributed  settings  include  peer-to-peer  ad-hoc 
networks,  cloud  enabled  MDMS  or  hybrid  execution 
models.  PDM  is  an  adaptive  light-weight  MDMS  that 
works in mobile peer to peer distributed environments [5]. 
PDM  is  based  on agent-oriented  data mining  framework 
where  different  software  agents  collaborate  to  perform 
collective  knowledge  discovery  in  peer-to-peer  settings. 
PDM  harnesses  granularity-based  approaches  to  execute 
data mining algorithms in adaptive settings. On the other

3. Big Data Problem 

Various big data environments have emerged after the 
expansion  of  big  data  ecosystem  in  multiple  dimensions 
[12].  These  environments  vary  from  in-lab  scientific 
experiments  to  generation  and  collection  of  remote 
sensory  data  from  heterogeneous  data  sources.  A  large 
number of big data environments have emerged for social 
media  and  business  analytics  systems  as  well.  The 
massive data production and heterogeneity of data sources 
has created big data problem (a.k.a. data complexity). This 
data complexity is due to different v’s phenomenon. These 
v’s include volume, velocity, variety, value, veracity, and 
variability [13].  

•  Volume:  The  size  of  the  data  produced  in  big  data 
systems refers to the volume. Generally, a data size 
which could not be easily processed by conventional 
systems is known to be volume of big data. Although 
it terms to be the large data size but it significantly 
varies 
in  different  computational  systems.  For 
example,  A  few  GB  file  is  a  big  data  file  for  a 
smartphone  buy  it  may  not  be  the  case  for  PC  or 
cloud enabled systems. Similarly, a few TB file is a 
big data file for a PC but a cloud enabled system may 
handle it easily. Likewise, few PB size of data set is 
big data for cloud-based big data systems. 

•  Velocity:  The  speed  of  incoming  data  streams 
determines the velocity property of big data system. 
Velocity is the key challenge in big data systems that 
increases  latency  in  the  big  systems.  Big  data 
systems handles velocity in two ways: 1) raw data is 
collected in central data stores for lateral analysis or 
2)  online  data  analysis  of  data  streams  right  after 
acquisition  is  performed.  In  the  first  approach,  big 
data systems create a delay between data acquisition 
and  knowledge  discovery.  This  strategy  is  more 
useful  for  analysis  of  historical  data.  The  second 

 

•  Variety: The heterogeneity of data sources and data 
formats  in  big  data  systems  are  represented  by  the 
variety property of big data. Data sources for big data 
systems  vary  in  terms  of  sensory  and  non-sensory 
data  sources. 
the  structured  and 
unstructured data formats also increase variety in big 
data  systems.  Big  data  systems  handles  the  variety 
challenge 
uncover  maximum 
knowledge patterns 

In  addition, 

effectively 

•  Veracity:  The 

trustworthiness  of  big  data 

is 
represented  by  veracity  property  of  big  data.  This 
property is based on the authenticity of data sources 
and  correctness  of  data.  The  effective  handling  of 
veracity  property  of  big  data  improves  the  overall 
effectiveness of the system. 

to 

•  Variability:  The  handling  of  inconsistencies  in  big 
data is  attributed  with  variability.  The  variable  data 
rates  causes  computational  overhead  in  peak-load 
times  therefore  a  proper  handling  of  variability 
property increases the usefulness of big data systems. 
•  Value: The  interestingness  of  uncovered  knowledge 
patterns  is represented  by  the  value  property  of  big 
data systems. The value is directly affected by other 
5V’s 
(velocity,  volume,  variety,  veracity,  and 
variability)  therefore  a  proper  balance  between  all 
V’s  brings  more  value  in  the  big  data  system.  In 
addition,  the  effective  handling  of  all  other  V’s  is 
directly proportional to increased value of big data. 

3.1. Big Data Complexity 

Six  V’s  give  the  multi-dimensional  view  of  big  data 
hence increase data complexity in big data systems. Data 
engineers  are needed  to  handle  all  six  V’s  effectively  to 
increases the overall value of big data systems as well as 
handle  the  data  complexity.  To  handle  data  complexity, 
the  volumes  should  be  reduced  in  manageable  size  to 
effectively  and  properly  apply  knowledge  discovery 
algorithms.  The  velocity  should  be  managed  in  case  of 
online  data  analysis  so 
that  one-pass  data  streams 
algorithms could be applied effectively. The systems must 
be able to handle the data streams coming from multiple 
data sources in various formats so that information fusion 
algorithms  could  be  applied  effectively.  The  maximum 
and  complete  data  should  be  acquired  from  known  data 
sources to handle the veracity and systems must be able to 
adapt with varying data loads to handle variability of big 
data. Finally an overall balance between velocity, variety, 
volume,  variability  and  veracity  should  be  made  to 
harness the maximum value from big data. 

4. Pattern-based Data Sharing 

Conventionally, most or all of the raw data streams in 
big  data  systems  are  collected  at  central  data  stores  for 
lateral  analytics.  But  the  increasing  growth  in  MDMS 
creates  an  opportunity  to  handle  big  data  problem  and 
increasing  data  complexity  near  the  data  sources.  Here,

property increases the usefulness of big data systems. 
•  Value: The  interestingness  of  uncovered  knowledge 
patterns  is represented  by  the  value  property  of  big 
data systems. The value is directly affected by other 
5V’s 
(velocity,  volume,  variety,  veracity,  and 
variability)  therefore  a  proper  balance  between  all 
V’s  brings  more  value  in  the  big  data  system.  In 
addition,  the  effective  handling  of  all  other  V’s  is 
directly proportional to increased value of big data. 

3.1. Big Data Complexity 

Six  V’s  give  the  multi-dimensional  view  of  big  data 
hence increase data complexity in big data systems. Data 
engineers  are needed  to  handle  all  six  V’s  effectively  to 
increases the overall value of big data systems as well as 
handle  the  data  complexity.  To  handle  data  complexity, 
the  volumes  should  be  reduced  in  manageable  size  to 
effectively  and  properly  apply  knowledge  discovery 
algorithms.  The  velocity  should  be  managed  in  case  of 
online  data  analysis  so 
that  one-pass  data  streams 
algorithms could be applied effectively. The systems must 
be able to handle the data streams coming from multiple 
data sources in various formats so that information fusion 
algorithms  could  be  applied  effectively.  The  maximum 
and  complete  data  should  be  acquired  from  known  data 
sources to handle the veracity and systems must be able to 
adapt with varying data loads to handle variability of big 
data. Finally an overall balance between velocity, variety, 
volume,  variability  and  veracity  should  be  made  to 
harness the maximum value from big data. 

4. Pattern-based Data Sharing 

Conventionally, most or all of the raw data streams in 
big  data  systems  are  collected  at  central  data  stores  for 
lateral  analytics.  But  the  increasing  growth  in  MDMS 
creates  an  opportunity  to  handle  big  data  problem  and 
increasing  data  complexity  near  the  data  sources.  Here,

shared for further correlation analysis in big data systems.

Figure 1. Pattern-based data sharing workflow 

The workflow of the proposed strategy is based on five 
steps  for:  i)  data  acquisition,  ii)  data  processing,  iii) 
knowledge discovery, iv) pattern sharing, and v) remote data 
management. The details of each step are presented below. 
i) Data acquisition

The data acquisition is done using on-board sensory and 
non-sensory  data  sources.  These  data  sources  include 
accelerometer, 
camera, 
microphone, device-resident data logs, web browser logs, 
personal  contact  information,  message inbox  information 
and  many  other  data  sources.  The  heterogeneity  of  data 
sources  and  variety  of  data  types  bring  a  wealth  of 
information  which,  if  properly  fused  and  analyzed,  it 
could uncover many interesting knowledge patterns. 
ii) Data processing 

sensor, 

The data preprocessing and fusion process takes place 
at  this  stage.  A  variety  of  data  preprocessing  techniques 
for  feature  extraction,  feature  reduction,  noise  and 
dimensionally  reduction  are  applied  at  this  stage.  In 
addition,  the  data  pre-processing  techniques,  to  handle 
missing  values  are  also  handled  at  this  stage.  A  finely 
preprocessed data brings more utility in the later stages of 
pattern sharing workflow. 
iii) Knowledge discovery 

At  this  stage  the  preprocessed  data  is  analyzed  using 
different  data  mining  algorithms 
for  classification, 
clustering,  and  association  rule  mining  algorithms.  The 
discovered patterns (classes, clusters, rules) are evaluated 
using different performance metrics presented in [2]. The 
interesting  patterns are  then available  for  personal  usage 
as well as sharing in big data environments. 
iv) Pattern sharing 

The  interesting  patterns  are  synchronized  with  remote 
data stores in cloud environments. The shared patterns are 
further analyzed in big data environments using different 
big data mining techniques. 
v) Remote data management 

The shared patterns are managed in cloud environments 
using  different 
and  unstructured  data 
management  systems.  Here,  first  the  shared  patterns  are 
analyzed,

5.  Advantages  of  Pattern-based  Data 
Sharing in Big Data Environments 

The  proposed  data  sharing  strategy  has  some  key 

advantages. 

•  Local knowledge availability: The execution of local 
knowledge discovery algorithms  enables the provision 
of local knowledge patterns. Conventionally, user data 
is collected by big data systems but users do not have 
the liberty to utilize the data effectively. This strategy 
brings value to users at personal level as well. 

 

•  Complete  control  over  personal  data:  The  proposed 
data  sharing  strategy  enables  users  to  exercise  full 
control of their personal data patterns. This approach 
enhances user control and privacy-preservation in big 
data environments.  

•  Handles  six  v’s  to  reduce  data  complexity:  The 
enablement  of  knowledge  discovery  process 
execution near data sources helps to reduce big data 
complexity  in  all  six  dimensions.  For  example,  the 
volume of big data is decreased because raw data is 
processed in local devices and resultant patterns are 
shared in big data environments. The speed (velocity) 
of incoming data streams is reduced because of less 
data  transmission  from  data  sources  to  big  data 
systems.  The  information  about  data  sources  and 
multiple data types is managed at user devices which 
effectively handle the variety of big data. The reason 
is  pattern  based  data  sharing  which  is  a  uniform 
format of patterns coming from all data sources. The 
challenge  of  variability  is  met  due  to  less  volume, 
and  velocity  of  incoming  data  streams.  In  addition, 
the  issue  of  veracity  is  implicitly  handled  by 
proposed strategy where missing values and incorrect 
data are already processed near data sources. Hence 
the  proposed  strategy  reduces  the  possibility  of 
unknown  data  sources  and missing/incomplete  data. 
Finally,  by  overcoming  the  rest  of  V’s  the  overall 
value of big data also increases due to evaluation of 
crispy  patterns  instead  of  raw  data  streams.  The 
effective  hanling  of  six  V’s  of  big  data  reduce  the 
overall big data complexity.  

6. Future Application Areas 

The proposed pattern based data sharing strategy could 
enable  many  application  areas  where  local  knowledge 
discovery  and  big  data  environments  are  involved.  We 
present three such application areas as follows: 
•  Mobile Crowd Sensing Applications 

(smartphones  and  wearable  devices) 

large  number  of  new  applications  are  being 
A 
developed,  where  data  from  users’  personal  sensing 
devices 
is 
collected and analyzed for group recommendations. For 
example,  grocery  stores  collect  user’s  search  behavior 
data  from  web  browser  logs  and  recommends  the 
relevant products accordingly. The proposed strategy in 
this  case  will  only  send  grocery 
items  related 
information to big data environments instead of sending 
all  click  stream  information.  Hence  the  big  data 
complexity  will 
implicitly  be  reduced.  Similarly, 
businesses,  governments,  and  other  service-providers 
can  collect  required  relevant  information  and  reduce 
their computational burden.

Abstract  The  staggering growth in Internet  of Things  (IoTs) technologies is the key  driver  for generation  of 
massive  raw  data  streams  in  big  data  environments.  In  addition,  the  collection  of  raw  data  streams  in  big  data 
systems increases computational complexity and resource consumption in cloud-enabled data mining systems. In 
this paper,  we are introducing the  concept  of  pattern-based data sharing in big data environments. The proposed 
methodology enables local data processing near the data sources and transforms the raw data streams into actionable 
knowledge  patterns.  These  knowledge  patterns  have  dual  utility  of  availability  of  local  knowledge  patterns  for 
immediate actions as well as for participatory data sharing in big data environments. The proposed concept has the 
wide potential to be applied in numerous application areas.

1. Introduction 

The technology landscape is evolving rapidly with the 
advent  of  fine-grained  sensor  rich  computing  devices 
(Smartphones, Wearables, IoTs), communication channels 
(Wi-Fi  Direct,  IPv6),  and  cloud  computing  technologies 
[1]. The amount of data generated in pervasive, ubiquitous, 
and big data environments is increasing in size, speed, and 
variety.  Therefore,  the  challenge  of  uncovering  useful 
knowledge  patterns  from  these  massive  stacks  of  data  is 
increasing day by day. On the other hand, modern digital 
devices  are  being  empowered  by  computational  and 
storage  facilities  [2].  We  perceive 
that  the  proper 
utilization of these on-board resources can bring a new life 
to big data systems. 

Mobile data mining systems (MDMS) play a vital role 
in utilization of on-board resources to uncover knowledge 
patterns in user locality and provision of local knowledge 
for  immediate  local  utilization  [3].  Existing  MDMS  are 
facing the challenges of limited amount of memory, CPU 
power, battery, and visualization facilities [4]. A thorough 
literature  review  exhibits  that  variety  of  MDMS  were 
proposed  to  handle  the  challenges  of  context-awareness, 
energy-efficiency, 
knowledge 
discovery,  and  adaptive  computations  according  to  on-
board  available  resources  [5].  Therefore,  all 
these 
challenges  are  needed  to  be  considered  while  designing 
the MDMS. 

visualization, 

In  this  paper,  we  explained  big  data  environments 
where MDMS could be used as data reducers. Moreover, 
we explained big data problem in detail and proposed the 
concept  of  pattern  based  data  sharing  in  big  data 
environments.  The  proposed  methodology  focuses  on 

local 

 

reduction  of  big  data  in  user-facilities  instead  of  directly 
sharing the data in big data environments. In addition, we 
discussed the advantages of pattern-based data sharing and 
its  future  application  areas.  The  rest  of  the  paper  is 
organized as follows: section-2 discusses related work and 
section-3  discusses  big  data  problem.  In  section-4,  we 
discussed  the  concept  of  pattern  based  data  sharing  and 
the  perceived  advantages  of  proposed  methodology  are 
discussed 
the  perceived 
advantages  are  discussed  and  the  article  is  concluded  in

2. Related Work 

Mobile data mining systems are gaining popularity and 
there are a few well MDMS proposed in recent literature. 
These  MDMS  enables  knowledge  discovery  in  different 
local  and  distributed  modes.  OMM,  StreamAR,  and  Star 
utilize  local  on-board  resources  in  mobile  devices  to 
execute  knowledge  discovery  algorithms  in  light  mode 
and  adaptive  settings  [4,6,7].  The  systems  collect  data 
streams from on-board and off-board sensors, preprocess 
data,  collect  local  resource  information  and  adapt  their 
processing  behaviors  accordingly.  OMM,  in  this  case 
provides a complete toolkit for execution of adaptive and 
light-weight  knowledge  discovery 
[4]. 
StreamAR  collects  accelerometer  data  and  performs 
online  classification  in  adaptive  settings  [6].  Star  is  an 
extension of StreamAR and it deals with concept drift in 
online data stream mining mode on accelerometer data [7]. 
Another  variant  of  local  MDMS  is  mobile  WEKA  that 
provides  a  library  of  data  stream  mining  algorithms  for 
classification,  clustering,  and  association  rule  mining  in 
mobile environments [8].

approach  is  more  appropriate  for  real-time  data 
analysis.  In  this  case  big  data  systems  need  to 
compromise  on  the  value  of  overall  knowledge 
patterns due to one-time processing requirements of 
data streams. 

In  addition,  MDMS  also  work  in  distributed  settings. 
These  distributed  settings  include  peer-to-peer  ad-hoc 
networks,  cloud  enabled  MDMS  or  hybrid  execution 
models.  PDM  is  an  adaptive  light-weight  MDMS  that 
works in mobile peer to peer distributed environments [5]. 
PDM  is  based  on agent-oriented  data mining  framework 
where  different  software  agents  collaborate  to  perform 
collective  knowledge  discovery  in  peer-to-peer  settings. 
PDM  harnesses  granularity-based  approaches  to  execute 
data mining algorithms in adaptive settings. On the other 
hand,  CARDAP  is  a  cloud-enabled  distributed  data 
mining  platform  where  some  data  mining  tasks  are 
performed  locally  using  OMM  and  other  tasks  are 
offloaded 
lateral  knowledge 
discovery  [10].  Finally,  UniMiner  provides  a  hybrid 
execution model that performs knowledge discovery in all 
three  modes  discussed  previously 
[11].  UniMiner 
performs local analytics using on-board local resources in 
context-aware adaptive settings and offloads data mining 
tasks  to  other  peer  devices  in  locality  for  collaborative 
data  mining.  In  case  of  unavailability  of  peer  devices, 
UniMiner  offloads  data  mining 
cloud 
environments.A thorough review of literature exhibits that 
a  variety  of  MDMS  could  be  utilized  for  pattern  based 
data sharing in big data environments.

3. Big Data Problem 

Various big data environments have emerged after the 
expansion  of  big  data  ecosystem  in  multiple  dimensions 
[12].  These  environments  vary  from  in-lab  scientific 
experiments  to  generation  and  collection  of  remote 
sensory  data  from  heterogeneous  data  sources.  A  large 
number of big data environments have emerged for social 
media  and  business  analytics  systems  as  well.  The 
massive data production and heterogeneity of data sources 
has created big data problem (a.k.a. data complexity). This 
data complexity is due to different v’s phenomenon. These 
v’s include volume, velocity, variety, value, veracity, and 
variability [13].  

•  Volume:  The  size  of  the  data  produced  in  big  data 
systems refers to the volume. Generally, a data size 
which could not be easily processed by conventional 
systems is known to be volume of big data. Although 
it terms to be the large data size but it significantly 
varies 
in  different  computational  systems.  For 
example,  A  few  GB  file  is  a  big  data  file  for  a 
smartphone  buy  it  may  not  be  the  case  for  PC  or 
cloud enabled systems. Similarly, a few TB file is a 
big data file for a PC but a cloud enabled system may 
handle it easily. Likewise, few PB size of data set is 
big data for cloud-based big data systems. 

•  Velocity:  The  speed  of  incoming  data  streams 
determines the velocity property of big data system. 
Velocity is the key challenge in big data systems that 
increases  latency  in  the  big  systems.  Big  data 
systems handles velocity in two ways: 1) raw data is 
collected in central data stores for lateral analysis or 
2)  online  data  analysis  of  data  streams  right  after 
acquisition  is  performed.  In  the  first  approach,  big 
data systems create a delay between data acquisition 
and  knowledge  discovery.  This  strategy  is  more 
useful  for  analysis  of  historical  data.  The  second 

 

•  Variety: The heterogeneity of data sources and data 
formats  in  big  data  systems  are  represented  by  the 
variety property of big data. Data sources for big data 
systems  vary  in  terms  of  sensory  and  non-sensory 
data  sources. 
the  structured  and 
unstructured data formats also increase variety in big 
data  systems.  Big  data  systems  handles  the  variety 
challenge

knowledge patterns 

In  addition, 

effectively 

•  Veracity:  The 

trustworthiness  of  big  data 

is 
represented  by  veracity  property  of  big  data.  This 
property is based on the authenticity of data sources 
and  correctness  of  data.  The  effective  handling  of 
veracity  property  of  big  data  improves  the  overall 
effectiveness of the system. 

to 

•  Variability:  The  handling  of  inconsistencies  in  big 
data is  attributed  with  variability.  The  variable  data 
rates  causes  computational  overhead  in  peak-load 
times  therefore  a  proper  handling  of  variability 
property increases the usefulness of big data systems. 
•  Value: The  interestingness  of  uncovered  knowledge 
patterns  is represented  by  the  value  property  of  big 
data systems. The value is directly affected by other 
5V’s 
(velocity,  volume,  variety,  veracity,  and 
variability)  therefore  a  proper  balance  between  all 
V’s  brings  more  value  in  the  big  data  system.  In 
addition,  the  effective  handling  of  all  other  V’s  is 
directly proportional to increased value of big data. 

3.1. Big Data Complexity 

Six  V’s  give  the  multi-dimensional  view  of  big  data 
hence increase data complexity in big data systems. Data 
engineers  are needed  to  handle  all  six  V’s  effectively  to 
increases the overall value of big data systems as well as 
handle  the  data  complexity.  To  handle  data  complexity, 
the  volumes  should  be  reduced  in  manageable  size  to 
effectively  and  properly  apply  knowledge  discovery 
algorithms.  The  velocity  should  be  managed  in  case  of 
online  data  analysis  so 
that  one-pass  data  streams 
algorithms could be applied effectively. The systems must 
be able to handle the data streams coming from multiple 
data sources in various formats so that information fusion 
algorithms  could  be  applied  effectively.  The  maximum 
and  complete  data  should  be  acquired  from  known  data 
sources to handle the veracity and systems must be able to 
adapt with varying data loads to handle variability of big 
data. Finally an overall balance between velocity, variety, 
volume,  variability  and  veracity  should  be  made  to 
harness the maximum value from big data.

•  Mobile Social Networks 

The  evolution  in  smart-cities  and  smart-government 
applications had created potential for participatory data 
sharing.  For  examples,  smart-city  big  data  systems 
collecting  commuters’  trajectories  to  predict  optimal 
traffic routes or get GPS locations for highly crowded 
public  places  for  better  traffic  and  law  and  order 
management. In this case, the local processing of user 
trajectories and just sending the travel time from point 
A  to  point  B  not  only  reduces  the  communication 
burden in local mobile devices  but also increases user 
privacy.

environments.

Another  key  application  areas  involving  participatory 
data  sharing  is  mobile  social  networks.  The  proposed 
strategy  helps 
and 
computational  burden  by  mining  users’  physical 
activities,  travel  patterns,  behaviors, moods,  and  other 
personal  patterns.  The  burden  of  processing  in  cloud 
environment  automatically  reduces  because  all  the 
patterns  are  discovered  in  users’  personal  sensing 
devices.  In addition,  users have  complete  control  over 
data  sharing  in  mobile  social  networks.  The  data 
patterns  shared in  MSNs  could  be  further analyzed  in 
big  data  systems  to  uncover  the  hidden  patterns  on 
community level.  

7. Conclusion 

The increasing number of V’s in big data introduces big 
data  complexity  which 
increases  computational  and 
communicational  burdens  in  big  data  environments.  In 
this  paper  we  proposed  a  pattern  based  data  sharing 
strategy  to  handle  the  increasing  data  complexity.  We 
discussed  existing  MDMS  and  the  workflow  of  our 
proposed strategy. We perceive that our proposed strategy 
could help to reduce the data complexity. In addition, the 
availability  of 
in  user 
environments  enhance  the  utility  of  big  data  systems  in 
communication-efficient way. In future, we will develop a 
model to effectively harness MDMS for data complexity 
reduction in big data environments.
