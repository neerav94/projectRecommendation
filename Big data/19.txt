ABSTRACT 
The concepts of Big Data have became intertwined with those of 
the  Internet  of  Things,  creating  mental  pictures  of  a  fully 
connected,  all-encompassing,  cyber-physical  world,  where  each 
and  every  object  will  contribute  with  information  to  a  “fully 
aware” society. Academic works are presenting this as the natural 
evolution  for  our  current  technologies.  The  panel  looks  at  these 
promises from the hard perspective of reality: what is being done, 
how much it cost, what needs to be developed, and what can be 
expected in the near and mid-term.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
The  development  of  sensor  networks,  coupled  with  increasingly 
low  power  sensors  and  actuators,  has  led  to  the  creation  of 
scenarios  where  the  physical  reality  is  being  measured  and 
reported  at  rates  which  can  be  considered  as  continuous  for 
practical  purposes.  All 
these  “things”,  are 
supposedly  exchanging  all  relevant  information,  acting  as  a 
mediator layer between the assessment of physical reality and the 
user. This Internet of Things allows the user to see its environment 
according to his/her specific preferences, with examples like “the 
fridge is warning that you are out of milk”. 
Such a level of knowledge, of understanding, is only possible by 
the  developments  on  automated  intelligence.  All  the  data 
presented by the sensors, must go through a huge set of actions, 
like synthesis, inference filtering, scoping, or clustering. With the 
need of intelligent processing for many sensors, it is of no surprise 
that techniques of Big Data become involved in this process. 

(re-)interpreted  and  studied  extensively 

It  is  thus  natural  that,  as  concepts,  Big  Data  and  IoT  have 
been  variously 
in 
academia, at least in the last decade, with very diverse proposals. 
For industry, however, these concepts have increasingly  become 
the reality. Data have emerged everywhere, and big data analytics 
often holds key to business opportunities. Devices of all sorts have 
also  flourished,  paving  way  for  a  full-connected  world.  Not 
surprisingly, the two concepts have become intertwined in  some 
sectors,  as  more  "things"  are  connected  to  the  Internet,  each 
generating  data  continuously.  This  panel  is  intended  to  bring 
together various industry sectors and academia to  discuss  where 
we stand and how coupled can these concepts become now and in 
the mid-term.

2.  QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER 
We  try  to  shine  some  light  on  the  point  where  we  are  in  the 
intersection  of  these  two  concepts,  what  can  be  achieved  in 
industry at this stage, and what is already felt as needed. Research 
questions that are  not  yet  answered  will  be  highlighted,  and  the 
challenges  on  how  to  transfer  existing  theoretical  work  into  our 
society. The questions tackled will consist of two different tracks: 
where we stand, and where we expect to go. 
 
2.1  Where we stand 
Looking into current industry, it is important to look at our status. 
Several different aspects will be addressed.  
• 

Is there already a global IoT industry? Can we consider that 
we have reached a maturity stage that any application vendor 
can  deploy  an  “intelligent  connectivity”  on  its  consumer 
devices? Are standards (both communication and electronics) 
at such a stage that smooth interoperation is to be expected? 
•  Are  we  prepared  for  the  communication  and  processing 
needs  for  this  Internet  of  Things?  Do  we  have  adequate 
architectures for processing data at the required rates, and do 
we have communication architectures which are adequate for 
the traffic patterns expected in IoT? Are standards up to these 
challenges? Do we have “intelligence processors” for our IoT 
world? 

•  Do we have an “Internet of Things” or an “Internet of Rich 
Things”? Can we replace existing physical devices with cost-
effective IoT-enable alternatives? Is it possible to show social 
benefits  (economic,  environment,  safety)  for  pushing  for 
such a conversion?  

•  Are there vertical sectors where this widespread usage is now 
easier  to  perform  than  others?  Which  areas  are  now 
intrinsically dependent of the merger of Big Data and IoT? 

•  Do we have a sustainable industry at this stage? What kind of 
actors  are  emerging?  Are  legacy  players  (operating  system 
manufacturers, 
engines, 

operators, 

telecom 

search 

 

distribution  companies) 
taking  over  all  new  business 
functions,  or  can  we  see  independent  SMEs  increasingly 
relevant? 

 

2.2  Where do we expect to go 
The second line of discussion inside the panel will  look  into  the 
future,  and  how  our  society  will  react  to  (and  impact)  this 
revolution. 

 

•  What  challenges  do  we  perceive  for  the  future?  Are  these 
mostly technical or fundamentally of economical nature? Do 
we  envisage  scalable  techniques  for  data  processing?  Are 
communications able to cope with how many sensors?  

•  What power limitations do we envisage? Do we see realizable 
power  budgets  for  the  sensors?  Do  we  need  novel  (self) 
power  techniques?  Are  we  requiring  an  increasingly  large 
piece of world power?  

• 

•  Will markets be transformed by Big Data usage over widely 
deployed  IoT?  For  an  aging  society,  do  we  seen  IoT  as  a 
piece  on  elderly  care?  Can  we  trust  these  techniques  for 
health applications, or are they limited to active aging? 
Legal  issues  are  clear?  How  can  these  impair  worldwide 
developments? How can we have a global framework for data 
acquisition,  storage  and  processing,  with  all  the  different 
ethical, cultural and legal frameworks across the world? Will 
ownership of data and information become  as  important  as 
ownership of the device? Are there privacy issues to consider? 
Will the user accept such an intrusive society? Can we expect 
technology to help in these matters? 

•  How  can  we  establish  a  proper  market  for  the  whole 
connected  society?  Can  the  user  remain  in  control  of  its 
information (and its devices)? Is the IoT society ownerless? 
Will value pass from data to algorithms? 

•  What does industry need from academia? Cost reductions or 

technology performance developments?
