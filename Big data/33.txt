Figure 2. Generic reference architecture for big service. This architecture has three main layers (local services, domain-oriented 
services, and demand-oriented service solutions) and two additional layers (the cloud infrastructure at the bottom and the client 
business at the top). IaaS, Internet as a service; PaaS, platform as a service; SaaS, software as a service.

BIG SERVICE REFERENCE 
ARCHITECTURE
A  generic  reference  architecture  for 
big  service  is  depicted  in  Figure  2. 
Such  an  architecture  can  be  orga-
nized  into  three  main  layers:  local 
services, 
 domain-oriented  services, 
and  demand- oriented  services.  The 
reference  architecture  also  contains 
two additional layers: the cloud infra-
structure at the bottom and the client 
business at the top.

Local services layer
Most  services  are  generated,  owned, 
and  shared  by  individuals  and  orga-
nizations.  Some  are  atomic  services 
(also  called  elementary  services  that 
do not rely on other services) that are 
virtualized  from  physical  services  or 
the  IoT.  Others  are  complex  services 
offered through service composition. 
In  the  local  services  layer,  the  basic 
service  infrastructure  and  resources 
are packaged into services using ser-
vice encapsulation and virtualization 
(for  example,  cloud  services).  The 
atomic  and  composite  services  can 
be  connected  or  integrated  through 

82 

C O M P U T E R      

service chains and then run on cloud 
platforms. 

Domain-oriented services layer
In this layer, aggregated local services 
converge  into  more  powerful  com-
posite  services  according  to  the  do-
main-oriented business demands and 
actual  businesses  relationships.  The 
typical  format  of  this  layer  can  be  a 
big domain-oriented services network 
(such  as  the  IoS).  There  are  many  do-
main-oriented  service  communities 
in which the composite services come 
from one domain or multiple domains. 
Composite  services  and  service  net-
works  link  together  through  high-
level  service  chains,  which  are  also 
called  service  hyperchains.  Through 
service  convergence  across  multiple 
organizations,  domains,  networks, 
and cyber-physical worlds, more com-
plex service communities will exist in 
the cloud and big data environments.

Demand-oriented services layer
Customer  requirements  in  big  service 
are  mass  individualized  or  extremely 
diverse,  and  the  service  solutions  are 

customer oriented and value driven be-
cause of mass individualization. Match-
ing  reliable  demand-oriented  services 
with  the  customer  requirements  is 
an  important  factor  in  this  layer,  as 
it’s  highly  tuned  to  the  satisfaction  of 
and  value  creation  for  the  big  service 
customer.

Other layers
The infrastructure layer at the bottom 
underpins  the  big  service  environ-
ment constituted by cloud computing 
platforms,  services,  and  other  basic 
resources such as computing, human, 
and physical. The key elements at the 
client layer are the customers’ experi-
ences and requirements. To analyze a 
customer’s  functional  and  nonfunc-
tional  requirements,  service  require-
ments  engineering  and  service  ergo-
nomics  need  to  be  developed  further 
by the community.

plinary field that requires the support

Figure 2. Generic reference architecture for big service. This architecture has three main layers (local services, domain-oriented 
services, and demand-oriented service solutions) and two additional layers (the cloud infrastructure at the bottom and the client 
business at the top). IaaS, Internet as a service; PaaS, platform as a service; SaaS, software as a service.

BIG SERVICE REFERENCE 
ARCHITECTURE
A  generic  reference  architecture  for 
big  service  is  depicted  in  Figure  2. 
Such  an  architecture  can  be  orga-
nized  into  three  main  layers:  local 
services, 
 domain-oriented  services, 
and  demand- oriented  services.  The 
reference  architecture  also  contains 
two additional layers: the cloud infra-
structure at the bottom and the client 
business at the top.

Local services layer
Most  services  are  generated,  owned, 
and  shared  by  individuals  and  orga-
nizations.  Some  are  atomic  services 
(also  called  elementary  services  that 
do not rely on other services) that are 
virtualized  from  physical  services  or 
the  IoT.  Others  are  complex  services 
offered through service composition. 
In  the  local  services  layer,  the  basic 
service  infrastructure  and  resources 
are packaged into services using ser-
vice encapsulation and virtualization 
(for  example,  cloud  services).  The 
atomic  and  composite  services  can 
be  connected  or  integrated  through

service chains and then run on cloud 
platforms. 

Domain-oriented services layer
In this layer, aggregated local services 
converge  into  more  powerful  com-
posite  services  according  to  the  do-
main-oriented business demands and 
actual  businesses  relationships.  The 
typical  format  of  this  layer  can  be  a 
big domain-oriented services network 
(such  as  the  IoS).  There  are  many  do-
main-oriented  service  communities 
in which the composite services come 
from one domain or multiple domains. 
Composite  services  and  service  net-
works  link  together  through  high-
level  service  chains,  which  are  also 
called  service  hyperchains.  Through 
service  convergence  across  multiple 
organizations,  domains,  networks, 
and cyber-physical worlds, more com-
plex service communities will exist in 
the cloud and big data environments.

Demand-oriented services layer
Customer  requirements  in  big  service 
are  mass  individualized  or  extremely 
diverse,  and  the  service  solutions  are 

customer oriented and value driven be-
cause of mass individualization. Match-
ing  reliable  demand-oriented  services 
with  the  customer  requirements  is 
an  important  factor  in  this  layer,  as 
it’s  highly  tuned  to  the  satisfaction  of 
and  value  creation  for  the  big  service 
customer.

Other layers
The infrastructure layer at the bottom 
underpins  the  big  service  environ-
ment constituted by cloud computing 
platforms,  services,  and  other  basic 
resources such as computing, human, 
and physical. The key elements at the 
client layer are the customers’ experi-
ences and requirements. To analyze a 
customer’s  functional  and  nonfunc-
tional  requirements,  service  require-
ments  engineering  and  service  ergo-
nomics  need  to  be  developed  further 
by the community.

BIG SERVICE  
RESEARCH TOPICS
Big service is an emerging, interdisci-
plinary field that requires the support 
of  many  technologies,  such  as  cloud

ment, big data, the IoT, software engi-
neering,  service  computing,  and  data 
mining.  To  fully  realize  the  potential 
of  big  service,  however,  further  re-
search and development are needed in 
at least eight challenging areas.

System  architecture.  Big  service  is 
a  complicated  ecosystem  with  many 
diverse  services  that  can  cross  multi-
ple  domains  and  networks  as  well  as 
both  the  physical  and  virtual  worlds. 
A carefully designed system architec-
ture  and  reference  model  is  needed 
to  effectively  establish  the  principles, 
structure,  and  configuration  of  a  big 
service ecosystem.

Complex  service  modeling  and  repre-
sentation.  Despite  extensive  research 
on  service  modeling  and  representa-
tion,  it’s  still  a  challenge  for  big  ser-
vice due to its unique characteristics. 
Models  for  complex  services,  service 
requirements,  service  behaviors,  and 
service semantics should be adapted to 
the  integration,  interoperability,  con-
vergence, and coordination of service 
communities.  Furthermore,  since  big 
service is a complex and evolving ser-
vice ecosystem, modeling and quanti-
fying its evolution patterns can help us 
to better understand it.

New service engineering and methodol-
ogy  paradigm.  A  new  paradigm  of  soft-
ware service engineering and methodol-
ogy, which is different from traditional 
software  engineering  approaches,  is 
needed for big service. In this new par-
adigm,  service- oriented  requirements 
engineering  and  domain- related  ser-
vice engineering can be simultaneously 
developed.  Accumulating  well-pre-
pared,  reusable  service  resources  for 
service convergence therefore becomes 
a meaningful task. Matching converged 
service solutions with customer require-
ment  propositions  is  a  key  issue  that 
needs active research.

Service  convergence  and  collabora-
tion.  In  big  service,  models  and  ap-
proaches  for  how  services  are  being 
composed  across  different  domains, 
various  networks,  and  the  cyber- 
physical  world  should  be  developed. 

 

The domain-oriented services commu-
nity  is  an  important  layer  for  service 
convergence,  and  the  service  chain 
is  an  important  approach  for  com-
posing  the  smaller-grained  services 
from multiple sources into composite 
services.

Service value model and transforma-
tion. Service value models, value net-
works,  and  service  value  annotation 
should be extensively researched and 
developed.  To  transfer  value  factors 
into the services life cycle, the value- 
oriented  or  value-aware  service  en-
gineering  methodologies  need  to  be 
applied.

Context-aware  service  constitution 
and  delivery.  Future  service  systems 
will  offer  more  customized  service 
solutions to meet individual customer 
requirements.  To  eliminate  the  gap 
between  diverse  individual  customer 
requirements  and  the  massive  num-
ber of services in big service, context- 
aware service models will play a criti-
cal role. The semantic information of 
context should deal with not only the 
environment- related  information  but 
also the user-oriented knowledge.

Service intelligence and recommenda-
tion. Service intelligence in big service 
is  similar  to  business  intelligence  in 
e-business, and it will become an im-
portant  research  area  as  big  service 
grows.  However,  service  intelligence 
is  much  more  complicated  due  to  the 
dynamics and complexities of the ser-
vices themselves and the relationships 
among them.

Dependability,  credibility,  and  trust-
worthiness.  Services  are  increasingly 
being  used  in  complicated  mission- 
critical and business applications. Con-
sequently,  the  dependability,  reliabil-
ity, credibility, trustworthiness, safety, 
security, and quality of big service will 
become critical issues and need exten-
sive research and development.

B ig  service  reflects  a  natural 

evolution 
the  merg-
ing  of  cloud  computing,  the 
IoT,  the  IoS,  and  social  networks. 

from 

Through  integration  of  the  virtual 
and physical worlds and linking ser-
vices  across  multiple  domains  and 
networks, big service will greatly in-
fluence service science, information 
technology, industrial business, and 
other  fields  as  it  yields  tremendous 
benefits to society.
