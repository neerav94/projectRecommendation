Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko,

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and

of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These

systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies,

certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and

O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by 

1 http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-bookmarking-websites (retrieved 10.09.2012).

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1other users. All bookmarks posted to Delicious are publicly viewable by default. Tagging in 
systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by 

1 http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-bookmarking-websites (retrieved 10.09.2012).

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1other users. All bookmarks posted to Delicious are publicly viewable by default. Tagging in 
systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by 

1 http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-bookmarking-websites (retrieved 10.09.2012).

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1other users. All bookmarks posted to Delicious are publicly viewable by default. Tagging in 
systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

10

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1other users. All bookmarks posted to Delicious are publicly viewable by default. Tagging in 
systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

10

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Figure 2. data collection Procedure

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by 

1 http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-bookmarking-websites (retrieved 10.09.2012).

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1other users. All bookmarks posted to Delicious are publicly viewable by default. Tagging in 
systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

5

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

Most important Users and URLs are placed in the middle of the Figure 3, where density 
of connections is higher.  Figure 4 shows the degree of variability in the website and user

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

14

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

Most important Users and URLs are placed in the middle of the Figure 3, where density 
of connections is higher.  Figure 4 shows the degree of variability in the website and user

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

Table 2 shows the 10 most centralized websites, and we can see that nine are media-
based (online newspapers such as The New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, Washington 
Post, Financial Times, Reason, The Nation, Spiegel and The Economist).

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

After  this  brief  description,  we  want  to  clarify  that  these  are  not  the  unique  results 
that  could  have  been  exposed  here,  after  the  complex  process  described  for  the  retrieval 
of information. We have chosen them as good examples that give sense to the operation 
of crawling big data, as first points of departure for knowing a bit more about the topic of 
globalization of agriculture, and for demonstrating the way that people describe and share

section, a discussion about the results will be presented in order to know more about some 
alternative analyses, reflections, etc.

5. dIscussIon 
5.1. centrality and Power
Hanneman (2005) reminds us: “a very simple, but often very effective measure of an actor’s 
centrality and power potential is their degree”. In our case, as indegree concern URLs and as 
these represent some kind of collective actor, the determination of centrality measures make 
sense. Higher indegrees mean that the URLs are chosen by more users (they received more 
links). It is evident that the New York Times, in this network of globalization of agriculture 
in Delicious, greatly surpasses other URLs (with 1,203 inbound links, followed by the BBC 
website with 674 links). Most cited, recommended, or considered websites with regards to 
a topic occupy a central place and have an important role in the process of dissemination of 
news, events, trending topics, ideology, culture, etc. Knowing this previously hidden hierarchy 
is also very useful for different socioeconomic reasons. At the same time, this identification 
of key collective actors (represented here through URLs) allows a better comprehension of 
leadership, influence process, and power-related structures. For social practitioners, it is a 
good way to identify key informants in a community through whom disseminating useful 
and important information occurs.

Indegree in Table 2 also shows a very unequal distribution of power of the URLs cited by 
users in the topic of globalization of agriculture, represented by an important accumulation 
of inlinks.  Only 10 URLs represent an important, accumulated indegree). 

Regarding other actors in the networks, the users, for the identification of key actors 
that  disseminate  and  share  URLs,  as  the  previously  cited  Mritiunjoy,  it  is  important  to 
determine  from  where  key  elements  that  structure  the  network  emerge.  Is  it  possible  to 
explain why ‘that’ greatly important actor is in the network of globalization of agriculture? 
Key  actors  in  this  type  of  network  could  configure  and  reconfigure  the  evolution  of  the 
network, structure, and even manipulate the type of interchange of resources in Delicious or 
in similar bookmarking sites. 

Their prominence has something to say to social researchers, practitioners, etc.  Is it by 
chance? Are most prominent actors in the type of website like Delicious corresponding to a 
profile of very active and participative people? Do they usually work (or have as a hobby) in 
this area, which could explain the accumulation and tagging of so many URLs in Delicious? 
These and other questions could be answered in further steps of the research, depending on 
the concrete goals at each moment.

5.2. central tags: users producing tags
In the process of linking URLs in Delicious, the majority of users selected tags suggested 
by the website or added new tags in a creative way for describing or qualifying the URLs 
that they were recommended. A ‘tag cloud’ was built in order to have a visual approach to 
the language that was employed by users in their descriptions. As we have focused on the 
retrieval of information regarding the topic of globalization of agriculture, the question now 
is to wonder what we could know about this topic through the extracted tags. From a total 
of 1,700 tags, two words were the main ones, as most cited when users labelled URLs. It 
is important to note that each user could label a URL with an unlimited number of tags 
(average 12 tags per user, max 433 and min 2).  The most frequently used tags were the 
words: ‘economics’ (350 citations out of 1,700 tags, 20.6%) and ‘environment’ (273, 16%).

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by 

1 http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-bookmarking-websites (retrieved 10.09.2012).

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1other users. All bookmarks posted to Delicious are publicly viewable by default. Tagging in 
systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

5

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies,

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

10

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

Most important Users and URLs are placed in the middle of the Figure 3, where density

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

Table 2 shows the 10 most centralized websites, and we can see that nine are media-
based (online newspapers such as The New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, Washington 
Post, Financial Times, Reason, The Nation, Spiegel and The Economist).

14

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

After  this  brief  description,  we  want  to  clarify  that  these  are  not  the  unique  results 
that  could  have  been  exposed  here,  after  the  complex  process  described  for  the  retrieval 
of information. We have chosen them as good examples that give sense to the operation 
of crawling big data, as first points of departure for knowing a bit more about the topic of 
globalization of agriculture, and for demonstrating the way that people describe and share 

15

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchwebsites about this issue through a modern and collaborative process of tagging. In the next 
section, a discussion about the results will be presented in order to know more about some 
alternative analyses, reflections, etc.

5. dIscussIon 
5.1. centrality and Power
Hanneman (2005) reminds us: “a very simple, but often very effective measure of an actor’s 
centrality and power potential is their degree”. In our case, as indegree concern URLs and as 
these represent some kind of collective actor, the determination of centrality measures make 
sense. Higher indegrees mean that the URLs are chosen by more users (they received more 
links). It is evident that the New York Times, in this network of globalization of agriculture 
in Delicious, greatly surpasses other URLs (with 1,203 inbound links, followed by the BBC 
website with 674 links). Most cited, recommended, or considered websites with regards to 
a topic occupy a central place and have an important role in the process of dissemination of 
news, events, trending topics, ideology, culture, etc. Knowing this previously hidden hierarchy 
is also very useful for different socioeconomic reasons. At the same time, this identification 
of key collective actors (represented here through URLs) allows a better comprehension of 
leadership, influence process, and power-related structures. For social practitioners, it is a 
good way to identify key informants in a community through whom disseminating useful 
and important information occurs.

Indegree in Table 2 also shows a very unequal distribution of power of the URLs cited by 
users in the topic of globalization of agriculture, represented by an important accumulation 
of inlinks.  Only 10 URLs represent an important, accumulated indegree). 

Regarding other actors in the networks, the users, for the identification of key actors 
that  disseminate  and  share  URLs,  as  the  previously  cited  Mritiunjoy,  it  is  important  to 
determine  from  where  key  elements  that  structure  the  network  emerge.  Is  it  possible  to 
explain why ‘that’ greatly important actor is in the network of globalization of agriculture? 
Key  actors  in  this  type  of  network  could  configure  and  reconfigure  the  evolution  of  the 
network, structure, and even manipulate the type of interchange of resources in Delicious or 
in similar bookmarking sites. 

Their prominence has something to say to social researchers, practitioners, etc.  Is it by 
chance? Are most prominent actors in the type of website like Delicious corresponding to a 
profile of very active and participative people? Do they usually work (or have as a hobby) in 
this area, which could explain the accumulation and tagging of so many URLs in Delicious? 
These and other questions could be answered in further steps of the research, depending on 
the concrete goals at each moment.

5.2. central tags: users producing tags
In the process of linking URLs in Delicious, the majority of users selected tags suggested 
by the website or added new tags in a creative way for describing or qualifying the URLs 
that they were recommended. A ‘tag cloud’ was built in order to have a visual approach to 
the language that was employed by users in their descriptions. As we have focused on the 
retrieval of information regarding the topic of globalization of agriculture, the question now 
is to wonder what we could know about this topic through the extracted tags. From a total 
of 1,700 tags, two words were the main ones, as most cited when users labelled URLs. It 
is important to note that each user could label a URL with an unlimited number of tags 
(average 12 tags per user, max 433 and min 2).  The most frequently used tags were the 
words: ‘economics’ (350 citations out of 1,700 tags, 20.6%) and ‘environment’ (273, 16%). 

16

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Other, very frequent tags were: sustainability (153), politics (152), economy (144), trade 
(131), business (99), poverty (97), culture (84), farming (84), africa (83), health (78), and 
development (76); in relative terms, these 13 tags represent one out of four labelled tags 
surrounding the topic (25.9%).

Discovering the importance of these words make us wonder not only of the reasons for 
the prominence of the first two tags regarding the globalization of agriculture but also for the 
rest. In addition, as 1,700 tags were also found qualifying and describing webpages regarding 
the topic of globalization of agriculture, some analyses are possible to know if some tags are 
used on an interchangeable basis, considered as synonyms, as was reported as one of the 
problems of collaborative tagging or the suggested vague-meaning problem (Kroski, 2005; 
Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007).

The same thing could be done regarding ‘term variations’. For instance, economy and 
economics are two important words in the topic of globalization of agriculture. Are these 
tags used in a similar or equivalent way at tagging? Why is the word economics sometimes 
used, and why, at other times, is economy used? Are they used in the same way at classifying 
the URLs?  

By limiting the analysis to a particular period of time, tags could be associated to the use of 
language at a particular moment. They could even be a good representation of the ideological 
and terminological approach to the topic in the international arena, at that moment, and 
be  useful  for  the  study  of  the  evolution  and  usage  of  language  in  a  topic  over  time.  On 
the other hand, the use of some tags at classifying URLs connected to the globalization of 
agriculture, and the distinction among users in the way they use some words as labels, could 
yield other types of results. Are scientific users  utilizing the same tags as other professionals 
or general users? Perhaps different scientists or other users produce different labels around 
the same topic. Perhaps the first people tagging a topic are influencing the following tags 
that are incorporated in Delicious, etc. Nevertheless, some of this analysis can be limited by 
the information available from users. Other possible studies, going into more depth, may 
retrieve the pages that were labelled and undertake a content analysis to determine what 
kind of content is labelled through concrete tags. This is a cognitive way to see how users 
summarize  and  represent  in  short  and  definite  words  what  could  be  broad  and  detailed 
content. It could be a way to see keywords that remind them about something. Through 
this, different applications could be suggested (for instance, in advertising, mobilizing, etc.). 
Although this article has been more focused on the retrieval and illustration aspects, we 
have not shown networks of tags linked by users or by URLs tagged by users; a complementary, 
detailed  analysis  could  help  to  identify  users  that  have  the  same  patterns  at  tagging  or 
URLs that were similarly labelled. This opens a door to study structural equivalences and 
considering, for instance, applications for particular types of users. 

Other  questions  emerge,  as  to  why  some  labels  are  present  but  not  others?  Is  it  a 
question  of  language  usage?  Is  it  a  question  of  traditions  at  tagging  in  Web  2.0?  Is  it  a 
fashion? Supposedly, if people use Delicious for collaborative reasons, tags must at least be 
understandable for other users, unless the user prioritizes their own usage of Delicious.

Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by 

1 http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-bookmarking-websites (retrieved 10.09.2012).

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1other users. All bookmarks posted to Delicious are publicly viewable by default. Tagging in 
systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

Most important Users and URLs are placed in the middle of the Figure 3, where density 
of connections is higher.  Figure 4 shows the degree of variability in the website and user

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

Table 2 shows the 10 most centralized websites, and we can see that nine are media-
based (online newspapers such as The New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, Washington 
Post, Financial Times, Reason, The Nation, Spiegel and The Economist).

11 These ten Users got 1,436 outbound links from a total of 10,219.

14

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

After  this  brief  description,  we  want  to  clarify  that  these  are  not  the  unique  results 
that  could  have  been  exposed  here,  after  the  complex  process  described  for  the  retrieval 
of information. We have chosen them as good examples that give sense to the operation 
of crawling big data, as first points of departure for knowing a bit more about the topic of 
globalization of agriculture, and for demonstrating the way that people describe and share 

15

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchwebsites about this issue through a modern and collaborative process of tagging. In the next 
section, a discussion about the results will be presented in order to know more about some 
alternative analyses, reflections, etc.

5. dIscussIon 
5.1. centrality and Power
Hanneman (2005) reminds us: “a very simple, but often very effective measure of an actor’s 
centrality and power potential is their degree”. In our case, as indegree concern URLs and as 
these represent some kind of collective actor, the determination of centrality measures make 
sense. Higher indegrees mean that the URLs are chosen by more users (they received more 
links). It is evident that the New York Times, in this network of globalization of agriculture 
in Delicious, greatly surpasses other URLs (with 1,203 inbound links, followed by the BBC 
website with 674 links). Most cited, recommended, or considered websites with regards to 
a topic occupy a central place and have an important role in the process of dissemination of 
news, events, trending topics, ideology, culture, etc. Knowing this previously hidden hierarchy 
is also very useful for different socioeconomic reasons. At the same time, this identification 
of key collective actors (represented here through URLs) allows a better comprehension of 
leadership, influence process, and power-related structures. For social practitioners, it is a 
good way to identify key informants in a community through whom disseminating useful 
and important information occurs.

Indegree in Table 2 also shows a very unequal distribution of power of the URLs cited by 
users in the topic of globalization of agriculture, represented by an important accumulation 
of inlinks.  Only 10 URLs represent an important, accumulated indegree). 

Regarding other actors in the networks, the users, for the identification of key actors 
that  disseminate  and  share  URLs,  as  the  previously  cited  Mritiunjoy,  it  is  important  to 
determine  from  where  key  elements  that  structure  the  network  emerge.  Is  it  possible  to 
explain why ‘that’ greatly important actor is in the network of globalization of agriculture? 
Key  actors  in  this  type  of  network  could  configure  and  reconfigure  the  evolution  of  the 
network, structure, and even manipulate the type of interchange of resources in Delicious or 
in similar bookmarking sites. 

Their prominence has something to say to social researchers, practitioners, etc.  Is it by 
chance? Are most prominent actors in the type of website like Delicious corresponding to a 
profile of very active and participative people? Do they usually work (or have as a hobby) in 
this area, which could explain the accumulation and tagging of so many URLs in Delicious? 
These and other questions could be answered in further steps of the research, depending on 
the concrete goals at each moment.

5.2. central tags: users producing tags
In the process of linking URLs in Delicious, the majority of users selected tags suggested 
by the website or added new tags in a creative way for describing or qualifying the URLs 
that they were recommended. A ‘tag cloud’ was built in order to have a visual approach to 
the language that was employed by users in their descriptions. As we have focused on the 
retrieval of information regarding the topic of globalization of agriculture, the question now 
is to wonder what we could know about this topic through the extracted tags. From a total 
of 1,700 tags, two words were the main ones, as most cited when users labelled URLs. It 
is important to note that each user could label a URL with an unlimited number of tags 
(average 12 tags per user, max 433 and min 2).  The most frequently used tags were the 
words: ‘economics’ (350 citations out of 1,700 tags, 20.6%) and ‘environment’ (273, 16%). 

16

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Other, very frequent tags were: sustainability (153), politics (152), economy (144), trade 
(131), business (99), poverty (97), culture (84), farming (84), africa (83), health (78), and 
development (76); in relative terms, these 13 tags represent one out of four labelled tags 
surrounding the topic (25.9%).

Discovering the importance of these words make us wonder not only of the reasons for 
the prominence of the first two tags regarding the globalization of agriculture but also for the 
rest. In addition, as 1,700 tags were also found qualifying and describing webpages regarding 
the topic of globalization of agriculture, some analyses are possible to know if some tags are 
used on an interchangeable basis, considered as synonyms, as was reported as one of the 
problems of collaborative tagging or the suggested vague-meaning problem (Kroski, 2005; 
Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007).

The same thing could be done regarding ‘term variations’. For instance, economy and 
economics are two important words in the topic of globalization of agriculture. Are these 
tags used in a similar or equivalent way at tagging? Why is the word economics sometimes 
used, and why, at other times, is economy used? Are they used in the same way at classifying 
the URLs?  

By limiting the analysis to a particular period of time, tags could be associated to the use of 
language at a particular moment. They could even be a good representation of the ideological 
and terminological approach to the topic in the international arena, at that moment, and 
be  useful  for  the  study  of  the  evolution  and  usage  of  language  in  a  topic  over  time.  On 
the other hand, the use of some tags at classifying URLs connected to the globalization of 
agriculture, and the distinction among users in the way they use some words as labels, could 
yield other types of results. Are scientific users  utilizing the same tags as other professionals 
or general users? Perhaps different scientists or other users produce different labels around 
the same topic. Perhaps the first people tagging a topic are influencing the following tags 
that are incorporated in Delicious, etc. Nevertheless, some of this analysis can be limited by 
the information available from users. Other possible studies, going into more depth, may 
retrieve the pages that were labelled and undertake a content analysis to determine what 
kind of content is labelled through concrete tags. This is a cognitive way to see how users 
summarize  and  represent  in  short  and  definite  words  what  could  be  broad  and  detailed 
content. It could be a way to see keywords that remind them about something. Through 
this, different applications could be suggested (for instance, in advertising, mobilizing, etc.). 
Although this article has been more focused on the retrieval and illustration aspects, we 
have not shown networks of tags linked by users or by URLs tagged by users; a complementary, 
detailed  analysis  could  help  to  identify  users  that  have  the  same  patterns  at  tagging  or 
URLs that were similarly labelled. This opens a door to study structural equivalences and 
considering, for instance, applications for particular types of users. 

Other  questions  emerge,  as  to  why  some  labels  are  present  but  not  others?  Is  it  a 
question  of  language  usage?  Is  it  a  question  of  traditions  at  tagging  in  Web  2.0?  Is  it  a 
fashion? Supposedly, if people use Delicious for collaborative reasons, tags must at least be 
understandable for other users, unless the user prioritizes their own usage of Delicious.

6. concLusIons And Future reseArch
The main objective of this paper was presenting a methodology to use big data from Web 
2.0 in social research. We had an interest in illustrating the extraction of data from a social 
bookmarking site (Delicious) and showing the type of results that this type of analysis could 
offer to social scientists. As it concerned big series of data crawled from a large social tagging 

17

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchsystem, the analysis could have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, 
which form the basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors. 

Our approach represents an important first step towards the development of empirical 
techniques  capable  of  automatically  differentiating  groups  of  individuals  with  common 
interests, and individuals who occupy a more central position. This research is also of interest 
to make recommendations on the knowledge base of individual interests.

In addition, our analysis offers a previously unavailable understanding in the definition 
of recommendation services. To be able to identify a short list of the most centralized users 
and ties is extremely useful for researchers attempting to understand a community of more 
than a thousand links. This is particularly important for researchers interested in formulating 
strategies  for  intervention  and  mobilization,  but  practitioners  and  companies  could  also 
make  use  of  this.  The  discovery  of  the  central  elements  in  a  network  (users  and  URLs) 
and the tags employed by users could be a key to the design of future strategies for the 
dissemination of messages, while also helping to achieve more success in communications, 
such as making use of important keywords to attract greater attention, etc. At the same 
time, if we know other interests of the users belonging to a network - through, for instance, 
other webpages that they link, and others tags that they label - we would be able to make 
recommendations, as done by other systems such as Amazon. 

With regards to the process of retrieval of information, the method presented here was 
somewhat complex but easy to apply if there is some computer knowledge. Nevertheless, 
working in interdisciplinary teams could greatly help to develop this kind of knowledge, as 
it was in our case. Though the technical process described was successful, improvements are 
necessary in the future, at least regarding the retrieval methods and the implementation of 
IR and RS techniques in social commerce and social media contexts.

On the other hand, the relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by 
traditional Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, 
and  tags,  which  is  more  complex  to  manage.  This  article  has  laid  the  first  stone  in  the 
difficult process of understanding and discovering patterns in the process that characterizes 
users  tagging  URLs  for  collaborative  reasons.  The  application  was  made  under  the  topic 
‘globalization of agriculture’.

Some of the first contributions in the area of globalization of agriculture were that tags 
used to describe URLs in the Delicious’s social bookmarking site were mostly concentrated 
around a few terms.  The approximation to this topic in the future through other bookmarking 
sites (for instance, dominated by Spanish-speaking users) will allow the researchers to know 
if the recommended URLs are again media-based or are even the same webpages; or, for 
instance, if there is a semantic change concerning tags used for describing and classifying 
URLs.

Lastly, we do not want to close the article without clarifying that researching the topic 
of globalization of agriculture in a systematic and broad way may require the consideration 
of other starting points for the retrieval of information, at least to compare and contrast 
results. This is a limitation of this work. Nevertheless, the search yielded 1,700 different tags 
that have been used in the period of only a month to qualify and describe the phenomenon. 
It is a large number of tags, but we found a great concentration of them, as the centrality 
measure  showed.  The  same  argument  could  be  made  regarding  URLs,  in  that  they  were 
extremely concentrated in mass media. Of course, other analysis in the future could be made 
with a longer period of time, along with other explorations. This is only a beginning.

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1other users. All bookmarks posted to Delicious are publicly viewable by default. Tagging in 
systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

10

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

Most important Users and URLs are placed in the middle of the Figure 3, where density 
of connections is higher.  Figure 4 shows the degree of variability in the website and user

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

Table 2 shows the 10 most centralized websites, and we can see that nine are media-
based (online newspapers such as The New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, Washington 
Post, Financial Times, Reason, The Nation, Spiegel and The Economist).

11 These ten Users got 1,436 outbound links from a total of 10,219.

14

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

After  this  brief  description,  we  want  to  clarify  that  these  are  not  the  unique  results 
that  could  have  been  exposed  here,  after  the  complex  process  described  for  the  retrieval 
of information. We have chosen them as good examples that give sense to the operation 
of crawling big data, as first points of departure for knowing a bit more about the topic of 
globalization of agriculture, and for demonstrating the way that people describe and share 

15

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchwebsites about this issue through a modern and collaborative process of tagging. In the next 
section, a discussion about the results will be presented in order to know more about some 
alternative analyses, reflections, etc.

5. dIscussIon 
5.1. centrality and Power
Hanneman (2005) reminds us: “a very simple, but often very effective measure of an actor’s 
centrality and power potential is their degree”. In our case, as indegree concern URLs and as 
these represent some kind of collective actor, the determination of centrality measures make 
sense. Higher indegrees mean that the URLs are chosen by more users (they received more 
links). It is evident that the New York Times, in this network of globalization of agriculture 
in Delicious, greatly surpasses other URLs (with 1,203 inbound links, followed by the BBC 
website with 674 links). Most cited, recommended, or considered websites with regards to 
a topic occupy a central place and have an important role in the process of dissemination of 
news, events, trending topics, ideology, culture, etc. Knowing this previously hidden hierarchy 
is also very useful for different socioeconomic reasons. At the same time, this identification 
of key collective actors (represented here through URLs) allows a better comprehension of 
leadership, influence process, and power-related structures. For social practitioners, it is a 
good way to identify key informants in a community through whom disseminating useful 
and important information occurs.

Indegree in Table 2 also shows a very unequal distribution of power of the URLs cited by 
users in the topic of globalization of agriculture, represented by an important accumulation 
of inlinks.  Only 10 URLs represent an important, accumulated indegree). 

Regarding other actors in the networks, the users, for the identification of key actors 
that  disseminate  and  share  URLs,  as  the  previously  cited  Mritiunjoy,  it  is  important  to 
determine  from  where  key  elements  that  structure  the  network  emerge.  Is  it  possible  to 
explain why ‘that’ greatly important actor is in the network of globalization of agriculture? 
Key  actors  in  this  type  of  network  could  configure  and  reconfigure  the  evolution  of  the 
network, structure, and even manipulate the type of interchange of resources in Delicious or 
in similar bookmarking sites. 

Their prominence has something to say to social researchers, practitioners, etc.  Is it by 
chance? Are most prominent actors in the type of website like Delicious corresponding to a 
profile of very active and participative people? Do they usually work (or have as a hobby) in 
this area, which could explain the accumulation and tagging of so many URLs in Delicious? 
These and other questions could be answered in further steps of the research, depending on 
the concrete goals at each moment.

5.2. central tags: users producing tags
In the process of linking URLs in Delicious, the majority of users selected tags suggested 
by the website or added new tags in a creative way for describing or qualifying the URLs 
that they were recommended. A ‘tag cloud’ was built in order to have a visual approach to 
the language that was employed by users in their descriptions. As we have focused on the 
retrieval of information regarding the topic of globalization of agriculture, the question now 
is to wonder what we could know about this topic through the extracted tags. From a total 
of 1,700 tags, two words were the main ones, as most cited when users labelled URLs. It 
is important to note that each user could label a URL with an unlimited number of tags 
(average 12 tags per user, max 433 and min 2).  The most frequently used tags were the 
words: ‘economics’ (350 citations out of 1,700 tags, 20.6%) and ‘environment’ (273, 16%). 

16

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Other, very frequent tags were: sustainability (153), politics (152), economy (144), trade 
(131), business (99), poverty (97), culture (84), farming (84), africa (83), health (78), and 
development (76); in relative terms, these 13 tags represent one out of four labelled tags 
surrounding the topic (25.9%).

Discovering the importance of these words make us wonder not only of the reasons for 
the prominence of the first two tags regarding the globalization of agriculture but also for the 
rest. In addition, as 1,700 tags were also found qualifying and describing webpages regarding 
the topic of globalization of agriculture, some analyses are possible to know if some tags are 
used on an interchangeable basis, considered as synonyms, as was reported as one of the 
problems of collaborative tagging or the suggested vague-meaning problem (Kroski, 2005; 
Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007).

The same thing could be done regarding ‘term variations’. For instance, economy and 
economics are two important words in the topic of globalization of agriculture. Are these 
tags used in a similar or equivalent way at tagging? Why is the word economics sometimes 
used, and why, at other times, is economy used? Are they used in the same way at classifying 
the URLs?  

By limiting the analysis to a particular period of time, tags could be associated to the use of 
language at a particular moment. They could even be a good representation of the ideological 
and terminological approach to the topic in the international arena, at that moment, and 
be  useful  for  the  study  of  the  evolution  and  usage  of  language  in  a  topic  over  time.  On 
the other hand, the use of some tags at classifying URLs connected to the globalization of 
agriculture, and the distinction among users in the way they use some words as labels, could 
yield other types of results. Are scientific users  utilizing the same tags as other professionals 
or general users? Perhaps different scientists or other users produce different labels around 
the same topic. Perhaps the first people tagging a topic are influencing the following tags 
that are incorporated in Delicious, etc. Nevertheless, some of this analysis can be limited by 
the information available from users. Other possible studies, going into more depth, may 
retrieve the pages that were labelled and undertake a content analysis to determine what 
kind of content is labelled through concrete tags. This is a cognitive way to see how users 
summarize  and  represent  in  short  and  definite  words  what  could  be  broad  and  detailed 
content. It could be a way to see keywords that remind them about something. Through 
this, different applications could be suggested (for instance, in advertising, mobilizing, etc.). 
Although this article has been more focused on the retrieval and illustration aspects, we 
have not shown networks of tags linked by users or by URLs tagged by users; a complementary, 
detailed  analysis  could  help  to  identify  users  that  have  the  same  patterns  at  tagging  or 
URLs that were similarly labelled. This opens a door to study structural equivalences and 
considering, for instance, applications for particular types of users. 

Other  questions  emerge,  as  to  why  some  labels  are  present  but  not  others?  Is  it  a 
question  of  language  usage?  Is  it  a  question  of  traditions  at  tagging  in  Web  2.0?  Is  it  a 
fashion? Supposedly, if people use Delicious for collaborative reasons, tags must at least be 
understandable for other users, unless the user prioritizes their own usage of Delicious.

6. concLusIons And Future reseArch
The main objective of this paper was presenting a methodology to use big data from Web 
2.0 in social research. We had an interest in illustrating the extraction of data from a social 
bookmarking site (Delicious) and showing the type of results that this type of analysis could 
offer to social scientists. As it concerned big series of data crawled from a large social tagging 

17

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchsystem, the analysis could have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, 
which form the basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors. 

Our approach represents an important first step towards the development of empirical 
techniques  capable  of  automatically  differentiating  groups  of  individuals  with  common 
interests, and individuals who occupy a more central position. This research is also of interest 
to make recommendations on the knowledge base of individual interests.

In addition, our analysis offers a previously unavailable understanding in the definition 
of recommendation services. To be able to identify a short list of the most centralized users 
and ties is extremely useful for researchers attempting to understand a community of more 
than a thousand links. This is particularly important for researchers interested in formulating 
strategies  for  intervention  and  mobilization,  but  practitioners  and  companies  could  also 
make  use  of  this.  The  discovery  of  the  central  elements  in  a  network  (users  and  URLs) 
and the tags employed by users could be a key to the design of future strategies for the 
dissemination of messages, while also helping to achieve more success in communications, 
such as making use of important keywords to attract greater attention, etc. At the same 
time, if we know other interests of the users belonging to a network - through, for instance, 
other webpages that they link, and others tags that they label - we would be able to make 
recommendations, as done by other systems such as Amazon. 

With regards to the process of retrieval of information, the method presented here was 
somewhat complex but easy to apply if there is some computer knowledge. Nevertheless, 
working in interdisciplinary teams could greatly help to develop this kind of knowledge, as 
it was in our case. Though the technical process described was successful, improvements are 
necessary in the future, at least regarding the retrieval methods and the implementation of 
IR and RS techniques in social commerce and social media contexts.

On the other hand, the relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by 
traditional Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, 
and  tags,  which  is  more  complex  to  manage.  This  article  has  laid  the  first  stone  in  the 
difficult process of understanding and discovering patterns in the process that characterizes 
users  tagging  URLs  for  collaborative  reasons.  The  application  was  made  under  the  topic 
‘globalization of agriculture’.

Some of the first contributions in the area of globalization of agriculture were that tags 
used to describe URLs in the Delicious’s social bookmarking site were mostly concentrated 
around a few terms.  The approximation to this topic in the future through other bookmarking 
sites (for instance, dominated by Spanish-speaking users) will allow the researchers to know 
if the recommended URLs are again media-based or are even the same webpages; or, for 
instance, if there is a semantic change concerning tags used for describing and classifying 
URLs.

Lastly, we do not want to close the article without clarifying that researching the topic 
of globalization of agriculture in a systematic and broad way may require the consideration 
of other starting points for the retrieval of information, at least to compare and contrast 
results. This is a limitation of this work. Nevertheless, the search yielded 1,700 different tags 
that have been used in the period of only a month to qualify and describe the phenomenon. 
It is a large number of tags, but we found a great concentration of them, as the centrality 
measure  showed.  The  same  argument  could  be  made  regarding  URLs,  in  that  they  were 
extremely concentrated in mass media. Of course, other analysis in the future could be made 
with a longer period of time, along with other explorations. This is only a beginning.

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

Most important Users and URLs are placed in the middle of the Figure 3, where density 
of connections is higher.  Figure 4 shows the degree of variability in the website and user

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

Table 2 shows the 10 most centralized websites, and we can see that nine are media-
based (online newspapers such as The New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, Washington 
Post, Financial Times, Reason, The Nation, Spiegel and The Economist).

11 These ten Users got 1,436 outbound links from a total of 10,219.

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

After  this  brief  description,  we  want  to  clarify  that  these  are  not  the  unique  results 
that  could  have  been  exposed  here,  after  the  complex  process  described  for  the  retrieval 
of information. We have chosen them as good examples that give sense to the operation 
of crawling big data, as first points of departure for knowing a bit more about the topic of 
globalization of agriculture, and for demonstrating the way that people describe and share 

15

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchwebsites about this issue through a modern and collaborative process of tagging. In the next 
section, a discussion about the results will be presented in order to know more about some 
alternative analyses, reflections, etc.

5. dIscussIon 
5.1. centrality and Power
Hanneman (2005) reminds us: “a very simple, but often very effective measure of an actor’s 
centrality and power potential is their degree”. In our case, as indegree concern URLs and as 
these represent some kind of collective actor, the determination of centrality measures make 
sense. Higher indegrees mean that the URLs are chosen by more users (they received more 
links). It is evident that the New York Times, in this network of globalization of agriculture 
in Delicious, greatly surpasses other URLs (with 1,203 inbound links, followed by the BBC 
website with 674 links). Most cited, recommended, or considered websites with regards to 
a topic occupy a central place and have an important role in the process of dissemination of 
news, events, trending topics, ideology, culture, etc. Knowing this previously hidden hierarchy 
is also very useful for different socioeconomic reasons. At the same time, this identification 
of key collective actors (represented here through URLs) allows a better comprehension of 
leadership, influence process, and power-related structures. For social practitioners, it is a 
good way to identify key informants in a community through whom disseminating useful 
and important information occurs.

Indegree in Table 2 also shows a very unequal distribution of power of the URLs cited by 
users in the topic of globalization of agriculture, represented by an important accumulation 
of inlinks.  Only 10 URLs represent an important, accumulated indegree). 

Regarding other actors in the networks, the users, for the identification of key actors 
that  disseminate  and  share  URLs,  as  the  previously  cited  Mritiunjoy,  it  is  important  to 
determine  from  where  key  elements  that  structure  the  network  emerge.  Is  it  possible  to 
explain why ‘that’ greatly important actor is in the network of globalization of agriculture? 
Key  actors  in  this  type  of  network  could  configure  and  reconfigure  the  evolution  of  the 
network, structure, and even manipulate the type of interchange of resources in Delicious or 
in similar bookmarking sites. 

Their prominence has something to say to social researchers, practitioners, etc.  Is it by 
chance? Are most prominent actors in the type of website like Delicious corresponding to a 
profile of very active and participative people? Do they usually work (or have as a hobby) in 
this area, which could explain the accumulation and tagging of so many URLs in Delicious? 
These and other questions could be answered in further steps of the research, depending on 
the concrete goals at each moment.

5.2. central tags: users producing tags
In the process of linking URLs in Delicious, the majority of users selected tags suggested 
by the website or added new tags in a creative way for describing or qualifying the URLs 
that they were recommended. A ‘tag cloud’ was built in order to have a visual approach to 
the language that was employed by users in their descriptions. As we have focused on the 
retrieval of information regarding the topic of globalization of agriculture, the question now 
is to wonder what we could know about this topic through the extracted tags. From a total 
of 1,700 tags, two words were the main ones, as most cited when users labelled URLs. It 
is important to note that each user could label a URL with an unlimited number of tags 
(average 12 tags per user, max 433 and min 2).  The most frequently used tags were the 
words: ‘economics’ (350 citations out of 1,700 tags, 20.6%) and ‘environment’ (273, 16%). 

16

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Other, very frequent tags were: sustainability (153), politics (152), economy (144), trade 
(131), business (99), poverty (97), culture (84), farming (84), africa (83), health (78), and 
development (76); in relative terms, these 13 tags represent one out of four labelled tags 
surrounding the topic (25.9%).

Discovering the importance of these words make us wonder not only of the reasons for 
the prominence of the first two tags regarding the globalization of agriculture but also for the 
rest. In addition, as 1,700 tags were also found qualifying and describing webpages regarding 
the topic of globalization of agriculture, some analyses are possible to know if some tags are 
used on an interchangeable basis, considered as synonyms, as was reported as one of the 
problems of collaborative tagging or the suggested vague-meaning problem (Kroski, 2005; 
Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007).

The same thing could be done regarding ‘term variations’. For instance, economy and 
economics are two important words in the topic of globalization of agriculture. Are these 
tags used in a similar or equivalent way at tagging? Why is the word economics sometimes 
used, and why, at other times, is economy used? Are they used in the same way at classifying 
the URLs?  

By limiting the analysis to a particular period of time, tags could be associated to the use of 
language at a particular moment. They could even be a good representation of the ideological 
and terminological approach to the topic in the international arena, at that moment, and 
be  useful  for  the  study  of  the  evolution  and  usage  of  language  in  a  topic  over  time.  On 
the other hand, the use of some tags at classifying URLs connected to the globalization of 
agriculture, and the distinction among users in the way they use some words as labels, could 
yield other types of results. Are scientific users  utilizing the same tags as other professionals 
or general users? Perhaps different scientists or other users produce different labels around 
the same topic. Perhaps the first people tagging a topic are influencing the following tags 
that are incorporated in Delicious, etc. Nevertheless, some of this analysis can be limited by 
the information available from users. Other possible studies, going into more depth, may 
retrieve the pages that were labelled and undertake a content analysis to determine what 
kind of content is labelled through concrete tags. This is a cognitive way to see how users 
summarize  and  represent  in  short  and  definite  words  what  could  be  broad  and  detailed 
content. It could be a way to see keywords that remind them about something. Through 
this, different applications could be suggested (for instance, in advertising, mobilizing, etc.). 
Although this article has been more focused on the retrieval and illustration aspects, we 
have not shown networks of tags linked by users or by URLs tagged by users; a complementary, 
detailed  analysis  could  help  to  identify  users  that  have  the  same  patterns  at  tagging  or 
URLs that were similarly labelled. This opens a door to study structural equivalences and 
considering, for instance, applications for particular types of users. 

Other  questions  emerge,  as  to  why  some  labels  are  present  but  not  others?  Is  it  a 
question  of  language  usage?  Is  it  a  question  of  traditions  at  tagging  in  Web  2.0?  Is  it  a 
fashion? Supposedly, if people use Delicious for collaborative reasons, tags must at least be 
understandable for other users, unless the user prioritizes their own usage of Delicious.

6. concLusIons And Future reseArch
The main objective of this paper was presenting a methodology to use big data from Web 
2.0 in social research. We had an interest in illustrating the extraction of data from a social 
bookmarking site (Delicious) and showing the type of results that this type of analysis could 
offer to social scientists. As it concerned big series of data crawled from a large social tagging 

17

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchsystem, the analysis could have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, 
which form the basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors. 

Our approach represents an important first step towards the development of empirical 
techniques  capable  of  automatically  differentiating  groups  of  individuals  with  common 
interests, and individuals who occupy a more central position. This research is also of interest 
to make recommendations on the knowledge base of individual interests.

In addition, our analysis offers a previously unavailable understanding in the definition 
of recommendation services. To be able to identify a short list of the most centralized users 
and ties is extremely useful for researchers attempting to understand a community of more 
than a thousand links. This is particularly important for researchers interested in formulating 
strategies  for  intervention  and  mobilization,  but  practitioners  and  companies  could  also 
make  use  of  this.  The  discovery  of  the  central  elements  in  a  network  (users  and  URLs) 
and the tags employed by users could be a key to the design of future strategies for the 
dissemination of messages, while also helping to achieve more success in communications, 
such as making use of important keywords to attract greater attention, etc. At the same 
time, if we know other interests of the users belonging to a network - through, for instance, 
other webpages that they link, and others tags that they label - we would be able to make 
recommendations, as done by other systems such as Amazon. 

With regards to the process of retrieval of information, the method presented here was 
somewhat complex but easy to apply if there is some computer knowledge. Nevertheless, 
working in interdisciplinary teams could greatly help to develop this kind of knowledge, as 
it was in our case. Though the technical process described was successful, improvements are 
necessary in the future, at least regarding the retrieval methods and the implementation of 
IR and RS techniques in social commerce and social media contexts.

On the other hand, the relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by 
traditional Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, 
and  tags,  which  is  more  complex  to  manage.  This  article  has  laid  the  first  stone  in  the 
difficult process of understanding and discovering patterns in the process that characterizes 
users  tagging  URLs  for  collaborative  reasons.  The  application  was  made  under  the  topic 
‘globalization of agriculture’.

Some of the first contributions in the area of globalization of agriculture were that tags 
used to describe URLs in the Delicious’s social bookmarking site were mostly concentrated 
around a few terms.  The approximation to this topic in the future through other bookmarking 
sites (for instance, dominated by Spanish-speaking users) will allow the researchers to know 
if the recommended URLs are again media-based or are even the same webpages; or, for 
instance, if there is a semantic change concerning tags used for describing and classifying 
URLs.

Lastly, we do not want to close the article without clarifying that researching the topic 
of globalization of agriculture in a systematic and broad way may require the consideration 
of other starting points for the retrieval of information, at least to compare and contrast 
results. This is a limitation of this work. Nevertheless, the search yielded 1,700 different tags 
that have been used in the period of only a month to qualify and describe the phenomenon. 
It is a large number of tags, but we found a great concentration of them, as the centrality 
measure  showed.  The  same  argument  could  be  made  regarding  URLs,  in  that  they  were 
extremely concentrated in mass media. Of course, other analysis in the future could be made 
with a longer period of time, along with other explorations. This is only a beginning.

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1other users. All bookmarks posted to Delicious are publicly viewable by default. Tagging in 
systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

10

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Figure 2. data collection Procedure

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

Table 1 shows the key words and the frequency with which they occurred around the 

topic of globalization of agriculture.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

Most important Users and URLs are placed in the middle of the Figure 3, where density 
of connections is higher.  Figure 4 shows the degree of variability in the website and user

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

Table 2 shows the 10 most centralized websites, and we can see that nine are media-
based (online newspapers such as The New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, Washington 
Post, Financial Times, Reason, The Nation, Spiegel and The Economist).

11 These ten Users got 1,436 outbound links from a total of 10,219.

14

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

After  this  brief  description,  we  want  to  clarify  that  these  are  not  the  unique  results 
that  could  have  been  exposed  here,  after  the  complex  process  described  for  the  retrieval 
of information. We have chosen them as good examples that give sense to the operation 
of crawling big data, as first points of departure for knowing a bit more about the topic of 
globalization of agriculture, and for demonstrating the way that people describe and share 

15

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchwebsites about this issue through a modern and collaborative process of tagging. In the next 
section, a discussion about the results will be presented in order to know more about some 
alternative analyses, reflections, etc.

5. dIscussIon 
5.1. centrality and Power
Hanneman (2005) reminds us: “a very simple, but often very effective measure of an actor’s 
centrality and power potential is their degree”. In our case, as indegree concern URLs and as 
these represent some kind of collective actor, the determination of centrality measures make 
sense. Higher indegrees mean that the URLs are chosen by more users (they received more 
links). It is evident that the New York Times, in this network of globalization of agriculture 
in Delicious, greatly surpasses other URLs (with 1,203 inbound links, followed by the BBC 
website with 674 links). Most cited, recommended, or considered websites with regards to 
a topic occupy a central place and have an important role in the process of dissemination of 
news, events, trending topics, ideology, culture, etc. Knowing this previously hidden hierarchy 
is also very useful for different socioeconomic reasons. At the same time, this identification 
of key collective actors (represented here through URLs) allows a better comprehension of 
leadership, influence process, and power-related structures. For social practitioners, it is a 
good way to identify key informants in a community through whom disseminating useful 
and important information occurs.

Indegree in Table 2 also shows a very unequal distribution of power of the URLs cited by 
users in the topic of globalization of agriculture, represented by an important accumulation 
of inlinks.  Only 10 URLs represent an important, accumulated indegree). 

Regarding other actors in the networks, the users, for the identification of key actors 
that  disseminate  and  share  URLs,  as  the  previously  cited  Mritiunjoy,  it  is  important  to 
determine  from  where  key  elements  that  structure  the  network  emerge.  Is  it  possible  to 
explain why ‘that’ greatly important actor is in the network of globalization of agriculture? 
Key  actors  in  this  type  of  network  could  configure  and  reconfigure  the  evolution  of  the 
network, structure, and even manipulate the type of interchange of resources in Delicious or 
in similar bookmarking sites. 

Their prominence has something to say to social researchers, practitioners, etc.  Is it by 
chance? Are most prominent actors in the type of website like Delicious corresponding to a 
profile of very active and participative people? Do they usually work (or have as a hobby) in 
this area, which could explain the accumulation and tagging of so many URLs in Delicious? 
These and other questions could be answered in further steps of the research, depending on 
the concrete goals at each moment.

5.2. central tags: users producing tags
In the process of linking URLs in Delicious, the majority of users selected tags suggested 
by the website or added new tags in a creative way for describing or qualifying the URLs 
that they were recommended. A ‘tag cloud’ was built in order to have a visual approach to 
the language that was employed by users in their descriptions. As we have focused on the 
retrieval of information regarding the topic of globalization of agriculture, the question now 
is to wonder what we could know about this topic through the extracted tags. From a total 
of 1,700 tags, two words were the main ones, as most cited when users labelled URLs. It 
is important to note that each user could label a URL with an unlimited number of tags 
(average 12 tags per user, max 433 and min 2).  The most frequently used tags were the 
words: ‘economics’ (350 citations out of 1,700 tags, 20.6%) and ‘environment’ (273, 16%). 

16

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Other, very frequent tags were: sustainability (153), politics (152), economy (144), trade 
(131), business (99), poverty (97), culture (84), farming (84), africa (83), health (78), and 
development (76); in relative terms, these 13 tags represent one out of four labelled tags 
surrounding the topic (25.9%).

Discovering the importance of these words make us wonder not only of the reasons for 
the prominence of the first two tags regarding the globalization of agriculture but also for the 
rest. In addition, as 1,700 tags were also found qualifying and describing webpages regarding 
the topic of globalization of agriculture, some analyses are possible to know if some tags are 
used on an interchangeable basis, considered as synonyms, as was reported as one of the 
problems of collaborative tagging or the suggested vague-meaning problem (Kroski, 2005; 
Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007).

The same thing could be done regarding ‘term variations’. For instance, economy and 
economics are two important words in the topic of globalization of agriculture. Are these 
tags used in a similar or equivalent way at tagging? Why is the word economics sometimes 
used, and why, at other times, is economy used? Are they used in the same way at classifying 
the URLs?  

By limiting the analysis to a particular period of time, tags could be associated to the use of 
language at a particular moment. They could even be a good representation of the ideological 
and terminological approach to the topic in the international arena, at that moment, and 
be  useful  for  the  study  of  the  evolution  and  usage  of  language  in  a  topic  over  time.  On 
the other hand, the use of some tags at classifying URLs connected to the globalization of 
agriculture, and the distinction among users in the way they use some words as labels, could 
yield other types of results. Are scientific users  utilizing the same tags as other professionals 
or general users? Perhaps different scientists or other users produce different labels around 
the same topic. Perhaps the first people tagging a topic are influencing the following tags 
that are incorporated in Delicious, etc. Nevertheless, some of this analysis can be limited by 
the information available from users. Other possible studies, going into more depth, may 
retrieve the pages that were labelled and undertake a content analysis to determine what 
kind of content is labelled through concrete tags. This is a cognitive way to see how users 
summarize  and  represent  in  short  and  definite  words  what  could  be  broad  and  detailed 
content. It could be a way to see keywords that remind them about something. Through 
this, different applications could be suggested (for instance, in advertising, mobilizing, etc.). 
Although this article has been more focused on the retrieval and illustration aspects, we 
have not shown networks of tags linked by users or by URLs tagged by users; a complementary, 
detailed  analysis  could  help  to  identify  users  that  have  the  same  patterns  at  tagging  or 
URLs that were similarly labelled. This opens a door to study structural equivalences and 
considering, for instance, applications for particular types of users. 

Other  questions  emerge,  as  to  why  some  labels  are  present  but  not  others?  Is  it  a 
question  of  language  usage?  Is  it  a  question  of  traditions  at  tagging  in  Web  2.0?  Is  it  a 
fashion? Supposedly, if people use Delicious for collaborative reasons, tags must at least be 
understandable for other users, unless the user prioritizes their own usage of Delicious.

6. concLusIons And Future reseArch
The main objective of this paper was presenting a methodology to use big data from Web 
2.0 in social research. We had an interest in illustrating the extraction of data from a social 
bookmarking site (Delicious) and showing the type of results that this type of analysis could 
offer to social scientists. As it concerned big series of data crawled from a large social tagging 

17

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchsystem, the analysis could have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, 
which form the basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors. 

Our approach represents an important first step towards the development of empirical 
techniques  capable  of  automatically  differentiating  groups  of  individuals  with  common 
interests, and individuals who occupy a more central position. This research is also of interest 
to make recommendations on the knowledge base of individual interests.

In addition, our analysis offers a previously unavailable understanding in the definition 
of recommendation services. To be able to identify a short list of the most centralized users 
and ties is extremely useful for researchers attempting to understand a community of more 
than a thousand links. This is particularly important for researchers interested in formulating 
strategies  for  intervention  and  mobilization,  but  practitioners  and  companies  could  also 
make  use  of  this.  The  discovery  of  the  central  elements  in  a  network  (users  and  URLs) 
and the tags employed by users could be a key to the design of future strategies for the 
dissemination of messages, while also helping to achieve more success in communications, 
such as making use of important keywords to attract greater attention, etc. At the same 
time, if we know other interests of the users belonging to a network - through, for instance, 
other webpages that they link, and others tags that they label - we would be able to make 
recommendations, as done by other systems such as Amazon. 

With regards to the process of retrieval of information, the method presented here was 
somewhat complex but easy to apply if there is some computer knowledge. Nevertheless, 
working in interdisciplinary teams could greatly help to develop this kind of knowledge, as 
it was in our case. Though the technical process described was successful, improvements are 
necessary in the future, at least regarding the retrieval methods and the implementation of 
IR and RS techniques in social commerce and social media contexts.

On the other hand, the relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by 
traditional Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, 
and  tags,  which  is  more  complex  to  manage.  This  article  has  laid  the  first  stone  in  the 
difficult process of understanding and discovering patterns in the process that characterizes 
users  tagging  URLs  for  collaborative  reasons.  The  application  was  made  under  the  topic 
‘globalization of agriculture’.

Some of the first contributions in the area of globalization of agriculture were that tags 
used to describe URLs in the Delicious’s social bookmarking site were mostly concentrated 
around a few terms.  The approximation to this topic in the future through other bookmarking 
sites (for instance, dominated by Spanish-speaking users) will allow the researchers to know 
if the recommended URLs are again media-based or are even the same webpages; or, for 
instance, if there is a semantic change concerning tags used for describing and classifying 
URLs.

Lastly, we do not want to close the article without clarifying that researching the topic 
of globalization of agriculture in a systematic and broad way may require the consideration 
of other starting points for the retrieval of information, at least to compare and contrast 
results. This is a limitation of this work. Nevertheless, the search yielded 1,700 different tags 
that have been used in the period of only a month to qualify and describe the phenomenon. 
It is a large number of tags, but we found a great concentration of them, as the centrality 
measure  showed.  The  same  argument  could  be  made  regarding  URLs,  in  that  they  were 
extremely concentrated in mass media. Of course, other analysis in the future could be made 
with a longer period of time, along with other explorations. This is only a beginning.

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

Most important Users and URLs are placed in the middle of the Figure 3, where density 
of connections is higher.  Figure 4 shows the degree of variability in the website and user 

8 In this work, we use Social Network Analysis for calculating some measures, but we do not show the visualization of the network.

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

Table 2 shows the 10 most centralized websites, and we can see that nine are media-
based (online newspapers such as The New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, Washington 
Post, Financial Times, Reason, The Nation, Spiegel and The Economist).

11 These ten Users got 1,436 outbound links from a total of 10,219.

14

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

After  this  brief  description,  we  want  to  clarify  that  these  are  not  the  unique  results 
that  could  have  been  exposed  here,  after  the  complex  process  described  for  the  retrieval 
of information. We have chosen them as good examples that give sense to the operation 
of crawling big data, as first points of departure for knowing a bit more about the topic of 
globalization of agriculture, and for demonstrating the way that people describe and share 

15

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchwebsites about this issue through a modern and collaborative process of tagging. In the next 
section, a discussion about the results will be presented in order to know more about some 
alternative analyses, reflections, etc.

5. dIscussIon 
5.1. centrality and Power
Hanneman (2005) reminds us: “a very simple, but often very effective measure of an actor’s 
centrality and power potential is their degree”. In our case, as indegree concern URLs and as 
these represent some kind of collective actor, the determination of centrality measures make 
sense. Higher indegrees mean that the URLs are chosen by more users (they received more 
links). It is evident that the New York Times, in this network of globalization of agriculture 
in Delicious, greatly surpasses other URLs (with 1,203 inbound links, followed by the BBC 
website with 674 links). Most cited, recommended, or considered websites with regards to 
a topic occupy a central place and have an important role in the process of dissemination of 
news, events, trending topics, ideology, culture, etc. Knowing this previously hidden hierarchy 
is also very useful for different socioeconomic reasons. At the same time, this identification 
of key collective actors (represented here through URLs) allows a better comprehension of 
leadership, influence process, and power-related structures. For social practitioners, it is a 
good way to identify key informants in a community through whom disseminating useful 
and important information occurs.

Indegree in Table 2 also shows a very unequal distribution of power of the URLs cited by 
users in the topic of globalization of agriculture, represented by an important accumulation 
of inlinks.  Only 10 URLs represent an important, accumulated indegree). 

Regarding other actors in the networks, the users, for the identification of key actors 
that  disseminate  and  share  URLs,  as  the  previously  cited  Mritiunjoy,  it  is  important  to 
determine  from  where  key  elements  that  structure  the  network  emerge.  Is  it  possible  to 
explain why ‘that’ greatly important actor is in the network of globalization of agriculture? 
Key  actors  in  this  type  of  network  could  configure  and  reconfigure  the  evolution  of  the 
network, structure, and even manipulate the type of interchange of resources in Delicious or 
in similar bookmarking sites. 

Their prominence has something to say to social researchers, practitioners, etc.  Is it by 
chance? Are most prominent actors in the type of website like Delicious corresponding to a 
profile of very active and participative people? Do they usually work (or have as a hobby) in 
this area, which could explain the accumulation and tagging of so many URLs in Delicious? 
These and other questions could be answered in further steps of the research, depending on 
the concrete goals at each moment.

5.2. central tags: users producing tags
In the process of linking URLs in Delicious, the majority of users selected tags suggested 
by the website or added new tags in a creative way for describing or qualifying the URLs 
that they were recommended. A ‘tag cloud’ was built in order to have a visual approach to 
the language that was employed by users in their descriptions. As we have focused on the 
retrieval of information regarding the topic of globalization of agriculture, the question now 
is to wonder what we could know about this topic through the extracted tags. From a total 
of 1,700 tags, two words were the main ones, as most cited when users labelled URLs. It 
is important to note that each user could label a URL with an unlimited number of tags 
(average 12 tags per user, max 433 and min 2).  The most frequently used tags were the 
words: ‘economics’ (350 citations out of 1,700 tags, 20.6%) and ‘environment’ (273, 16%). 

16

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Other, very frequent tags were: sustainability (153), politics (152), economy (144), trade 
(131), business (99), poverty (97), culture (84), farming (84), africa (83), health (78), and 
development (76); in relative terms, these 13 tags represent one out of four labelled tags 
surrounding the topic (25.9%).

Discovering the importance of these words make us wonder not only of the reasons for 
the prominence of the first two tags regarding the globalization of agriculture but also for the 
rest. In addition, as 1,700 tags were also found qualifying and describing webpages regarding 
the topic of globalization of agriculture, some analyses are possible to know if some tags are 
used on an interchangeable basis, considered as synonyms, as was reported as one of the 
problems of collaborative tagging or the suggested vague-meaning problem (Kroski, 2005; 
Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007).

The same thing could be done regarding ‘term variations’. For instance, economy and 
economics are two important words in the topic of globalization of agriculture. Are these 
tags used in a similar or equivalent way at tagging? Why is the word economics sometimes 
used, and why, at other times, is economy used? Are they used in the same way at classifying 
the URLs?  

By limiting the analysis to a particular period of time, tags could be associated to the use of 
language at a particular moment. They could even be a good representation of the ideological 
and terminological approach to the topic in the international arena, at that moment, and 
be  useful  for  the  study  of  the  evolution  and  usage  of  language  in  a  topic  over  time.  On 
the other hand, the use of some tags at classifying URLs connected to the globalization of 
agriculture, and the distinction among users in the way they use some words as labels, could 
yield other types of results. Are scientific users  utilizing the same tags as other professionals 
or general users? Perhaps different scientists or other users produce different labels around 
the same topic. Perhaps the first people tagging a topic are influencing the following tags 
that are incorporated in Delicious, etc. Nevertheless, some of this analysis can be limited by 
the information available from users. Other possible studies, going into more depth, may 
retrieve the pages that were labelled and undertake a content analysis to determine what 
kind of content is labelled through concrete tags. This is a cognitive way to see how users 
summarize  and  represent  in  short  and  definite  words  what  could  be  broad  and  detailed 
content. It could be a way to see keywords that remind them about something. Through 
this, different applications could be suggested (for instance, in advertising, mobilizing, etc.). 
Although this article has been more focused on the retrieval and illustration aspects, we 
have not shown networks of tags linked by users or by URLs tagged by users; a complementary, 
detailed  analysis  could  help  to  identify  users  that  have  the  same  patterns  at  tagging  or 
URLs that were similarly labelled. This opens a door to study structural equivalences and 
considering, for instance, applications for particular types of users. 

Other  questions  emerge,  as  to  why  some  labels  are  present  but  not  others?  Is  it  a 
question  of  language  usage?  Is  it  a  question  of  traditions  at  tagging  in  Web  2.0?  Is  it  a 
fashion? Supposedly, if people use Delicious for collaborative reasons, tags must at least be 
understandable for other users, unless the user prioritizes their own usage of Delicious.

6. concLusIons And Future reseArch
The main objective of this paper was presenting a methodology to use big data from Web 
2.0 in social research. We had an interest in illustrating the extraction of data from a social 
bookmarking site (Delicious) and showing the type of results that this type of analysis could 
offer to social scientists. As it concerned big series of data crawled from a large social tagging 

17

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchsystem, the analysis could have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, 
which form the basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors. 

Our approach represents an important first step towards the development of empirical 
techniques  capable  of  automatically  differentiating  groups  of  individuals  with  common 
interests, and individuals who occupy a more central position. This research is also of interest 
to make recommendations on the knowledge base of individual interests.

In addition, our analysis offers a previously unavailable understanding in the definition 
of recommendation services. To be able to identify a short list of the most centralized users 
and ties is extremely useful for researchers attempting to understand a community of more 
than a thousand links. This is particularly important for researchers interested in formulating 
strategies  for  intervention  and  mobilization,  but  practitioners  and  companies  could  also 
make  use  of  this.  The  discovery  of  the  central  elements  in  a  network  (users  and  URLs) 
and the tags employed by users could be a key to the design of future strategies for the 
dissemination of messages, while also helping to achieve more success in communications, 
such as making use of important keywords to attract greater attention, etc. At the same 
time, if we know other interests of the users belonging to a network - through, for instance, 
other webpages that they link, and others tags that they label - we would be able to make 
recommendations, as done by other systems such as Amazon. 

With regards to the process of retrieval of information, the method presented here was 
somewhat complex but easy to apply if there is some computer knowledge. Nevertheless, 
working in interdisciplinary teams could greatly help to develop this kind of knowledge, as 
it was in our case. Though the technical process described was successful, improvements are 
necessary in the future, at least regarding the retrieval methods and the implementation of 
IR and RS techniques in social commerce and social media contexts.

On the other hand, the relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by 
traditional Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, 
and  tags,  which  is  more  complex  to  manage.  This  article  has  laid  the  first  stone  in  the 
difficult process of understanding and discovering patterns in the process that characterizes 
users  tagging  URLs  for  collaborative  reasons.  The  application  was  made  under  the  topic 
‘globalization of agriculture’.

Some of the first contributions in the area of globalization of agriculture were that tags 
used to describe URLs in the Delicious’s social bookmarking site were mostly concentrated 
around a few terms.  The approximation to this topic in the future through other bookmarking 
sites (for instance, dominated by Spanish-speaking users) will allow the researchers to know 
if the recommended URLs are again media-based or are even the same webpages; or, for 
instance, if there is a semantic change concerning tags used for describing and classifying 
URLs.

Lastly, we do not want to close the article without clarifying that researching the topic 
of globalization of agriculture in a systematic and broad way may require the consideration 
of other starting points for the retrieval of information, at least to compare and contrast 
results. This is a limitation of this work. Nevertheless, the search yielded 1,700 different tags 
that have been used in the period of only a month to qualify and describe the phenomenon. 
It is a large number of tags, but we found a great concentration of them, as the centrality 
measure  showed.  The  same  argument  could  be  made  regarding  URLs,  in  that  they  were 
extremely concentrated in mass media. Of course, other analysis in the future could be made 
with a longer period of time, along with other explorations. This is only a beginning.

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

10

Source: Authors

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

After  this  brief  description,  we  want  to  clarify  that  these  are  not  the  unique  results 
that  could  have  been  exposed  here,  after  the  complex  process  described  for  the  retrieval 
of information. We have chosen them as good examples that give sense to the operation 
of crawling big data, as first points of departure for knowing a bit more about the topic of 
globalization of agriculture, and for demonstrating the way that people describe and share

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchwebsites about this issue through a modern and collaborative process of tagging. In the next 
section, a discussion about the results will be presented in order to know more about some 
alternative analyses, reflections, etc.

5. dIscussIon 
5.1. centrality and Power
Hanneman (2005) reminds us: “a very simple, but often very effective measure of an actor’s 
centrality and power potential is their degree”. In our case, as indegree concern URLs and as 
these represent some kind of collective actor, the determination of centrality measures make 
sense. Higher indegrees mean that the URLs are chosen by more users (they received more 
links). It is evident that the New York Times, in this network of globalization of agriculture 
in Delicious, greatly surpasses other URLs (with 1,203 inbound links, followed by the BBC 
website with 674 links). Most cited, recommended, or considered websites with regards to 
a topic occupy a central place and have an important role in the process of dissemination of 
news, events, trending topics, ideology, culture, etc. Knowing this previously hidden hierarchy 
is also very useful for different socioeconomic reasons. At the same time, this identification 
of key collective actors (represented here through URLs) allows a better comprehension of 
leadership, influence process, and power-related structures. For social practitioners, it is a 
good way to identify key informants in a community through whom disseminating useful 
and important information occurs.

Indegree in Table 2 also shows a very unequal distribution of power of the URLs cited by 
users in the topic of globalization of agriculture, represented by an important accumulation 
of inlinks.  Only 10 URLs represent an important, accumulated indegree). 

Regarding other actors in the networks, the users, for the identification of key actors 
that  disseminate  and  share  URLs,  as  the  previously  cited  Mritiunjoy,  it  is  important  to 
determine  from  where  key  elements  that  structure  the  network  emerge.  Is  it  possible  to 
explain why ‘that’ greatly important actor is in the network of globalization of agriculture? 
Key  actors  in  this  type  of  network  could  configure  and  reconfigure  the  evolution  of  the 
network, structure, and even manipulate the type of interchange of resources in Delicious or 
in similar bookmarking sites. 

Their prominence has something to say to social researchers, practitioners, etc.  Is it by 
chance? Are most prominent actors in the type of website like Delicious corresponding to a 
profile of very active and participative people? Do they usually work (or have as a hobby) in 
this area, which could explain the accumulation and tagging of so many URLs in Delicious? 
These and other questions could be answered in further steps of the research, depending on 
the concrete goals at each moment.

5.2. central tags: users producing tags
In the process of linking URLs in Delicious, the majority of users selected tags suggested 
by the website or added new tags in a creative way for describing or qualifying the URLs 
that they were recommended. A ‘tag cloud’ was built in order to have a visual approach to 
the language that was employed by users in their descriptions. As we have focused on the 
retrieval of information regarding the topic of globalization of agriculture, the question now 
is to wonder what we could know about this topic through the extracted tags. From a total 
of 1,700 tags, two words were the main ones, as most cited when users labelled URLs. It 
is important to note that each user could label a URL with an unlimited number of tags 
(average 12 tags per user, max 433 and min 2).  The most frequently used tags were the 
words: ‘economics’ (350 citations out of 1,700 tags, 20.6%) and ‘environment’ (273, 16%). 

16

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Other, very frequent tags were: sustainability (153), politics (152), economy (144), trade 
(131), business (99), poverty (97), culture (84), farming (84), africa (83), health (78), and 
development (76); in relative terms, these 13 tags represent one out of four labelled tags 
surrounding the topic (25.9%).

Discovering the importance of these words make us wonder not only of the reasons for 
the prominence of the first two tags regarding the globalization of agriculture but also for the 
rest. In addition, as 1,700 tags were also found qualifying and describing webpages regarding 
the topic of globalization of agriculture, some analyses are possible to know if some tags are 
used on an interchangeable basis, considered as synonyms, as was reported as one of the 
problems of collaborative tagging or the suggested vague-meaning problem (Kroski, 2005; 
Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007).

The same thing could be done regarding ‘term variations’. For instance, economy and 
economics are two important words in the topic of globalization of agriculture. Are these 
tags used in a similar or equivalent way at tagging? Why is the word economics sometimes 
used, and why, at other times, is economy used? Are they used in the same way at classifying 
the URLs?  

By limiting the analysis to a particular period of time, tags could be associated to the use of 
language at a particular moment. They could even be a good representation of the ideological 
and terminological approach to the topic in the international arena, at that moment, and 
be  useful  for  the  study  of  the  evolution  and  usage  of  language  in  a  topic  over  time.  On 
the other hand, the use of some tags at classifying URLs connected to the globalization of 
agriculture, and the distinction among users in the way they use some words as labels, could 
yield other types of results. Are scientific users  utilizing the same tags as other professionals 
or general users? Perhaps different scientists or other users produce different labels around 
the same topic. Perhaps the first people tagging a topic are influencing the following tags 
that are incorporated in Delicious, etc. Nevertheless, some of this analysis can be limited by 
the information available from users. Other possible studies, going into more depth, may 
retrieve the pages that were labelled and undertake a content analysis to determine what 
kind of content is labelled through concrete tags. This is a cognitive way to see how users 
summarize  and  represent  in  short  and  definite  words  what  could  be  broad  and  detailed 
content. It could be a way to see keywords that remind them about something. Through 
this, different applications could be suggested (for instance, in advertising, mobilizing, etc.). 
Although this article has been more focused on the retrieval and illustration aspects, we 
have not shown networks of tags linked by users or by URLs tagged by users; a complementary, 
detailed  analysis  could  help  to  identify  users  that  have  the  same  patterns  at  tagging  or 
URLs that were similarly labelled. This opens a door to study structural equivalences and 
considering, for instance, applications for particular types of users. 

Other  questions  emerge,  as  to  why  some  labels  are  present  but  not  others?  Is  it  a 
question  of  language  usage?  Is  it  a  question  of  traditions  at  tagging  in  Web  2.0?  Is  it  a 
fashion? Supposedly, if people use Delicious for collaborative reasons, tags must at least be 
understandable for other users, unless the user prioritizes their own usage of Delicious.

6. concLusIons And Future reseArch
The main objective of this paper was presenting a methodology to use big data from Web 
2.0 in social research. We had an interest in illustrating the extraction of data from a social 
bookmarking site (Delicious) and showing the type of results that this type of analysis could 
offer to social scientists. As it concerned big series of data crawled from a large social tagging 

17

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchsystem, the analysis could have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, 
which form the basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors. 

Our approach represents an important first step towards the development of empirical 
techniques  capable  of  automatically  differentiating  groups  of  individuals  with  common 
interests, and individuals who occupy a more central position. This research is also of interest 
to make recommendations on the knowledge base of individual interests.

In addition, our analysis offers a previously unavailable understanding in the definition 
of recommendation services. To be able to identify a short list of the most centralized users 
and ties is extremely useful for researchers attempting to understand a community of more 
than a thousand links. This is particularly important for researchers interested in formulating 
strategies  for  intervention  and  mobilization,  but  practitioners  and  companies  could  also 
make  use  of  this.  The  discovery  of  the  central  elements  in  a  network  (users  and  URLs) 
and the tags employed by users could be a key to the design of future strategies for the 
dissemination of messages, while also helping to achieve more success in communications, 
such as making use of important keywords to attract greater attention, etc. At the same 
time, if we know other interests of the users belonging to a network - through, for instance, 
other webpages that they link, and others tags that they label - we would be able to make 
recommendations, as done by other systems such as Amazon. 

With regards to the process of retrieval of information, the method presented here was 
somewhat complex but easy to apply if there is some computer knowledge. Nevertheless, 
working in interdisciplinary teams could greatly help to develop this kind of knowledge, as 
it was in our case. Though the technical process described was successful, improvements are 
necessary in the future, at least regarding the retrieval methods and the implementation of 
IR and RS techniques in social commerce and social media contexts.

On the other hand, the relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by 
traditional Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, 
and  tags,  which  is  more  complex  to  manage.  This  article  has  laid  the  first  stone  in  the 
difficult process of understanding and discovering patterns in the process that characterizes 
users  tagging  URLs  for  collaborative  reasons.  The  application  was  made  under  the  topic 
‘globalization of agriculture’.

Some of the first contributions in the area of globalization of agriculture were that tags 
used to describe URLs in the Delicious’s social bookmarking site were mostly concentrated 
around a few terms.  The approximation to this topic in the future through other bookmarking 
sites (for instance, dominated by Spanish-speaking users) will allow the researchers to know 
if the recommended URLs are again media-based or are even the same webpages; or, for 
instance, if there is a semantic change concerning tags used for describing and classifying 
URLs.

Lastly, we do not want to close the article without clarifying that researching the topic 
of globalization of agriculture in a systematic and broad way may require the consideration 
of other starting points for the retrieval of information, at least to compare and contrast 
results. This is a limitation of this work. Nevertheless, the search yielded 1,700 different tags 
that have been used in the period of only a month to qualify and describe the phenomenon. 
It is a large number of tags, but we found a great concentration of them, as the centrality 
measure  showed.  The  same  argument  could  be  made  regarding  URLs,  in  that  they  were 
extremely concentrated in mass media. Of course, other analysis in the future could be made 
with a longer period of time, along with other explorations. This is only a beginning.

AbstrAct
Tags  and  keywords,  freely  chosen  by  users  for  annotating  resources,  offer  a  new  way 
for  organizing  and  retrieving  web  resources  that  closely  reflect  the  users’  interests  and 
preferences,  as  well  as  automatically  generate  folksonomies.  Social  tagging  systems  have 
gained  increasing  popularity  as  a  method  for  annotating  and  categorizing  a  wide  range 
of  different  web  resources.  They  also  attract  researchers  in  social  sciences  because  they 
offer a huge quantity of user-generated annotations that reveal the interests of millions of 
people. To date, the study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical 
framework, particularly in social science research. This paper presents a methodology to use 
big data from Web 2.0 in social research. At the same time, it applies a method to extract 
data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and shows the sort of results that 
this type of analysis can offer to social scientists. The illustration is made around the topic 
of globalization of agriculture. Using data crawled from a large social tagging system can 
have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, which is needed to provide 
effective recommendations to different actors. In this paper, a sample of 851 users, 526 URLs 
and 1,700 tags from the Delicious classification system on the subject of globalization were 
retrieved and analyzed. Through the analysis, main users and websites around globalization 
issues in Delicious emerged, along with discovering the most important tags that were applied 
by users to describe the globalization of agriculture. The implications of these methodology 
and findings for further research are discussed.

1. IntroductIon
The advent of the social web has significantly contributed to the explosion of web content 
and, as a side effect, to the consequent, explosive growth of the information overload. Thus, in 
recent years, there has been a substantial growth in social computing systems (Parameswaran 
and  Whinston,  2007a;  Kwai  Fun  and  Wagner,  2008)  that  serves  as  intermediaries  for 
social relations (Schuler, 1994) and are characterized by online community formation and 
user  content  creation  (Parameswaran  and  Whinston,  2007b;  Duan  et  al.,  2008).  Some 
of  the  best  known  social  computing  systems  are  content  sites  such  as  Wikipedia,  Flickr, 
YouTube,  social  networking  sites  such  as  Facebook,  microblogging  such  as  Twitter,  and 
social  bookmarking  services  such  as  Delicious  (Marlow  et  al.,  2006;  Parameswaran  and 
Whinston,  2007a).  Overall,  these  social  computing  systems  are  characterized  by  a  high 

3

heterogeneity of information sources and make large amounts of information available to 
their users (Schueler et al., 2007; Vickery and Wunsch-Vincent, 2007). For some authors, 
certain data collection methods commonly applied in social studies like interviews or surveys 
have yielded inconclusive results, especially when it is in a web environment (Herring et al., 
2004; Nardi et al., 2004; Yao, 2009). However, some studies are already deploying automatic 
data extraction techniques (Garrido and Halavais, 2003; Jones et al., 2008; Shumate and 
Dewitt, 2008; Xu et al., 2008; Carmel et al., 2009; Wang and Jin, 2010; Ackland and O’Neil, 
2011) from big data. These techniques are of interest to social researchers; but, to date, the 
study using digital trace data methods continues to lack a theoretical framework (Janetsko, 
2009:  170).  Some  authors  clearly  point  out  the  need  for  flexibility  and  adaptability  of 
the methodology (quantitative and cualitative techniques) to the object (Domínguez et al., 
2010: 10), and also focus on discovering collaborative process methods and tools (Zacarias 
and  Ventura,  2011:  45).  Our  first  objective  will  be  to  present  a  methodology  to  use  big 
data from Web 2.0 in social research, and then to show the sort of results that this type of 
analysis can offer to social scientists.

Currently, the extensive use of the social web is emphasizing the central role of users and 
their (cor)relations. The focus is on the profile, preferences, needs, feedbacks, reputation, 
relationships, and, last but not least, the personal way each user classifies the huge amount 
of information at her/his disposal in the form of tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow 
et al., 2006; Cattuto et al., 2007a; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Dattolo et al., 2012). Tags are 
keywords freely chosen by users (e.g. “globalization”, “agriculture”, “trade”), employed to 
annotate various types of digital content including images, bookmarks, blogs, and videos 
(Golder and Huberman, 2006; Shneiderman et al., 2006; Rattenbury et al., 2007; Trant, 
2009).  The  idea  behind  the  concept  of  tagging  is  simple:  a  user  enjoys  a  resource  –  e.g. 
an  image  or  a  website  –  and,  according  to  her/his  mental  model,  identifies  those  terms 
that better describe the information conveyed by that resource. The same resource can be 
annotated by several users: some of them will reuse the tags already assigned to that resource, 
while others will adopt new tags. Social tags produced by users are usually regarded as high 
quality descriptors of the web pages’ topics and a good indicator of web users’ interests and 
preferences. This process also allows building of a socially-constructed classification schema, 
called folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2007).

Social  tagging  systems  have  recently  begun  receiving  increasing  attention  from  the 
scientific community. The growing number of scientific publications concerning this issue 
and the development of real, social tagging systems, such as social networks (Twitter), social 
bookmarking applications (Delicious), sharing systems (Flickr), and in the e-commerce field 
(Amazon), confirm this tendency. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, 
to  the  benefits  users  gain  from  effectively  organizing  and  sharing  very  large  amounts  of 
information (Cattuto et al., 2007b) and users’ interests (Golder and Huberman, 2006).

Some  prominent  examples  of  a  tagging-intensive  social  computing  system  are  social 
bookmarking  sites  such  as  Digg,  StumbleUpon,  Reddit,  Pinterest,  and  Delicious1.  These 
services are an inestimable source of information for scholars, as they produce a huge amount 
of user annotations (tags) and reflect the interests of millions of users. The social aspects 
of these systems derive from the fact that the resources (mainly websites) are tagged by the 
community, a feature known as collaborative tagging, which provides important metadata 
for investigators and others practitioners.

Delicious (www.delicious.com) – formerly del.icio.us in 2003 – is a free, social bookmarking 
web  service  for  storing,  sharing,  and  discovering  web  bookmarks.  Delicious  uses  a  non-
hierarchical classification system in which users can tag each of their bookmarks with freely 
chosen  index  terms.  Its  collective  nature  makes  it  possible  to  view  bookmarks  added  by

systems like Delicious is an important change in the way web bookmarks are organized and 
shared (Ames and Naaman, 2007).

Introducing folksonomies as the basis for social network analysis means that the usual 
binary  relation  between  users  and  resources,  which  is  largely  employed  by  traditional 
Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags 
which is more complex to manage. Nevertheless, very few works highlight how to employ 
folksonomies in the field of social research. This leads us to think that further researches, 
evaluation studies, and insights are needed. Hence, our second objective in this paper will be 
to use data crawled from a large social tagging system to discover latent patterns, which will 
form a basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors.

Due  to  the  current  lack  of  a  theoretical  framework  in  retrieving  automatic  data  and 
analyzing digital data in social science research, this paper presents a methodology to use big 
data from Web 2.0 in this field. At the same time, it applies this method to automatically 
extract data from a particular social bookmarking site (Delicious) and to show the type of 
results that this kind of analysis can offer to social scientists.

We focus our study on the Delicious site, specifically, in its user community around the 
issue of globalization of agriculture. According to Stiglitz (2006), issues such as bilateral 
trade are impeding development in the world’s poorest countries. The globalization of the 
agriculture system is at the centre of this debate, because so many poor people depend on 
agriculture as an income source and because they spend a large proportion of their resources 
on food. Given that the majority of the poor inhabit rural areas and earn a living as small 
farmers,  the  effects  of  globalization  on  employment  and  small-farm  competitiveness  are 
central to determining its impact on poverty.

This paper begins by reviewing the literature around collaborative tagging, paying specific 
attention to meta-knowledge and networks perspectives. Then we expound the methodology, 
laying out the empirical data and describing in detail the data extraction process applied. 
The next sections analyze and provide the results of a study that involved 851 users on 
1,077 URLs and 1,700 tags, before concluding with a discussion of several implications for 
research and practice.

2. LIterAture revIew
2.1. web 2.0 and collaborative tagging
The  Web  2.0  concept  was  developed  by  Tim  O’Reilly  (O’Reilly,  2007).  According  to 
O’Reilly, ‘‘Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move 
to  the  Internet  as  platform,  and  an  attempt  to  understand  the  rules  for  success  on  that 
new platform2.” Web 2.0 is combined with the programmable Web and was designed to be 
dynamic, peer to peer, and an online storage of knowledge.

Collaborative – or social – tagging is the activity in Web 2.0 of annotating digital resources 
with keywords, or so-called tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Trant, 2009). This process is 
easy to indulge in, because it does not require any professional background; all that is needed 
is to freely choose keywords from an individual’s vocabulary to annotate a Web resource. 
This process of annotation has converted ordinary people into metadata generators. Hence, 
collaborative tagging is a form of a user-centric, social, and democratic method of indexing. 
The  use  of  tags  creates  a  collective  classification  scheme  and  provides  a  snapshot  of  the 
current mindset of the user.

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic ResearchCollaborative  tagging  has  two  purposes:  first,  it  can  quickly  generate  personal 
categorizations  for  later  information  retrieval;  second,  the  collective  use  of  tags  makes 
inferences  about  related  resources  and  tags  possible.  A  resource  can  be  tagged  with  an 
unlimited number of tags. The collaborative tagging of websites allows for the organization 
and sharing of digital resources. These websites allow users to publicly tag available resources 
and share content; therefore, users can categorize information by themselves and browse or 
search for the information by using these tags (Golder and Huberman, 2006). In this sense, 
the collaborative tagging of websites works as a shared resource for a given community of 
actors that could be used for different motives and in different moments.

A collaborative tagging system is mainly composed of three interconnected components –
users, tags, and resources (Smith, 2008) – which can be described as follows:
•	 Users: They employ a tagging system to create tags, and sometimes they add resources. 
Users – who have a variety of different interests, needs, goals, and motivations – try to 
share or label a resource so they can find it later.

•	 Resources: They are the items that users tag such as the Web pages in Delicious and 

the photos in Flickr.

•	 Tags: They are the keywords added by users. Tags are essentially metadata about the 
resource. Users can tag just about any kind of term to resources, and different users 
have different tagging patterns.

2.2. tagging and Folksonomy
Social tagging systems aggregate the tags of all users and describe the resources in a so-called 
folksonomy (Vander Wal, 2004; Trant, 2009). The word ‘‘folksonomy” (Vander Wal, 2004) 
is a combination of ‘‘folks” and ‘‘taxonomy”. Recently, the use of folksonomies gained more 
attention  because  of  their  simplicity:  using  tags,  users  can  freely  model  the  information 
without the constraints of a predefined lexicon or hierarchy (Mathes, 2004). Folks are the 
common  people  of  a  society;  taxonomy  means  a  hierarchical  structure  of  classification. 
However, the simplicity of the approach also has an important drawback: the information 
managed by folksonomies is modeled in a simple, syntactical way. Therefore, collaborative 
tagging  systems  suffer  from  the  vague-meaning  problem  when  users  retrieve  or  present 
resources with keyword-based tags. The vague-meaning problem is created by the following 
causes (Kroski, 2005; Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007):

•	 Synonyms: It is when multiple tags share the same meaning. For example, resources 
tagged as Web site and Website, or global warming and climate change could have the same 
meaning: the first ones are semantically similar, and in the second example the words 
are differents. However, collaborative tagging systems do not understand it. 

•	 Term variations: There is no standard for the structure of tags; for instance, a noun 
can  be  singular  or  plural,  uppercase  or  lowercase.  In  collaborative  tagging  systems, 
we  can  also  have  simple,  morphological  variations.  Moreover,  mis-tagging  due  to 
spelling errors occurs often. Also, spacing is not allowed in a tag in most collaborative 
tagging systems; therefore, both the underscore and the hyphen are typically used to 
separate words by a single tag. Additionally, different possible spellings of the same 
word and tags using different languages generate term variations such as globalization 
and globalisation.

•	 Lack  of  relationships:  Relationships  between  tags  cannot  be  structured  in  existing, 
collaborative tagging systems. For instance, resources might be labeled with the tags 
fast food or hamburger, and there is no mechanism that might indicate that hamburger 
is a sub-class of fast food.

These drawbacks hinder the use of folksonomies for tasks more complex than the simple 
browsing of resources. In order to avoid these problems, in recent years many tools have 

6

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1been  developed  to  facilitate  the  user  in  the  task  of  tagging,  by  also  speeding  up  the  tag 
convergence (Cattuto et al., 2007b).

2.3. the collective knowledge inherent in social tags
Social tagging is the process by which many users add metadata in the form of keyword-
based tags to shared resources. In social tagging systems, users can annotate a variety of 
digital resources with tags, for instance, bookmarks (e.g. www.delicious.com), pictures (e.g. 
www.flickr.com), or products (e.g. www.amazon.com). In most applications, users are free 
to choose any tags for describing their resources in order to structure, organize, and re-find 
their own stored Web material. The tags that are used will reflect individual associations 
with  regard  to  resources,  and  they  will  describe  a  specific  meaning  or  relevance  for  the 
respective users. The social aspect of social tagging systems lies in the opportunity to use 
other  people’s  tags  as  navigation  links  for  one’s  own  search  processes.  The  folksonomy 
process is developed in a bottom-up process of individual tagging in which the tags of many 
different users are aggregated and the resulting collective tag structure – such as tag cloud – 
depicts the collective knowledge of Web users (Cress et al., 2012) – although, in some cases, 
such as by laziness, users could have aggregated tags suggested by the social tagging system. 
The individual users’ tags establish a network of connections between resources and tags, 
and among those tags themselves. The more frequently tags are used for one resource, the 
stronger the connection becomes among them. Analogously, the more often two tags co-occur 
for one resource, the stronger they are related to each other. Social tagging systems can be 
considered shared, external knowledge structures of communities (Fu, 2008) and augment 
the collective structure of a community with the individual knowledge representations of 
individual users. When aggregating all tags from a community, a collective representation of 
the connections between related tags and their strengths of association will emerge. These 
associations are typically visualized by tag clouds, in which different font sizes represent 
the strength of association of tags to a related tag or a resource. Tag clouds externalize the 
community’s associations between tags and the strengths of associations. In this way, social 
tags are able to provide visual representations of the conceptual structure of a domain that is 
built upon the knowledge of individuals who belong to a large Web community. One study 
(Kammerer et al., 2009) showed that tags as navigational signposts are able to provide a kind 
of  scaffold  to  learn  new  topics,  leading  to  better  understanding  of  a  knowledge  domain. 
Although a few studies have investigated the influence of tag clouds on visual attention, 
recognition, and tag selection (Rivadeneira et al., 2007; Bateman et al., 2008), this research 
addresses how users could use this collective knowledge representation.

Much  research  on  social  tagging  has  focused  on  the  description  of  regularities  in 
user activities (e.g. Golder and Huberman, 2006; Millen et al., 2007). Research has also 
investigated the motivation of people to tag and the research question of how to design 
Web  sites  and  platforms  in  order  to  motivate  users  to  annotate  content  with  social  tags 
(Van Velsen and Melenhorst, 2009). However, surprisingly little is known about how these 
new technologies directly interact with individuals at the knowledge and cognitive level (Fu, 
2008).

The  first  study  that  investigated  the  interplay  between  collective  and  individual 
knowledge was presented by Fu (2008). He introduced a rational model of social tagging in 
Delicious and provided evidence for the interaction between social and cognitive systems. 
Further studies addressed the emergence of stable tagging patterns (Kannampallil and Fu, 
2009) or investigated how the use of social tags affects search performance (Fu et al., 2010), 
tag choice, and the individual interpretation of documents through processes of imitation 
(Fu et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2009), users’ behaviours (Kang and Fu, 2010), or innovation 
impacts in organizations (Parise and Iyer, 2011), with Delicious as well. In these studies, 

7

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchmodel simulations were used to demonstrate the exchange process between the collective 
knowledge that is inherent in social tags and the individual knowledge of users. These studies 
show the potential of social tagging systems.

2.4. tagging and social networks
The structure of Social tagging websites can be viewed as a network consisting of three parts, 
or a network of three different node types: the u users, the r resources (web sites – URLs), 
and the t tags that the u users deploy to tag the r web sites. A user can attach one or more 
tags to a URL. The network that emerges can be graphically illustrated by means of the 1 
link between the u user and the r website that passes through the t tag.

A particular class of networks is the bipartite networks, whose nodes are divided into 
two sets (e.g. users and tags), and only the connection between two nodes in different sets 
is allowed, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. A bipartite network made of three users u=(u,u’,u’’), three tags t=(t,t’,t’’) and two 
kinds of links: between users ru (straight lines), and between users and tags rt (dashed lines)

Source: Authors

Two kinds of bipartite networks are important because of their particular significance 
in  social,  economic,  and  information  systems.  One  is  the  so-called  collaboration  network, 
which  is  generally  defined  as  a  network  of  actors  connected  by  a  common  collaboration 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Scott, 2000). Examples in the social systems are numerous, 
such as scientists connected by coauthoring a scientific paper or movie actors connected by 
co-starring in the same movie, or in other fields like on the technological collaboration of 
software and urban traffic systems. The other one is called the opinion network (Maslov and 
Zhang, 2001; Blattner et al., 2007), in which users connect to the objects that they gather. 
For example, listeners are connected with the music groups they collected from a music-
sharing library such as iTunes, web-users are connected with the webs they collected from 
a bookmark site such as Delicious, or customers are connected with the books they bought 
from a site such as Amazon.

A central problem closely related to the opinion network is how to extract the hidden 
information. The exponential growth of the Internet confronts people with an information

data analysis in the context of social networks analysis. This paper is an approach to these 
references.

2.5. social web and its impact on Information retrieval (Ir) and recommender 
systems (rs)
During the last few years, the advent of the Social Web has greatly changed the role of Web 
users, providing them with the opportunity to become key actors and to share knowledge, 
opinions and tastes thanks to the interaction through online media.

2.5.1. Recommender Systems and Social Web
Introducing  folksonomies  as  the  basis  for  recommendations  means  that  the  usual  binary 
relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by traditional RS, changes into 
a ternary relation between users, resources, and tags, thus becoming more complex to manage.
Different surveys (Dattolo et al., 2012; Kumar and Thambidurai, 2010) analyze the use 
of social tagging activities for recommendations, focusing their attention particularly on the 
following aspects:

•	 RS improvement due to tags: an interesting overview on social tagging systems and 
their  impact  on  RS  is  presented  in  Milicevic  et  al.  (2010),  while  a  methodology 
to  improve  RS  due  to  Web  2.0  systems,  and  particularly  to  social  bookmarking 
platforms, is offered by Siersdorfer and Sizov (2009); moreover, Xia (2010) provides 
a recommender system model based on tags.

•	 Role of tag recommendation: the system presented in Rendle and Lars (2010) exploits 
a factorization model to propose personalized tag recommendations, while Niwa et 
al. (2006) illustrate a strategy used in a Web page recommender system exploiting 
affinities  between  users  and  tags.  In  addition  to  these  affinities,  Durao  and  Dolog 
(2009) propose a recommender system exploiting tag popularity and representativeness 
to recommend web pages.

•	 Tags  and  User  modeling:  since  RS  rely  on  a  user  model  to  generally  personalize 
recommendations, Wetzker et al. (2010) propose an original way to enhance modeling 
to improve tag recommendation. In a general context, Carmagnola et al. (2007) and 
Simpson and Butler (2009) also illustrate how tag activity can improve user modeling.

2.5.2. Information Retrieval and the Social Web
From  a  Social  IR  point  of  view,  i.e.  IR  that  uses  folksonomies,  tags  and  particularly  the 
relations between tags have been studied as a novel knowledge base related to information 
exploited in the IR process:

•	 As a pull approach, users retrieving information need to understand what information 
is available to identify which one is relevant to their need. A tag cloud has been used in 
this context to offer an original and improved visual IR interface (Hassan-Montero and 
Herrero-Solana, 2006; Bar-Ilan et al., 2010) which allows user browsing information. 
A more powerful visualization based on tag clusters (Knautz et al., 2010) is considered 
as better than a tag cloud.

•	 FolkRank  (Hotho  et  al.,  2006)  is  a  new  search  algorithm  for  folksonomies.  It  can 
also be used to identify communities within the folksonomy that are used to adapt 
information  ranking.  This  algorithm  is  inspired  from  the  famous  PageRank  model 
from Google. Information ranking (scoring) has also been studied according to query 
(Liu et al., 2009). Another document ranking based on relationships extracted from 
the different node types - user, tag, and resource - is illustrated in Bender et al. (2008).

9

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Research•	 IR have also been improved thanks to folksonomies and two original measures (Bao 
et  al.,  2007):  SocialPageRank,  which  computes  the  popularity  of  web  pages,  and 
SocialSimRank, which calculates the similarity between tags and queries.

•	 Query expansion based on tag co-occurrence has been studied in Wang and Davison 
(2008), Biancalana and Micarelli (2009), and Jin et al. (2009). Results show that such 
an approach consistently improves retrieval performance.

In summary, this paper aims to exhibit a methodology to retrieve big data from Web 2.0 
and use social network analysis in order to represent the main users and websites around 
the  globalization  of  agriculture  issue  in  a  particular  social  bookmarking  site  –  Delicious 
–, along with the most important tags that were employed by users around this topic. An 
additional aim is examining if it is possible to discover latent pattern links to the activity of 
collaborative tagging, which could be key in order to provide effective recommendations to 
different actors.

3. MethodoLogy
The setting chosen for this study is Delicious (www.delicious.com). Delicious is a prominent 
example of a social bookmarking system whose content is created, annotated and viewed 
by its users. Delicious uses a non-hierarchical classification system in which users can tag 
each of their bookmarks on the Delicious website, and it provides knowledge about the URL 
marked (Golder and Huberman, 2006; Marlow et al., 2006). Its collective nature makes it 
possible to view bookmarks added by other users. Delicious also allows users to organize 
existing tags into groups, called tag bundles. In addition, a Delicious user can follow the 
latest discoveries from people who share their interests. Hence, we believe that Delicious 
would be a good setting to investigate how to discover latent structures by using data crawled 
from a large, social tagging system.

3.1. data collection procedure
In  Social  Bookmarking  Services,  an  annotation  typically  consists  of  at  least  four  parts. 
The link to the resource (e.g. to the website), one or more tags, the user who makes the 
annotation, and the moment when the annotation is made: user, resource, tag, and time. A 
user labels a resource with a specific tag at a given moment. This paper is less interested in 
when the annotation took place than in the co-occurrence of users, resources and tags (user, 
resource, tag). The dataset collected is written as: u = {u1; u2; : : : ; uK}, r = {r1; r2; : : : ; 
rM}, and t = {t1; t2; : : : ; tN} as the set of K users, M URLs, and N tags, respectively.

We  built  the  network  of  globalization  of  agriculture  using  a  combination  of  search 
techniques proposed for researching “issue networks” (Rogers and Zelman, 2002): associative 
reasoning, whereby educated guesses are made about relevant issues and related websites; 
public trust logics, finding groups commonly linked to by players trusted to be important 
in the debate; media stories, following links from an authoritative news source; and search 
engine crawls of key words.

The process to retrieve the data and of representing the Delicious community as a network 

follows a procedure that we present in Figure 2:

Firstly  (A),  following  links  from  an  authoritative  news  source,  we  identify  the  search 
attributes on the basis of an original sample of a set of 26 web pages (Appendix 1), according 
to the Wikipedia definition of “critics of globalization3.” We could have randomly selected 
them from other sites or sources, but we focus on this page because it is one of the most 
popular  Web  2.0  pages,  and  because  it  has  a  high  reputation4.  On  the  other  hand,  we 
could have chosen another starting point, and it may have changed the keywords, but that 
was not relevant at the time of this study. The important thing in this phase was to have 
an  authoritative  news  source  as  baseline  to  find,  as  a  first  step,  keywords  connected  to 
globalization, and, as a second step, the idea of ‘globalization of agriculture’ as the main issue 
for the present illustration. We propose future research considering other starting points.

Based on a detailed study of site content, we selected main concepts from external links 
to  these  webpages  (B).  The  search  attributes  were  extracted  manually  from  the  website 
homepages and from the tag clouds or the topics that appear on the homepage. Following 
Rogers  and  Zelman  (2002),  we  decided  to  identify  these  keywords  through  associative 
reasoning, whereby we made educated guesses about relevant issues and finding key concepts 
commonly  linked  to  all  seed  websites.  Finally,  we  found  a  set  of  attributes  related  with 
agriculture – agriculture, food, organic, and GMO – that had been grouped along with the 
word globalization under the denomination of “globalization of agriculture”. Other different 
concepts were rejected at this step as they were not directly associated to agriculture, though 
could  be  linked  to  globalization.  The  decision  to  proceed  at  this  stage  with  the  manual 
extraction of these keywords, as opposed to using another automatic selection, was taken 
due to the importance that we give to the researcher in this stage, due to his/her expertise.

In a third stage (C), we gather the raw data sample of all the users’ records, URLs and tags 
available for the four tag pairs around the globalization main tag – globalization+agriculture; 
globalization+food;  globalization+organic;  globalization+GMO  –  identified  by  crawling 
through the social bookmarking website Delicious using a Perl-developed5 web crawler6. The 
data-gathering process from the four attributes covered the period between 22 April 2011

users on 1,077 URLs and 1,720 tags.

Finally, we developed a program in Haskell7 to reduce the amount of data (D) by cutting 
the URLs and using key words, including the identification of synonyms, and eliminating 
words with capital letters and derivatives such as words in plural. Both software programs, 
Perl  and  Haskell,  are  free  software  and  they  are  in  line  with  Web  2.0  philosophy.  The 
definitive data constituted 851 users, 526 URLs and 1,700 tags.

3.2. Analysis procedure
We are interested in computing the proportion of links preferentially created towards some 
kind of agents, relative to the proportion of these agents in the whole network (Barabási et 
al., 2002).

Node centrality, or the identification of the nodes that are more “central” than others, 
is a fundamental part of network analysis (Freeman, 1979; Bonacich, 1987; Borgatti, 2005; 
Borgatti et al., 2006). It is a network level property which gives a rough idea of the node’s 
social power based on how well it “connects” to the network.

The  literature  on  social  networks  conceptualizes  centrality  in  many  different  ways 
(Freeman, 1979). The degree of a node is the number of ties it has; specifically, the number 
of  direct  connections  individuals  have  with  others  in  the  group,  which  reflects  the  level 
of activity. The node with the highest degree exerts influence (or authority). The directed 
networks differentiate between In-degree and Out-degree. In-degree is the number of incoming 
ties  that  reflect  the  popularity  of  a  website.  As  a  result,  the  prominent,  well-connected 
members (those with a high degree of centrality) are usually the opinion leaders. Out-degree 
is the number of outgoing ties which determine if a particular user is an active or passive 
participant within the network.

Our aim is also to describe, in a simple manner, the resulting tag structure as a tag cloud 
that depicts the interests of Web users. In this way, social tags are able to provide visual 
representations of the conceptual structure of an issue, which is built upon the knowledge 
of individuals who belong to a large Web community.

In this section, we present some empirical analysis of the network for the globalization of 
agriculture and a first approach to the tags associated to URLs found after the retrieval of 
information process. The next section reviews that analysis with reference to the three elements 
that compose the network: users, URLs, and tags. We use Social Network Analysis techniques 
(with the help of the software Pajek, which is better for big series of data than others such 
as Ucinet) to build the network8 that we have called “globalization of agriculture”9. Through 
the connections among three key elements (Users write Tags to characterise URLs), different 
calculations were made. The following pages focus on two different approaches that allow us 
to find visible and invisible patterns when a Delicious bookmarking system’s user is simply 
using Delicious. In that sense, we discovered latent structures. Firstly, we pay attention to 
power that emerges from the network – main users and websites. In the second section, we 
focus on concrete tags that were elaborated by users describing URLs and their importance. 

4.1. centralization: Authority
Centralization is a network-level property that broadly measures the distribution of power 
or  prominence  amongst  actors  in  a  given  network  (Hanneman,  2005).  We  calculate 
centralization by first computing a particular node-level degree centrality. Each time a user 
labels  a  particular  URL,  the  intersection  between  user  and  URL  was  coded  by  1.  In  the 
“useràURL” directed network (Figure 3), we calculate the indegree from each URL as the 
sum of total inbound links, and, in the same way, the outdegree from each user as the sum 
of the outbound links.

Most important Users and URLs are placed in the middle of the Figure 3, where density 
of connections is higher.  Figure 4 shows the degree of variability in the website and user 

8 In this work, we use Social Network Analysis for calculating some measures, but we do not show the visualization of the network.

agriculture (see Table 1).

centralized within a few nodes because only 10 URLs from 526 (1.90%) account for 32.29% 
of  the  links  to  URLs10  and  only  10  users  from  851  (1.17%)  account  for  14.05%11.  This 
imbalance is not unusual given what we know about the long-tail distributions and the scale-
free properties of the web. The power law is a defining characteristic of large-scale networks 
such as the web (e.g. Barabási and Albert, 1999), which implies a high degree of network 
centralization; it also proffers the empirical starting point for the question:  Why?/ How 
come a few users and websites are better connected than the majority?

Table 2 shows the 10 most centralized websites, and we can see that nine are media-
based (online newspapers such as The New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, Washington 
Post, Financial Times, Reason, The Nation, Spiegel and The Economist).

11 These ten Users got 1,436 outbound links from a total of 10,219.

14

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1This table also shows the users with a greater degree of centrality. We observe that the 
user, mritiunjoy, plays a very important role in the network. We could take it a step further 
to know more about this central user and his possible connection to the links. For example, 
we discover on a Delicious web page that mritiunjoy joined Delicious on 12 March 2007, 
and, to date, he has 10,020 links and is following 38 users. However, on the internet, we 
also discover that mritiunjoy – Mritiunjoy Mohanty – is a professor at the Indian Institute of 
Management Calcutta, India, and his Research Interests are the Political Economy of growth 
and development.

Remembering Diani (2003), the analysis has identified valuable nodes (websites). Its 
value is not only due to the links that they receive (its instrumental nature) but also to 
the  profile  of  these  organizations  (newspapers  that  channel  big  quantities  of  resources 
–  information),  due  to  the  quality  of  the  links.  This  last  particularity  (quality  of  links), 
added to the first (instrumentality), determines that these URLs are central and have some 
authority. As a consequence, they could be relevant to produce currents of opinion. Most 
URLs bookmarked are singulars, because they could create or modify opinions. 

In addition, the results suggest that the most centralized users (those with the highest 
number  of  links)  do  that  because  they  have  other  interests  than  simply  bookmarking, 
sharing, or labelling a resource. 

4.2. node tags: users producing tags
In this section we explore the collective tag structure (excluding the key search words, such 
as globalization, agriculture, food and organic, and GMO) in an attempt to identify topics 
around our main theme. A natural approach to identifying the topical groupings in a tag 
network is to use tag clouds. Thus, Figure 5 shows a selection of highly descriptive keywords 
for the globalization of agriculture system in Delicious. Cluster keywords were automatically 
identified.

The clouds were produced with Wordle (Viégas et al., 2009), where the sizes of the terms 
in the tag clouds are proportional to the weights, with the top 25 highest weighted tags 
included. The resulting key topics were economics and the environment, which were the main 
keywords used by users to describe or characterise in Delicious the topic ‘globalization of 
agriculture’.

After  this  brief  description,  we  want  to  clarify  that  these  are  not  the  unique  results 
that  could  have  been  exposed  here,  after  the  complex  process  described  for  the  retrieval 
of information. We have chosen them as good examples that give sense to the operation 
of crawling big data, as first points of departure for knowing a bit more about the topic of 
globalization of agriculture, and for demonstrating the way that people describe and share 

15

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchwebsites about this issue through a modern and collaborative process of tagging. In the next 
section, a discussion about the results will be presented in order to know more about some 
alternative analyses, reflections, etc.

5. dIscussIon 
5.1. centrality and Power
Hanneman (2005) reminds us: “a very simple, but often very effective measure of an actor’s 
centrality and power potential is their degree”. In our case, as indegree concern URLs and as 
these represent some kind of collective actor, the determination of centrality measures make 
sense. Higher indegrees mean that the URLs are chosen by more users (they received more 
links). It is evident that the New York Times, in this network of globalization of agriculture 
in Delicious, greatly surpasses other URLs (with 1,203 inbound links, followed by the BBC 
website with 674 links). Most cited, recommended, or considered websites with regards to 
a topic occupy a central place and have an important role in the process of dissemination of 
news, events, trending topics, ideology, culture, etc. Knowing this previously hidden hierarchy 
is also very useful for different socioeconomic reasons. At the same time, this identification 
of key collective actors (represented here through URLs) allows a better comprehension of 
leadership, influence process, and power-related structures. For social practitioners, it is a 
good way to identify key informants in a community through whom disseminating useful 
and important information occurs.

Indegree in Table 2 also shows a very unequal distribution of power of the URLs cited by 
users in the topic of globalization of agriculture, represented by an important accumulation 
of inlinks.  Only 10 URLs represent an important, accumulated indegree). 

Regarding other actors in the networks, the users, for the identification of key actors 
that  disseminate  and  share  URLs,  as  the  previously  cited  Mritiunjoy,  it  is  important  to 
determine  from  where  key  elements  that  structure  the  network  emerge.  Is  it  possible  to 
explain why ‘that’ greatly important actor is in the network of globalization of agriculture? 
Key  actors  in  this  type  of  network  could  configure  and  reconfigure  the  evolution  of  the 
network, structure, and even manipulate the type of interchange of resources in Delicious or 
in similar bookmarking sites. 

Their prominence has something to say to social researchers, practitioners, etc.  Is it by 
chance? Are most prominent actors in the type of website like Delicious corresponding to a 
profile of very active and participative people? Do they usually work (or have as a hobby) in 
this area, which could explain the accumulation and tagging of so many URLs in Delicious? 
These and other questions could be answered in further steps of the research, depending on 
the concrete goals at each moment.

5.2. central tags: users producing tags
In the process of linking URLs in Delicious, the majority of users selected tags suggested 
by the website or added new tags in a creative way for describing or qualifying the URLs 
that they were recommended. A ‘tag cloud’ was built in order to have a visual approach to 
the language that was employed by users in their descriptions. As we have focused on the 
retrieval of information regarding the topic of globalization of agriculture, the question now 
is to wonder what we could know about this topic through the extracted tags. From a total 
of 1,700 tags, two words were the main ones, as most cited when users labelled URLs. It 
is important to note that each user could label a URL with an unlimited number of tags 
(average 12 tags per user, max 433 and min 2).  The most frequently used tags were the 
words: ‘economics’ (350 citations out of 1,700 tags, 20.6%) and ‘environment’ (273, 16%). 

16

Journal of Spatial and Organizational Dynamics, Volume I, Issue 1Other, very frequent tags were: sustainability (153), politics (152), economy (144), trade 
(131), business (99), poverty (97), culture (84), farming (84), africa (83), health (78), and 
development (76); in relative terms, these 13 tags represent one out of four labelled tags 
surrounding the topic (25.9%).

Discovering the importance of these words make us wonder not only of the reasons for 
the prominence of the first two tags regarding the globalization of agriculture but also for the 
rest. In addition, as 1,700 tags were also found qualifying and describing webpages regarding 
the topic of globalization of agriculture, some analyses are possible to know if some tags are 
used on an interchangeable basis, considered as synonyms, as was reported as one of the 
problems of collaborative tagging or the suggested vague-meaning problem (Kroski, 2005; 
Golder et al., 2006; Hope et al., 2007; Marchetti et al., 2007).

The same thing could be done regarding ‘term variations’. For instance, economy and 
economics are two important words in the topic of globalization of agriculture. Are these 
tags used in a similar or equivalent way at tagging? Why is the word economics sometimes 
used, and why, at other times, is economy used? Are they used in the same way at classifying 
the URLs?  

By limiting the analysis to a particular period of time, tags could be associated to the use of 
language at a particular moment. They could even be a good representation of the ideological 
and terminological approach to the topic in the international arena, at that moment, and 
be  useful  for  the  study  of  the  evolution  and  usage  of  language  in  a  topic  over  time.  On 
the other hand, the use of some tags at classifying URLs connected to the globalization of 
agriculture, and the distinction among users in the way they use some words as labels, could 
yield other types of results. Are scientific users  utilizing the same tags as other professionals 
or general users? Perhaps different scientists or other users produce different labels around 
the same topic. Perhaps the first people tagging a topic are influencing the following tags 
that are incorporated in Delicious, etc. Nevertheless, some of this analysis can be limited by 
the information available from users. Other possible studies, going into more depth, may 
retrieve the pages that were labelled and undertake a content analysis to determine what 
kind of content is labelled through concrete tags. This is a cognitive way to see how users 
summarize  and  represent  in  short  and  definite  words  what  could  be  broad  and  detailed 
content. It could be a way to see keywords that remind them about something. Through 
this, different applications could be suggested (for instance, in advertising, mobilizing, etc.). 
Although this article has been more focused on the retrieval and illustration aspects, we 
have not shown networks of tags linked by users or by URLs tagged by users; a complementary, 
detailed  analysis  could  help  to  identify  users  that  have  the  same  patterns  at  tagging  or 
URLs that were similarly labelled. This opens a door to study structural equivalences and 
considering, for instance, applications for particular types of users. 

Other  questions  emerge,  as  to  why  some  labels  are  present  but  not  others?  Is  it  a 
question  of  language  usage?  Is  it  a  question  of  traditions  at  tagging  in  Web  2.0?  Is  it  a 
fashion? Supposedly, if people use Delicious for collaborative reasons, tags must at least be 
understandable for other users, unless the user prioritizes their own usage of Delicious.

6. concLusIons And Future reseArch
The main objective of this paper was presenting a methodology to use big data from Web 
2.0 in social research. We had an interest in illustrating the extraction of data from a social 
bookmarking site (Delicious) and showing the type of results that this type of analysis could 
offer to social scientists. As it concerned big series of data crawled from a large social tagging 

17

Crawling Big Data in a New Frontier for Socioeconomic Researchsystem, the analysis could have an important impact in the discovering of latent patterns, 
which form the basis in order to provide effective recommendations to different actors. 

Our approach represents an important first step towards the development of empirical 
techniques  capable  of  automatically  differentiating  groups  of  individuals  with  common 
interests, and individuals who occupy a more central position. This research is also of interest 
to make recommendations on the knowledge base of individual interests.

In addition, our analysis offers a previously unavailable understanding in the definition 
of recommendation services. To be able to identify a short list of the most centralized users 
and ties is extremely useful for researchers attempting to understand a community of more 
than a thousand links. This is particularly important for researchers interested in formulating 
strategies  for  intervention  and  mobilization,  but  practitioners  and  companies  could  also 
make  use  of  this.  The  discovery  of  the  central  elements  in  a  network  (users  and  URLs) 
and the tags employed by users could be a key to the design of future strategies for the 
dissemination of messages, while also helping to achieve more success in communications, 
such as making use of important keywords to attract greater attention, etc. At the same 
time, if we know other interests of the users belonging to a network - through, for instance, 
other webpages that they link, and others tags that they label - we would be able to make 
recommendations, as done by other systems such as Amazon. 

With regards to the process of retrieval of information, the method presented here was 
somewhat complex but easy to apply if there is some computer knowledge. Nevertheless, 
working in interdisciplinary teams could greatly help to develop this kind of knowledge, as 
it was in our case. Though the technical process described was successful, improvements are 
necessary in the future, at least regarding the retrieval methods and the implementation of 
IR and RS techniques in social commerce and social media contexts.

On the other hand, the relation between users and resources, which is largely employed by 
traditional Recommender Systems, changes into a ternary relation between users, resources, 
and  tags,  which  is  more  complex  to  manage.  This  article  has  laid  the  first  stone  in  the 
difficult process of understanding and discovering patterns in the process that characterizes 
users  tagging  URLs  for  collaborative  reasons.  The  application  was  made  under  the  topic 
‘globalization of agriculture’.

Some of the first contributions in the area of globalization of agriculture were that tags 
used to describe URLs in the Delicious’s social bookmarking site were mostly concentrated 
around a few terms.  The approximation to this topic in the future through other bookmarking 
sites (for instance, dominated by Spanish-speaking users) will allow the researchers to know 
if the recommended URLs are again media-based or are even the same webpages; or, for 
instance, if there is a semantic change concerning tags used for describing and classifying 
URLs.

Lastly, we do not want to close the article without clarifying that researching the topic 
of globalization of agriculture in a systematic and broad way may require the consideration 
of other starting points for the retrieval of information, at least to compare and contrast 
results. This is a limitation of this work. Nevertheless, the search yielded 1,700 different tags 
that have been used in the period of only a month to qualify and describe the phenomenon. 
It is a large number of tags, but we found a great concentration of them, as the centrality 
measure  showed.  The  same  argument  could  be  made  regarding  URLs,  in  that  they  were 
extremely concentrated in mass media. Of course, other analysis in the future could be made 
with a longer period of time, along with other explorations. This is only a beginning.
