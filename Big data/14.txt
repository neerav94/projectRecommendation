Abstract.  Because  of  the  advent  of  smartphones  and  Internet  development, 
large quantities of  data are communicated indiscriminately, thereby  generating 
rapid  increases  in  data  traffic.  Particularly  in  the  context  of  social  commerce, 
with  its  enormous  amounts  of  information,  the  user  finds  it  difficult  to  locate 
information  needed.  Even  for  a  company  that  provides  this  service,  it  can  be 
difficult  to  ascertain  the  information  that  is  needed  by  the  user.  Thus,  other 
companies  have  arisen  to  provide  the  service  of  helping  those  companies 
extract the necessary information from the user data in order to meet the user’s 
needs. In this paper, we describe an efficient method of collecting big data for 
use by users of customized advertising services.

1      Introduction 

The  birth  of  the  Internet  inaugurated  the  modern  explosion  of  primary  data.  The 
Internet  provides  the  framework  for  the  world’s  information  exchange;  within  this 
framework,  information  is  replicated  and  can  be  indiscriminately  mass  produced, 
providing secondary data. This data expansion has created a surge in customer-related 
data associated with communication and trade channels, and these data play a role in 
data processing and analysis by companies.   

Now,  we  are  experiencing  an  explosion  of  secondary  data  [1].  The  cause  of  this 
new  data  explosion  is  the  generation  of  data  associated  with  the  diversification  and 
communication of the sources of primary data. Social networks and social commerce 
arose,  beginning  with  Facebook,  because  the  heart  of  the  Internet  is  big  data,  and 
mass-produced  data  about  relationships  between  users  enabled  applications  such  as 
Twitter  [2].  As  of  2011,  the  amount  of  digital  information  that  had  been  generated 
worldwide was 1.8 zettabytes. 1.8 zettabyte’s amount to be issued three statements on 
Twitter every minute without rest all of the people Republic of Korea 18 million years. 
In this way, a great deal of information and inestimable numbers of data are produced, 
diffusing  into  the  digital  economy  [3],  [4].  Furthermore,  because  of  existing  data 
management  and  analysis  methods,  unaffordably  immense  quantities  of  data  are 
generated. Therefore, as the quantity of data increases rapidly, not only are techniques

2.1      Amazon 

Amazon.com  is  an  international  e-commerce  company  headquartered  in  the  United 
States (in Seattle, Washington); it  is the largest online  shopping brokerage company 
in  the  world.  Amazon  started  as  an  online  bookstore  and  advanced  to  various  other 
fields through a business expansion in 1997.  For big data analysis in Amazon, cloud 
computing  technology  is  used.  Cloud  computing  integrates  IT  resources  with  a  very 
large  cloud  server  to  provide  computer  resources  to  individuals,  who  only  require 
online access to an Amazon cloud drive account to utilize it. Service is provided only 
to registered devices, and it is possible to register up to eight devices, regardless of the 
type of device. A web browser can connect to any device, but it is also possible to be 
connected  to  the  storage  devices  via  Android  applications.  Amazon  has  maintained 
the  highest  level  of  customer  satisfaction  in  the  e-commerce  industry  through  its 
thoroughly customer-centric business development.   

Amazon Web Services (AWS) allows any company to save information and to run 
software  on  Amazon’s  computer.  Companies  pay  only  for  the  capacity  used  when 
using cloud services. This system is flexible enough to deliver reliable, fast response, 
even with the tremendous variation in traffic that exists.

either  “batch  mode”  or  “streaming  mode”  format.  The  basic  concept  of  the  GCD  is 
that it handles the big data optimization, distribution, and scheduling for the user, who 
remains  in  charge  of  all  the  peripheral  functions  such  as  monitoring  the  GCD,  in 
exchange for being able to concentrate on big data analysis applications.

3      Main Discourse 

In order to efficiently collect big data, we have developed a mobile social advertising 
platform that sends advertisements and coupons to the surrounding commercial area, 
based  on  information  about  users’  locations.  Users  can  use  the  social  advertising 
platform to collect data for multiple users, analyze the results, and provide customized 
service based on their findings. In order to collect the data, tables in the database store 
interests of each user, allowing views that are designed to be configured (see Fig. 1). 
By configuring the tables in the database, it is possible to instruct it to store only the 
data  that  are  of  interest,  thereby  shortening  the  time  needed  for  further  analysis  as 
well as reducing the space needed to store the data.

3.1      Collection of User Queries 

One way to learn the simplest interest of the user is to collect and analyze user search 
queries.  By  using  the  search  keywords  collected,  it  is  possible  to  simplify  the  data 
mining  using  big  data  analysis  techniques.  Data  mining  of  the  stored  data  can  be 
performed  on  a  large  scale,  systematically  and  automatically  finding  the  statistical 
rules and search query patterns of each user by searching the common words stored in 
the  database.  The  extracted  words,  in  themselves,  reflect  the  interests  of  the  user. 
Additionally,  by  measuring  the  frequency  of  search  queries,  a  user’s  interests  and 
conclusions can be determined with high confidence. 

3.2      Collection of User Connection Durations 

By  collecting  the  lengths  of  time  users  are  connected  to  their  subjects  of  interest  in 
social commerce, it is possible to gain an understanding of their interests. In using the 
ASP,  they  also  record  the  start  time  and  the  disconnection  time  for  the  session  in 
which they accessed areas of interest. Subtracting the start time from the end time, it 
is  possible  to  measure  the  time  the  user  spent  connected  to  that  category.  Only  by 
measuring  the  connection  time  is  it  possible  to  determine  the  users’  interest.  If  a 
category  attracts  long  stays,  it  means  that  users  are  finding  more  things  of  interest 
there. 

3.3      Collection of User Access Counts 

By  analyzing  the  number  of  accesses  in  the  general  access  log,  it  is  possible  to 
measure how many users are accessing a page. Thus, by saving the user and the page

1      Introduction 

The  birth  of  the  Internet  inaugurated  the  modern  explosion  of  primary  data.  The 
Internet  provides  the  framework  for  the  world’s  information  exchange;  within  this 
framework,  information  is  replicated  and  can  be  indiscriminately  mass  produced, 
providing secondary data. This data expansion has created a surge in customer-related 
data associated with communication and trade channels, and these data play a role in 
data processing and analysis by companies.   

Now,  we  are  experiencing  an  explosion  of  secondary  data  [1].  The  cause  of  this 
new  data  explosion  is  the  generation  of  data  associated  with  the  diversification  and 
communication of the sources of primary data. Social networks and social commerce 
arose,  beginning  with  Facebook,  because  the  heart  of  the  Internet  is  big  data,  and 
mass-produced  data  about  relationships  between  users  enabled  applications  such  as 
Twitter  [2].  As  of  2011,  the  amount  of  digital  information  that  had  been  generated 
worldwide was 1.8 zettabytes. 1.8 zettabyte’s amount to be issued three statements on 
Twitter every minute without rest all of the people Republic of Korea 18 million years. 
In this way, a great deal of information and inestimable numbers of data are produced, 
diffusing  into  the  digital  economy  [3],  [4].  Furthermore,  because  of  existing  data 
management  and  analysis  methods,  unaffordably  immense  quantities  of  data  are 
generated. Therefore, as the quantity of data increases rapidly, not only are techniques

users on the Internet [5].   

In  developed  countries  such  as  the  United  States  and  Europe,  with  their  big  data 
companies, interest is already rising and investments are increasing in order to obtain 
useful  information  of  value  to  society  and  humanity.  Companies  can  analyze  user 
preferences,  making  it  possible  to  target  their  marketing;  thus,  it  is  necessary  to 
improve  the  quality  of  service  [6].  Therefore,  in  this  paper,  we  describe  how  to 
efficiently collect the myriad data needed for big data analysis.

2.1      Amazon 

Amazon.com  is  an  international  e-commerce  company  headquartered  in  the  United 
States (in Seattle, Washington); it  is the largest online  shopping brokerage company 
in  the  world.  Amazon  started  as  an  online  bookstore  and  advanced  to  various  other 
fields through a business expansion in 1997.  For big data analysis in Amazon, cloud 
computing  technology  is  used.  Cloud  computing  integrates  IT  resources  with  a  very 
large  cloud  server  to  provide  computer  resources  to  individuals,  who  only  require 
online access to an Amazon cloud drive account to utilize it. Service is provided only 
to registered devices, and it is possible to register up to eight devices, regardless of the 
type of device. A web browser can connect to any device, but it is also possible to be 
connected  to  the  storage  devices  via  Android  applications.  Amazon  has  maintained 
the  highest  level  of  customer  satisfaction  in  the  e-commerce  industry  through  its 
thoroughly customer-centric business development.   

Amazon Web Services (AWS) allows any company to save information and to run 
software  on  Amazon’s  computer.  Companies  pay  only  for  the  capacity  used  when 
using cloud services. This system is flexible enough to deliver reliable, fast response, 
even with the tremendous variation in traffic that exists. 

2.2      Google 

Google  is  a  U.S.  multinational  company  whose  main  business  areas  are  cloud 
computing  and  advertising.  Google’s  big  data  analysis  service  is  called  the  “Google 
Cloud Dataflow” (GCD). GCD resides in Google’s cloud platform and is linked to the 
available  big  data  analysis  services,  and  it  can  process  a  large  quantity  of  data  in 
either  “batch  mode”  or  “streaming  mode”  format.  The  basic  concept  of  the  GCD  is 
that it handles the big data optimization, distribution, and scheduling for the user, who 
remains  in  charge  of  all  the  peripheral  functions  such  as  monitoring  the  GCD,  in 
exchange for being able to concentrate on big data analysis applications.

eBay is a multinational company in the United States that provides C2C services via 
the  Internet.  eBay  can  take  advantage  of  predictive  analytics  using  SAP  HANA, 
thereby  expanding  as  a  seller  of  business  and  reducing  the  burden  of  its  business 
analysts, who are working to drive the growth of the eBay marketplace. SAP HANA 
is  a  platform  for  real-time  analysis  and  applications,  a  next-generation  solution  for 
real-time  business.  Data  can  be  queried  and  analyzed  by  all  users,  enabling  support 
for  business  insights  that  require  a  large  quantity  of  data  containing  detailed 
information starting from the moment a business transaction occurs. SAP HANA may 
be 500 index the best model and analyzed automatically select,  with 100% accuracy 
and 97% reliability, and to determine the actual positive responders. Thanks  to eBay 
analysts,  their  automated  system  can  reliably  detect  the  best  time  to  invest  in  a 
strategic  business,  so  that  eBay  can  allow  sellers  to  focus  on  the  items  that  buyers 
need. 

3      Main Discourse 

In order to efficiently collect big data, we have developed a mobile social advertising 
platform that sends advertisements and coupons to the surrounding commercial area, 
based  on  information  about  users’  locations.  Users  can  use  the  social  advertising 
platform to collect data for multiple users, analyze the results, and provide customized 
service based on their findings. In order to collect the data, tables in the database store 
interests of each user, allowing views that are designed to be configured (see Fig. 1). 
By configuring the tables in the database, it is possible to instruct it to store only the 
data  that  are  of  interest,  thereby  shortening  the  time  needed  for  further  analysis  as 
well as reducing the space needed to store the data. 

Advanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.94 (Networking and Communication 2015)38Copyright © 2015 SERSCFig. 1.    Database design. 

 

3.1      Collection of User Queries 

One way to learn the simplest interest of the user is to collect and analyze user search 
queries.  By  using  the  search  keywords  collected,  it  is  possible  to  simplify  the  data 
mining  using  big  data  analysis  techniques.  Data  mining  of  the  stored  data  can  be 
performed  on  a  large  scale,  systematically  and  automatically  finding  the  statistical 
rules and search query patterns of each user by searching the common words stored in 
the  database.  The  extracted  words,  in  themselves,  reflect  the  interests  of  the  user. 
Additionally,  by  measuring  the  frequency  of  search  queries,  a  user’s  interests  and 
conclusions can be determined with high confidence. 

3.2      Collection of User Connection Durations 

By  collecting  the  lengths  of  time  users  are  connected  to  their  subjects  of  interest  in 
social commerce, it is possible to gain an understanding of their interests. In using the 
ASP,  they  also  record  the  start  time  and  the  disconnection  time  for  the  session  in 
which they accessed areas of interest. Subtracting the start time from the end time, it 
is  possible  to  measure  the  time  the  user  spent  connected  to  that  category.  Only  by 
measuring  the  connection  time  is  it  possible  to  determine  the  users’  interest.  If  a 
category  attracts  long  stays,  it  means  that  users  are  finding  more  things  of  interest 
there. 

3.3      Collection of User Access Counts 

By  analyzing  the  number  of  accesses  in  the  general  access  log,  it  is  possible  to 
measure how many users are accessing a page. Thus, by saving the user and the page 

Advanced Science and Technology Letters Vol.94 (Networking and Communication 2015)Copyright © 2015 SERSC39that was accessed, it is possible to ascertain a user’s interest by extracting the theme 
of the stored page. In this manner, a session can be analyzed according to the number 
of accesses. However, if the page theme is recorded for the session, it is not necessary 
to save the actual database or the page URL; the subject matter has been registered in 
the  session,  along  with  the  number  of  connections,  allowing  us  to  sort  these  topics 
according to their frequency of access. The more frequently a subject is accessed, the 
more interest the user has demonstrated in that subject. 

4      Conclusion 

Currently,  as  greater  and  greater  amounts  of  information  are  exchanged  over  the 
Internet,  a  large  quantity  of  data  is  rapidly  enough  never  to  understand  the 
development  of  smart  phones  and  wireless  Internet.  This  allows  users  to  obtain 
information  through  the  Internet,  though  from  the  company’s  perspective,  it  is  a 
difficult  challenge  to  find  the  data  necessary  to  provide  the  information,  i.e.,  to 
provide a service that matches the user with the information requested. The surge of 
social  commerce  in  particular  points  out  that  “hard  to  use”  is  out  by  complex 
advertising.  Therefore,  a  need  arose  to  provide  services  to  meet  users’  needs,  and 
hence  the  term  “targeted  marketing”  appeared.  In  order  to  fulfill  this  demand  to 
provide customized services to analyze users’ preferences, it is necessary  to have an 
accurate understanding of their interests. In this paper, we have proposed a scheme for 
collecting  only  the  user  data  necessary  to  provide  a  specific  service.  The  aim  is  to 
collect  the  data  that  allow  us  to  grasp  the  users’  exact  interests  by  analysis  of 
connection  counts,  connection  times,  and  most  frequently  accessed  topic  (search 
query or web page or category). By collecting only those data that match the purpose, 
the  phenomenon  of  data  overload  is  avoided,  and  it  is  expected  that  more  accurate 
analysis can be achieved.   

In  order  to  improve  the  accuracy  of  intensive  analysis,  we  intend  to  investigate 
additional  types  of  collection  methods.  As  data  traffic  is  reduced,  it  is  expected  that 
user friendliness will increase.

Abstract.  Because  of  the  advent  of  smartphones  and  Internet  development, 
large quantities of  data are communicated indiscriminately, thereby  generating 
rapid  increases  in  data  traffic.  Particularly  in  the  context  of  social  commerce, 
with  its  enormous  amounts  of  information,  the  user  finds  it  difficult  to  locate 
information  needed.  Even  for  a  company  that  provides  this  service,  it  can  be 
difficult  to  ascertain  the  information  that  is  needed  by  the  user.  Thus,  other 
companies  have  arisen  to  provide  the  service  of  helping  those  companies 
extract the necessary information from the user data in order to meet the user’s 
needs. In this paper, we describe an efficient method of collecting big data for 
use by users of customized advertising services.
