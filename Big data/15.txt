Abstract.  Small  and  medium-sized  manufacturing  enterprises  are  highly 
vulnerable  to  competition  compared  to  conglomerates,  as  not  many  of  them 
have  adopted  Manufacturing  Execution  Systems  (MES)  and  do  not  have 
sufficient IT specialists and investment funds. In this research, therefore, a Big 
data  analysis  system  model  that  can  be  used  on  site  was  developed  that  is 
practical and flexible enough to be adopted easily, thus enabling the use of Big 
data technology to consolidate the competitiveness of small and medium-sized 
manufacturing  business.  The  on-site  big  data  analysis  system  model  saves  the 
internet  data  into  the  proper  Data  Store  according  to  their  usage  purpose  after 
collection,  including  Excel  data  on  the  site  of  small  and  medium-sized 
manufacturing  enterprises,  typical  and  atypical  files,  sensor  Data,  and 
news/blogs/SNS  data.  The  saved  data  supports  decision  making  with  strong 
visual  effects,  and  intuitive  data  detectable  network  visualization  technologies 
which  are  offered  by  various  charts  through  the  library  of  open  source  data 
visualization,  D3.js.  In  addition,  the  model  shows  practical  adaptation  and 
flexibility  through  a  customized  plug-in  method  that  can  be  adjusted  to  the  IT 
environment of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises.

As a result, it is difficult to analyze the rate of operation of manufacturing process, 
production yield, and product quality, as well as to find the factors that cause product 
defects and abnormal phenomenon. It is also difficult to identify customer and market 
needs  because  there  is  no  connection  with  external  data,  and  there  is  not  enough 
investment being  made in IT and IT specialists.  As  can be seen,  small and  medium-

3    Big data analysis system on site 

In this research, a platform structure is developed that can be adopted to analyze data 
flexibly on a company  site by automatically collecting, refining, and processing data 
of  a  manufacturing  enterprise  on  site  (typical,  atypical).  This  system  provides  an 
effective  decision  making  support  system  by  offering  a  correlation  between 
information  and  multi-dimensional  analysis  base,  and  maximizing  system  utilization 
through an intuitive and user-friendly User Interface. It also applies diverse visualized 
technology considering the executive group and site staff of small and medium-sized 
manufacturing enterprises   

The  big  data  analysis  system  on  site,  which  is  developed  in  this  research,  is 
processed through an ETL (Extract Transform Loading) process that extracts, refines 
and collects data using the DB function of each system which exists in ERP, MIS, and 
so  on.  Data  that  is  recorded  atypically  on  site  (ex.  Excel),  is  extracted,  refined,  and 
collected  as  typical  data  by  the  ODE  (Office  Data  Excavation)  module  that 
automatically recognizes the pattern of the data. The digital information is saved in a 
NoSQL  storage  after  an  indexing  process  for  various  statistic  analyses,  the  stored 
digital  information  can  be  analyzed  in  real-time  series,  visualized  in  Straight  Table, 
Pivot  Table  or  diverse  Chart  formations  by  each  index,  and  calculated  with  various 
Aggregation  functions.  The  information  that  has  the  same  mutual  Relation  as  the 
information stored in the existing R-DB is saved in Graph-based NoSQL storage after 
modeling and analyzing relations when it is collected. Ultimately, the information that 
is  stored  in  Graph-based  modeling  provides  an  intuitive  and  user-friendly  analysis 
tool visualized in Network format.

This research has developed a “Big data analysis system model on site” that collects 
and  saves  data  from  the  structural  data  (typical,  atypical,  and  semi-typical)  and 
internal  information  systems  of  small  and  medium-sized  manufacturing  enterprises. 
Furthermore,  it  offers  a  base  for  decision  making  support,  main  index  (quality, 
obstacle, sales and so on)  monitoring  that is refined and analyzed by  using Big data 
technology. In my opinion, the newly developed system in research will aid effective 
decision making, enhance the management environment of a company, and accelerate 
the development of a production system that fits a company’s own manufacturing.

Abstract.  Small  and  medium-sized  manufacturing  enterprises  are  highly 
vulnerable  to  competition  compared  to  conglomerates,  as  not  many  of  them 
have  adopted  Manufacturing  Execution  Systems  (MES)  and  do  not  have 
sufficient IT specialists and investment funds. In this research, therefore, a Big 
data  analysis  system  model  that  can  be  used  on  site  was  developed  that  is 
practical and flexible enough to be adopted easily, thus enabling the use of Big 
data technology to consolidate the competitiveness of small and medium-sized 
manufacturing  business.  The  on-site  big  data  analysis  system  model  saves  the 
internet  data  into  the  proper  Data  Store  according  to  their  usage  purpose  after 
collection,  including  Excel  data  on  the  site  of  small  and  medium-sized 
manufacturing  enterprises,  typical  and  atypical  files,  sensor  Data,  and 
news/blogs/SNS  data.  The  saved  data  supports  decision  making  with  strong 
visual  effects,  and  intuitive  data  detectable  network  visualization  technologies 
which  are  offered  by  various  charts  through  the  library  of  open  source  data 
visualization,  D3.js.  In  addition,  the  model  shows  practical  adaptation  and 
flexibility  through  a  customized  plug-in  method  that  can  be  adjusted  to  the  IT 
environment of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises.

1      Introduction 

Today,  companies  in  the  rapidly  changing  business  environment  are  constantly 
working to optimize their external processes through collaboration, as well as helping 
their internal processes to effectively and quickly respond to market demand in order 
to secure competiveness [1].         

However,  it  is  difficult  for  small  and  medium-sized  manufacturing  businesses  to 
follow this trend. Compared with larger conglomerates, most small and medium-sized 
manufacturers  have  not  adopted  Manufacturing  Execution  System  (MES),  and  in 
many  cases  the  field  data  is  not  being  saved.  As  most  of  the  existing  field  data  is

performed manually. 

As a result, it is difficult to analyze the rate of operation of manufacturing process, 
production yield, and product quality, as well as to find the factors that cause product 
defects and abnormal phenomenon. It is also difficult to identify customer and market 
needs  because  there  is  no  connection  with  external  data,  and  there  is  not  enough 
investment being  made in IT and IT specialists.  As  can be seen,  small and  medium-
sized  manufacturing  enterprises  are  inevitably  vulnerable  in  competition  compared 
with  conglomerates.  For  this  reason,  it  is  planned  in  this  research  to  develop  a 
customized  analysis  solution  for  small  and  medium-sized  manufacturing  enterprises, 
which  are  vulnerable  compared  to  conglomerates.  Developing  customized  (plugin) 
solutions  of  companies’  diverse  environment  and  needs  for  having  easy  application 
and  flexibility.  And  make  it  possible  to  connect  internal  and  external  data  by 
developing 
internet  data 
collection/analyzing system. In addition, the solution can support decision-making by 
providing visual effects through the library of open source data visualization, D3.js.

system  and 

The  final  aim  of  this  research  technology  development  is  to  contribute  to 
enhancing the competitiveness of small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises 
by  developing  a  combined/related  analysis  and  visualization  system  of  all  the  data 
needed to strengthen a company’s competitiveness, which is cost efficient and enables 
easier adoption and management.       

2    Related Works 

Major  global  SI  and  solution  business-centered  IT  companies  such  as  EMC,  IBM, 
ORACLE,  SAP,  GOOGLE,  and  MICROSOFT  are  focusing  on  solution  and  core 
technology development to enable early dominance in the Big data market. M&A and 
technical  cooperation  of  related  business  for  technology  development  were  ongoing 
until 2011, and related services and solutions  were being launched in earnest starting 
in 2012. IT service companies run Big data businesses or develop the platform of Big 
data  analysis,  and  social  network  analyzing  companies  work  on  various  Big  data 
businesses for ordinary people and companies [2][3].   

Most Big data sales originate from huge IT companies like IBM and HP, and Big 
data solution companies such as Vertica and Cloudera. It is considered that the size of 
Big data market may increase at a 58% compound annual growth rate(CAGR) over 5 
years, from 5 billion dollars in 2012 to 53 billion dollars in 2017 [4]. 

IDC,  an  IT  market  analysis  and  consulting  institute,  predicts  that  the  scale  of  the 
Big data market may increase from 3.2 billion dollars in 2010 to 16.9 billion dollars in 
2015. This is a CAGR of 40%, which is seven times higher than the growth rate of the 
overall  ICT  market.  Significantly,  it  is  expected  that  the  technology  and  service 
market for Big data in the Asia-Pacific area (except Japan) may show a high  growth 
rate, with annual average growth of 46.8% in the next 5 years [5]. 

In the rapidly changing era of smart digital, the direction is changing from how to 
predict and prepare for the era of Big data, to how to process and use it. The series of 
techniques  of  saving·collecting·managing·distributing·analyzing  Big  data  are  called

models  through  Big  data  analysis  and  are  using  it  successfully,  and  have  also 
strengthened the capabilities of Big data processing technology [6]. 

Global  competitors  already  have  achieved  a  high  level  of  effectiveness.  In 
particular, it is necessary to develop a new business model that is able to create value 
through  Big  data  analysis  in  diverse  areas  by  benchmarking  the  success  case  of 
Hadoop, an open-source based Big data platform. [7] 

3    Big data analysis system on site 

In this research, a platform structure is developed that can be adopted to analyze data 
flexibly on a company  site by automatically collecting, refining, and processing data 
of  a  manufacturing  enterprise  on  site  (typical,  atypical).  This  system  provides  an 
effective  decision  making  support  system  by  offering  a  correlation  between 
information  and  multi-dimensional  analysis  base,  and  maximizing  system  utilization 
through an intuitive and user-friendly User Interface. It also applies diverse visualized 
technology considering the executive group and site staff of small and medium-sized 
manufacturing enterprises   

The  big  data  analysis  system  on  site,  which  is  developed  in  this  research,  is 
processed through an ETL (Extract Transform Loading) process that extracts, refines 
and collects data using the DB function of each system which exists in ERP, MIS, and 
so  on.  Data  that  is  recorded  atypically  on  site  (ex.  Excel),  is  extracted,  refined,  and 
collected  as  typical  data  by  the  ODE  (Office  Data  Excavation)  module  that 
automatically recognizes the pattern of the data. The digital information is saved in a 
NoSQL  storage  after  an  indexing  process  for  various  statistic  analyses,  the  stored 
digital  information  can  be  analyzed  in  real-time  series,  visualized  in  Straight  Table, 
Pivot  Table  or  diverse  Chart  formations  by  each  index,  and  calculated  with  various 
Aggregation  functions.  The  information  that  has  the  same  mutual  Relation  as  the 
information stored in the existing R-DB is saved in Graph-based NoSQL storage after 
modeling and analyzing relations when it is collected. Ultimately, the information that 
is  stored  in  Graph-based  modeling  provides  an  intuitive  and  user-friendly  analysis 
tool visualized in Network format.
