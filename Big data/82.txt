Abstract: 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. In this paper, we highlight the costs and benefits of 
the application of these technologies to audience research through specific case studies set 
within varied museum environments. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 
experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. This paper also discusses the methodological, ethical and 
practical challenges emerging from the use of these technologies in the field as well as the 
limits of their application.

well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the

appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and

activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).  
 
of the study and what their participation in it would involve. Forty-six families were 
approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main

data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.

landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.  
 
technical factors such as visibility of satellites (the more satellites are visible the higher 

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and

accuracy can be achieved), the quality of the receiver chip, atmospheric conditions, and sun 
activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).  
 
of the study and what their participation in it would involve. Forty-six families were 
approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main 
entrance. Participating families were asked to complete a PMM that was used to gather 
data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.

Having completed the pre-visit PMM, families were then provided with a 

 
 
smartphone that was used to record their location for the full duration of their visit, which 
could last up to approximately five hours. Due to the fact that at the time smartphones 
were not as common as today, we opted to provide the same model device to all families so 
that the recorded location data would be of comparable quality. Specifically, we used the 
Openmoko Neo smartphone as our logging device integrating a precise Assisted-GPS unit 
with EGNOS functionality that achieves best accuracy in this locality. Tracking software was 
already installed and operational and the device was placed in a soft pouch that could be 
safely attached to a belt or placed inside a pocket or handbag. Visitor location was logged 
every second by a GPS unit integrated in the smartphone in order to have as detailed a 
record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

Abstract: 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. In this paper, we highlight the costs and benefits of 
the application of these technologies to audience research through specific case studies set 
within varied museum environments. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 
experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. This paper also discusses the methodological, ethical and 
practical challenges emerging from the use of these technologies in the field as well as the

1. Introduction 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research1 methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. Indeed, the daily routine of most contemporary 
researchers would involve the use of databases and spreadsheets to manage and tabulate

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively 
recent additions to this set of tools and have further extended our ability to reach actual 
and potential audiences and improve the accuracy and detail of record keeping. Today, a 
new generation of mobile technology is rapidly becoming affordable and offers the 
opportunity to further develop the technology toolkit of audience research. Its core 
ingredients are the capability to automatically capture location and other sensor2 input from 
commodity consumer devices carried by visitors and use this information to conduct 
analyses through a new generation of machine learning and visualization techniques.  
 
the visitor at specific time intervals. In this way, it becomes possible to track visitors as they 
move through an exhibition or site without the active involvement of a researcher. There is 
however great variation in the capabilities of different technology alternatives to achieve 
this: when outdoors, visitors carrying a smartphone can be located using GPS to within a few 
meters of their actual position. When indoors, wireless networking infrastructure can be 
used to achieve the same goal also using the visitors’ mobile phone but at coarser accuracy. 
Location and time are the attributes of a visit that can be most easily recorded but are by no 
means the only: mobile sensing technology can also be used to infer the activities that the 
visitors are involved in, the ambience of their immediate surroundings, and in some cases 
their emotional and cognitive responses to their museum experience.  
Moreover, a current trend in information technology is towards consumerization in 
 
what is becoming known as the BYOD (Bring your Own Device) approach. BYOD advocates 
that IT in general and mobile sensing technology specifically is increasingly incorporated in 
consumer devices such as the mobile phones carried by visitors, and that such devices can 
be employed for the delivery of systems and applications offered by museums. For example, 
it is no longer necessary to provide a hardware-based audio or electronic guide to visitors 
but a museum can instead employ an app on the visitor’s own smartphone offering the 
same functionality thus significantly extending the availability of such applications. Indeed, 
according to a recent study by the Survey of American Alliance of Museums and the 
Museums Association in the UK, approximately half of the population in the USA and 
Western Europe are already users of smartphones (Fusion Research + Analytics 2012). These 
smartphones can also be employed to conduct audience research capturing rich data sets 
that are amenable to a new generation of analysis techniques, commonly referred to as Big 
Data analytics (Barton and Court 2012), which can provide new insights on the underlying 
patterns of behaviour.

environments, each employing technology that matches their particular requirements and 
characteristics. In each case, we also show examples of how the data has been analysed 
using modern Big Data techniques. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 

In this paper, we highlight the advantages and limitations of the application of these

experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the 
methodological, ethical and practical challenges emerging from the use of these 
technologies in the field as well as the limits of their application. Throughout, we are 
mindful that technology is only the enabler and that in many cases such tools would be one 
of several alternatives available to researchers who must make choices guided by 
appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved.

under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time.

corresponding to the café area at the London Zoo. The statistics have been automatically calculated 
and displayed by the Audience Focus Analytics system. 
 
An alternative way to visually represent space occupancy is through the heatmap (cf. Figure 
3), a technique that superimposes colour intensities on locations to represent the relative 
length of visitor dwell times at those locations. Heatmaps are a common technique in Big 
Data analytics due to their effectiveness to visually communicate the relative frequency by 
which specific places are used and can help to quickly identify places of intense interest for 
visitors such as “hot” exhibits and how individuals group around them. For example, a quick 
visual inspection of Figure 3 reveals the main areas where the particular family spent most

able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main 
entrance. Participating families were asked to complete a PMM that was used to gather 
data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.

Having completed the pre-visit PMM, families were then provided with a 

 
 
smartphone that was used to record their location for the full duration of their visit, which 
could last up to approximately five hours. Due to the fact that at the time smartphones 
were not as common as today, we opted to provide the same model device to all families so 
that the recorded location data would be of comparable quality. Specifically, we used the 
Openmoko Neo smartphone as our logging device integrating a precise Assisted-GPS unit 
with EGNOS functionality that achieves best accuracy in this locality. Tracking software was 
already installed and operational and the device was placed in a soft pouch that could be 
safely attached to a belt or placed inside a pocket or handbag. Visitor location was logged 
every second by a GPS unit integrated in the smartphone in order to have as detailed a 
record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time.

corresponding to the café area at the London Zoo. The statistics have been automatically calculated 
and displayed by the Audience Focus Analytics system. 
 
An alternative way to visually represent space occupancy is through the heatmap (cf. Figure 
3), a technique that superimposes colour intensities on locations to represent the relative 
length of visitor dwell times at those locations. Heatmaps are a common technique in Big 
Data analytics due to their effectiveness to visually communicate the relative frequency by 
which specific places are used and can help to quickly identify places of intense interest for 
visitors such as “hot” exhibits and how individuals group around them. For example, a quick 
visual inspection of Figure 3 reveals the main areas where the particular family spent most

of their time. This technique has also been used to analyses visitor traces at the site of the 
Minoan palace and city of Zakros, Crete, Greece (Chrysanthi  2012).

3. Coarse-grain Tracking Indoors 
GPS is an ideal solution for tracking and timing in many outdoors situations but building 
structures and the presence of large reflective surfaces in relatively close proximity to the 
receiver adversely affect the satellite signal. As a result, GPS measurements become 
unreliable in interior spaces and in most cases completely unusable so that alternatives 
must be considered. The implication is that it becomes necessary to deploy purpose-specific 
infrastructure usually at significant cost including installation, calibration and general 
maintenance and operation. Cost is directly related to the desired precision and accuracy, 
the exact exhibition characteristics and layout, and the types and sizes of the exhibits 
present. For a medium-sized museum expenditure would typically range from a few 
thousands to several hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
 
Tate Modern in the UK has used indoors location-sensing technology since the early 
2000s primarily as a means to adapt content presented by its multimedia guide and related 
mobile apps (Wilson 2004). The system employs the gallery’s wi-fi network and has been 
quite successful with visitors through applications such as the Magic Tate Ball, a location-
based game that promotes the exploration of the gallery’s collections. However, the 
technology has severe limitations in that it can only provide room-level accuracy. For this 
reason it has only been employed in rudimentary ways for audience research primarily to 
collect app usage and popularity data.

1. Introduction 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research1 methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. Indeed, the daily routine of most contemporary 
researchers would involve the use of databases and spreadsheets to manage and tabulate

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively 
recent additions to this set of tools and have further extended our ability to reach actual 
and potential audiences and improve the accuracy and detail of record keeping. Today, a 
new generation of mobile technology is rapidly becoming affordable and offers the 
opportunity to further develop the technology toolkit of audience research. Its core 
ingredients are the capability to automatically capture location and other sensor2 input from 
commodity consumer devices carried by visitors and use this information to conduct 
analyses through a new generation of machine learning and visualization techniques.  
 
the visitor at specific time intervals. In this way, it becomes possible to track visitors as they 
move through an exhibition or site without the active involvement of a researcher. There is 
however great variation in the capabilities of different technology alternatives to achieve 
this: when outdoors, visitors carrying a smartphone can be located using GPS to within a few 
meters of their actual position. When indoors, wireless networking infrastructure can be 
used to achieve the same goal also using the visitors’ mobile phone but at coarser accuracy. 
Location and time are the attributes of a visit that can be most easily recorded but are by no 
means the only: mobile sensing technology can also be used to infer the activities that the 
visitors are involved in, the ambience of their immediate surroundings, and in some cases 
their emotional and cognitive responses to their museum experience.  
Moreover, a current trend in information technology is towards consumerization in 
 
what is becoming known as the BYOD (Bring your Own Device) approach. BYOD advocates 
that IT in general and mobile sensing technology specifically is increasingly incorporated in 
consumer devices such as the mobile phones carried by visitors, and that such devices can 
be employed for the delivery of systems and applications offered by museums. For example, 
it is no longer necessary to provide a hardware-based audio or electronic guide to visitors 
but a museum can instead employ an app on the visitor’s own smartphone offering the 
same functionality thus significantly extending the availability of such applications. Indeed, 
according to a recent study by the Survey of American Alliance of Museums and the 
Museums Association in the UK, approximately half of the population in the USA and 
Western Europe are already users of smartphones (Fusion Research + Analytics 2012). These 
smartphones can also be employed to conduct audience research capturing rich data sets 
that are amenable to a new generation of analysis techniques, commonly referred to as Big 
Data analytics (Barton and Court 2012), which can provide new insights on the underlying 
patterns of behaviour. 
 
technologies to audience research through specific case studies set within varied museum 
environments, each employing technology that matches their particular requirements and 
characteristics. In each case, we also show examples of how the data has been analysed 
using modern Big Data techniques. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 

In this paper, we highlight the advantages and limitations of the application of these

experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the 
methodological, ethical and practical challenges emerging from the use of these 
technologies in the field as well as the limits of their application. Throughout, we are 
mindful that technology is only the enabler and that in many cases such tools would be one 
of several alternatives available to researchers who must make choices guided by 
appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.  
 
technical factors such as visibility of satellites (the more satellites are visible the higher 

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and 

 

Page 272

                                        May 2014 

 
accuracy can be achieved), the quality of the receiver chip, atmospheric conditions, and sun 
activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).

approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Bluetooth scanning stations were installed and were used to identify visitors crossing the 
gateway through the discovery of their mobile phones. Since the vast majority of mobile 
phones provide Bluetooth functionality this is generally an effective way to automate the 
process of visitor tracking. In fact, visitors can be traced across locations because Bluetooth 
scanning captures the unique identifier associated with the specific mobile phone carried by 
a particular individual. In this way it becomes possible to follow visitors when entering and 
exiting specific halls within the museum throughout their visit, information that can be 
employed to reconstruct the complete pathway they followed across the site. An alternative 
approach to the system adopted at the Louvre would be to use this technology to identify 
visitor proximity to specific landmark locations, for example specific exhibits, which have 
been instrumented with a scanning station. However, this is a less reliable technique in 
practice due to large timing variations in the device discovery process.

The Louvre study used a relatively low number of scanning locations but despite this 
limitation the advantages of this approach against manual data collection are still clear: it is 
possible to track considerably higher number of visitors thus offsetting the coarse-grain 
track reconstruction and produce interesting findings relating to visitor flow. The published 
paper on this study (Yoshimura et al 2012) offers few details of its findings from an audience 
research perspective primarily reporting on the practicalities of recording and the methods 
used to ensure accurate data capture. This approach is found to be both practical and 
relatively inexpensive and permits studies of longer duration for example by operating the 
scanning equipment continuously throughout the year. This would provide unique insights 
into the temporal dynamics of visiting over an extended period of time and would not have 
been realistic without the use of technology.

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively

this: when outdoors, visitors carrying a smartphone can be located using GPS to within a few 
meters of their actual position. When indoors, wireless networking infrastructure can be 
used to achieve the same goal also using the visitors’ mobile phone but at coarser accuracy. 
Location and time are the attributes of a visit that can be most easily recorded but are by no

Museums Association in the UK, approximately half of the population in the USA and

experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the 
methodological, ethical and practical challenges emerging from the use of these 
technologies in the field as well as the limits of their application. Throughout, we are 
mindful that technology is only the enabler and that in many cases such tools would be one 
of several alternatives available to researchers who must make choices guided by 
appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.  
 
technical factors such as visibility of satellites (the more satellites are visible the higher 

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and

accuracy can be achieved), the quality of the receiver chip, atmospheric conditions, and sun 
activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).  
 
of the study and what their participation in it would involve. Forty-six families were 
approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main 
entrance. Participating families were asked to complete a PMM that was used to gather 
data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.

                                        May 2014 

Having completed the pre-visit PMM, families were then provided with a 

 
 
smartphone that was used to record their location for the full duration of their visit, which 
could last up to approximately five hours. Due to the fact that at the time smartphones 
were not as common as today, we opted to provide the same model device to all families so 
that the recorded location data would be of comparable quality. Specifically, we used the 
Openmoko Neo smartphone as our logging device integrating a precise Assisted-GPS unit 
with EGNOS functionality that achieves best accuracy in this locality. Tracking software was 
already installed and operational and the device was placed in a soft pouch that could be 
safely attached to a belt or placed inside a pocket or handbag. Visitor location was logged 
every second by a GPS unit integrated in the smartphone in order to have as detailed a 
record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

London Zoo study. The track has been superimposed the open source Open Street Maps system.

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time. 
 

 

 

 
Figure 2: Dwell time and related descriptive statistics associated with a user-defined region 
corresponding to the café area at the London Zoo. The statistics have been automatically calculated 
and displayed by the Audience Focus Analytics system. 
 
An alternative way to visually represent space occupancy is through the heatmap (cf. Figure 
3), a technique that superimposes colour intensities on locations to represent the relative 
length of visitor dwell times at those locations. Heatmaps are a common technique in Big 
Data analytics due to their effectiveness to visually communicate the relative frequency by 
which specific places are used and can help to quickly identify places of intense interest for 
visitors such as “hot” exhibits and how individuals group around them. For example, a quick 
visual inspection of Figure 3 reveals the main areas where the particular family spent most

of their time. This technique has also been used to analyses visitor traces at the site of the 
Minoan palace and city of Zakros, Crete, Greece (Chrysanthi  2012).

3. Coarse-grain Tracking Indoors 
GPS is an ideal solution for tracking and timing in many outdoors situations but building 
structures and the presence of large reflective surfaces in relatively close proximity to the 
receiver adversely affect the satellite signal. As a result, GPS measurements become 
unreliable in interior spaces and in most cases completely unusable so that alternatives 
must be considered. The implication is that it becomes necessary to deploy purpose-specific 
infrastructure usually at significant cost including installation, calibration and general 
maintenance and operation. Cost is directly related to the desired precision and accuracy, 
the exact exhibition characteristics and layout, and the types and sizes of the exhibits 
present. For a medium-sized museum expenditure would typically range from a few 
thousands to several hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
 
Tate Modern in the UK has used indoors location-sensing technology since the early 
2000s primarily as a means to adapt content presented by its multimedia guide and related 
mobile apps (Wilson 2004). The system employs the gallery’s wi-fi network and has been 
quite successful with visitors through applications such as the Magic Tate Ball, a location-
based game that promotes the exploration of the gallery’s collections. However, the 
technology has severe limitations in that it can only provide room-level accuracy. For this 
reason it has only been employed in rudimentary ways for audience research primarily to 
collect app usage and popularity data.  
 
the Louvre in Paris, France during 2011 (Yoshimura et al 2012). In this case Bluetooth, a 
Personal Area Networking technology, was employed to digitally mark a small number of 
prominent locations in the museum typically gateways between halls. At these locations 

An interesting study using similar indoors coarse-grain technology was carried out at 

 

Page 276

                                        May 2014 

 
Bluetooth scanning stations were installed and were used to identify visitors crossing the 
gateway through the discovery of their mobile phones. Since the vast majority of mobile 
phones provide Bluetooth functionality this is generally an effective way to automate the 
process of visitor tracking. In fact, visitors can be traced across locations because Bluetooth 
scanning captures the unique identifier associated with the specific mobile phone carried by 
a particular individual. In this way it becomes possible to follow visitors when entering and 
exiting specific halls within the museum throughout their visit, information that can be 
employed to reconstruct the complete pathway they followed across the site. An alternative 
approach to the system adopted at the Louvre would be to use this technology to identify 
visitor proximity to specific landmark locations, for example specific exhibits, which have 
been instrumented with a scanning station. However, this is a less reliable technique in 
practice due to large timing variations in the device discovery process.

open source Depthmap software (UCL Space Group 2010). 
 
The Louvre study used a relatively low number of scanning locations but despite this 
limitation the advantages of this approach against manual data collection are still clear: it is 
possible to track considerably higher number of visitors thus offsetting the coarse-grain 
track reconstruction and produce interesting findings relating to visitor flow. The published 
paper on this study (Yoshimura et al 2012) offers few details of its findings from an audience 
research perspective primarily reporting on the practicalities of recording and the methods 
used to ensure accurate data capture. This approach is found to be both practical and 
relatively inexpensive and permits studies of longer duration for example by operating the 
scanning equipment continuously throughout the year. This would provide unique insights 
into the temporal dynamics of visiting over an extended period of time and would not have 
been realistic without the use of technology.

To show how such coarse-grain data can be used effectively to inform analyses of 

 
 
visitor flow, in Figure 4 we show the results of a feasibility study we conducted using similar 
Bluetooth technology in 2006 at the British Museum in London, UK. Figure 4 displays flow 
maps constructed using gateway counts and provides a visual representation of visitor flow 
through the site for example quickly identifying congested areas. This visualisation has been 
generated automatically from tracking data using the Depthmap software (Hillier and 
Tzortzi, 2006; UCL Space Group 2010), which can also produce animated sequences showing 
changes for instance in hourly patterns.  
Before concluding this section on coarse grain location sensing, we note that there 
 
are two very low-cost technologies in current use that could be used for the same purpose 
namely Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and QR bar codes. In both of these cases 
however, it is necessary that the visitors take action in order for their location to be 
recorded: In the case of RFID they have to bring their mobile phone to close proximity to the 
RFID tag marking the specific location of interest and in the case of QR they need to scan the 
bar code with the phone camera. Despite these rather severe limitations RFID has been 
used successfully to track visitor behaviour in a pioneering project at the Exploratorium (Hsi 
and Fait, 2005). QR codes have become very common in recent years and although their 
primary purpose is to provide smartphones with links to supplemental online information 
relating to exhibits, they can also be used to trace visitors (as long as they scan them) 
through an exhibition using standard web tracking software.

4. Fine-grain Tracking Indoors 
The state-of-the-art in mobile location sensing is Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology, which 
can provide location estimates with accuracy of a few centimetres as well as detect visitor 
orientation. Unfortunately, as with many new technologies, the cost of deployment is 
currently very high and requires the installation of mini-satellites covering the monitored 
space. Although in the vast majority of cases this technology would be prohibitively high for

Abstract: 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. In this paper, we highlight the costs and benefits of 
the application of these technologies to audience research through specific case studies set 
within varied museum environments. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 
experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and

Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research1 methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. Indeed, the daily routine of most contemporary 
researchers would involve the use of databases and spreadsheets to manage and tabulate

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively 
recent additions to this set of tools and have further extended our ability to reach actual 
and potential audiences and improve the accuracy and detail of record keeping. Today, a 
new generation of mobile technology is rapidly becoming affordable and offers the 
opportunity to further develop the technology toolkit of audience research. Its core 
ingredients are the capability to automatically capture location and other sensor2 input from 
commodity consumer devices carried by visitors and use this information to conduct 
analyses through a new generation of machine learning and visualization techniques.

record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time.

corresponding to the café area at the London Zoo. The statistics have been automatically calculated 
and displayed by the Audience Focus Analytics system. 
 
An alternative way to visually represent space occupancy is through the heatmap (cf. Figure 
3), a technique that superimposes colour intensities on locations to represent the relative 
length of visitor dwell times at those locations. Heatmaps are a common technique in Big 
Data analytics due to their effectiveness to visually communicate the relative frequency by 
which specific places are used and can help to quickly identify places of intense interest for 
visitors such as “hot” exhibits and how individuals group around them. For example, a quick 
visual inspection of Figure 3 reveals the main areas where the particular family spent most

of their time. This technique has also been used to analyses visitor traces at the site of the 
Minoan palace and city of Zakros, Crete, Greece (Chrysanthi  2012).

3. Coarse-grain Tracking Indoors 
GPS is an ideal solution for tracking and timing in many outdoors situations but building 
structures and the presence of large reflective surfaces in relatively close proximity to the 
receiver adversely affect the satellite signal. As a result, GPS measurements become 
unreliable in interior spaces and in most cases completely unusable so that alternatives 
must be considered. The implication is that it becomes necessary to deploy purpose-specific 
infrastructure usually at significant cost including installation, calibration and general 
maintenance and operation. Cost is directly related to the desired precision and accuracy, 
the exact exhibition characteristics and layout, and the types and sizes of the exhibits 
present. For a medium-sized museum expenditure would typically range from a few 
thousands to several hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
 
Tate Modern in the UK has used indoors location-sensing technology since the early 
2000s primarily as a means to adapt content presented by its multimedia guide and related 
mobile apps (Wilson 2004). The system employs the gallery’s wi-fi network and has been 
quite successful with visitors through applications such as the Magic Tate Ball, a location-
based game that promotes the exploration of the gallery’s collections. However, the 
technology has severe limitations in that it can only provide room-level accuracy. For this 
reason it has only been employed in rudimentary ways for audience research primarily to 
collect app usage and popularity data.  
 
the Louvre in Paris, France during 2011 (Yoshimura et al 2012). In this case Bluetooth, a 
Personal Area Networking technology, was employed to digitally mark a small number of 
prominent locations in the museum typically gateways between halls. At these locations 

An interesting study using similar indoors coarse-grain technology was carried out at

                                        May 2014 

 
Bluetooth scanning stations were installed and were used to identify visitors crossing the 
gateway through the discovery of their mobile phones. Since the vast majority of mobile 
phones provide Bluetooth functionality this is generally an effective way to automate the 
process of visitor tracking. In fact, visitors can be traced across locations because Bluetooth 
scanning captures the unique identifier associated with the specific mobile phone carried by 
a particular individual. In this way it becomes possible to follow visitors when entering and 
exiting specific halls within the museum throughout their visit, information that can be 
employed to reconstruct the complete pathway they followed across the site. An alternative 
approach to the system adopted at the Louvre would be to use this technology to identify 
visitor proximity to specific landmark locations, for example specific exhibits, which have 
been instrumented with a scanning station. However, this is a less reliable technique in 
practice due to large timing variations in the device discovery process.

open source Depthmap software (UCL Space Group 2010). 
 
The Louvre study used a relatively low number of scanning locations but despite this 
limitation the advantages of this approach against manual data collection are still clear: it is 
possible to track considerably higher number of visitors thus offsetting the coarse-grain 
track reconstruction and produce interesting findings relating to visitor flow. The published 
paper on this study (Yoshimura et al 2012) offers few details of its findings from an audience 
research perspective primarily reporting on the practicalities of recording and the methods 
used to ensure accurate data capture. This approach is found to be both practical and 
relatively inexpensive and permits studies of longer duration for example by operating the 
scanning equipment continuously throughout the year. This would provide unique insights 
into the temporal dynamics of visiting over an extended period of time and would not have 
been realistic without the use of technology.

To show how such coarse-grain data can be used effectively to inform analyses of 

 
 
visitor flow, in Figure 4 we show the results of a feasibility study we conducted using similar 
Bluetooth technology in 2006 at the British Museum in London, UK. Figure 4 displays flow 
maps constructed using gateway counts and provides a visual representation of visitor flow 
through the site for example quickly identifying congested areas. This visualisation has been 
generated automatically from tracking data using the Depthmap software (Hillier and 
Tzortzi, 2006; UCL Space Group 2010), which can also produce animated sequences showing 
changes for instance in hourly patterns.  
Before concluding this section on coarse grain location sensing, we note that there 
 
are two very low-cost technologies in current use that could be used for the same purpose 
namely Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and QR bar codes. In both of these cases 
however, it is necessary that the visitors take action in order for their location to be 
recorded: In the case of RFID they have to bring their mobile phone to close proximity to the 
RFID tag marking the specific location of interest and in the case of QR they need to scan the 
bar code with the phone camera. Despite these rather severe limitations RFID has been 
used successfully to track visitor behaviour in a pioneering project at the Exploratorium (Hsi 
and Fait, 2005). QR codes have become very common in recent years and although their 
primary purpose is to provide smartphones with links to supplemental online information 
relating to exhibits, they can also be used to trace visitors (as long as they scan them) 
through an exhibition using standard web tracking software.

Gallery (courtesy Martin Tröndle). 
 
4. Fine-grain Tracking Indoors 
The state-of-the-art in mobile location sensing is Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology, which 
can provide location estimates with accuracy of a few centimetres as well as detect visitor 
orientation. Unfortunately, as with many new technologies, the cost of deployment is 
currently very high and requires the installation of mini-satellites covering the monitored 
space. Although in the vast majority of cases this technology would be prohibitively high for

                                        May 2014 

In any case, use of UWB location-sensing technology produced highly accurate tracks 

 
most museums, it was actually used for a study conducted in 2009 at the Art Museum of St. 
Gallen, Switzerland.  This work was made possible by a research grant and participation by a 
leading manufacturer of such systems, and was available as a temporary installation rather 
than a permanent feature of the gallery.  
 
of visitors while also correctly identifying orientation within the galleries. Figure 5 shows 
several of the tracks recorded in a particular gallery, which reveal a uniquely detailed 
tracking and timing data set exceeding the capabilities of any alternative indoor or outdoor 
system (Tröndle et al 2013). The data and additional bio-sensed attributes (cf. Section 4 
below) have been successfully used to quantify the level of engagement with works of art 
and explore its relationship to social interaction during the visit. Although clearly this 
technology is still generally not yet affordable for museums, in the long term the availability 
of data at very high accuracy and detail opens up distinct opportunities for example, in 
tracking visitors interactions at the individual artefact level. The National Maritime Museum 
in Greenwich, UK is one of the sites conducting such experiments with a permanent 
installation of UWB in a single of its recently redeveloped galleries. 
 
5. Other Sensing Modalities 
To be sure, location sensing is the most readily available mobile sensing technology and 
suitable for extensive use in audience research, but several other sensing modalities 
currently at different stages of maturity, offer interesting opportunities. Firstly, 
smartphones typically carry a dozen or so sensors5 that can be used to capture a variety of 
personal and environmental information: high quality three- and six-dimensional 
accelerometers have been used to infer user activities for example distinguishing between 
periods of standing, sitting and walking in which case the speed and gait can be estimated. 
Microphones are of course ubiquitous in all phones and have been used to capture 
fragments of visitor speech which when processed by suitable algorithms can infer the 
emotional state of the speakers and their levels of stress. These techniques are rapidly 
reaching maturity and will soon become adequately dependable in audience research. 
In our London Zoo study, we employed proximity sensors to measure spatial density, 
 
which can be used to provide a good estimate of crowding levels. In other projects we have 
experimented with a variety of environmental and biological sensors such as those 
measuring air quality and pollution, noise, ambient radiation, temperature, humidity, heart 
rate and skin conductance, all of which are widely available at very low price. An interesting 
use of bio-sensing was employed in the St. Gallen study discussed above, where skin sensors 
were used to measure skin conductance which is widely believed to indicate the emotional 
state of the carrier. More recently, mobile electroencephalographs have become affordable 
as they have been commoditised as game controllers, and can be easily used to measure 
cognitive activity and responses to particular experiences. This trend is accelerating and it is 
reasonable to expect mobile sensing devices to become commonplace in the short term, 
although this is not to say that their use does not pose a challenge for audience research.

Abstract: 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. In this paper, we highlight the costs and benefits of 
the application of these technologies to audience research through specific case studies set 
within varied museum environments. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 
experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. This paper also discusses the methodological, ethical and 
practical challenges emerging from the use of these technologies in the field as well as the 
limits of their application.

1. Introduction 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research1 methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. Indeed, the daily routine of most contemporary 
researchers would involve the use of databases and spreadsheets to manage and tabulate

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively 
recent additions to this set of tools and have further extended our ability to reach actual 
and potential audiences and improve the accuracy and detail of record keeping. Today, a 
new generation of mobile technology is rapidly becoming affordable and offers the 
opportunity to further develop the technology toolkit of audience research. Its core 
ingredients are the capability to automatically capture location and other sensor2 input from 
commodity consumer devices carried by visitors and use this information to conduct 
analyses through a new generation of machine learning and visualization techniques.  
 
the visitor at specific time intervals. In this way, it becomes possible to track visitors as they 
move through an exhibition or site without the active involvement of a researcher. There is 
however great variation in the capabilities of different technology alternatives to achieve 
this: when outdoors, visitors carrying a smartphone can be located using GPS to within a few 
meters of their actual position. When indoors, wireless networking infrastructure can be 
used to achieve the same goal also using the visitors’ mobile phone but at coarser accuracy. 
Location and time are the attributes of a visit that can be most easily recorded but are by no 
means the only: mobile sensing technology can also be used to infer the activities that the 
visitors are involved in, the ambience of their immediate surroundings, and in some cases 
their emotional and cognitive responses to their museum experience.  
Moreover, a current trend in information technology is towards consumerization in 
 
what is becoming known as the BYOD (Bring your Own Device) approach. BYOD advocates 
that IT in general and mobile sensing technology specifically is increasingly incorporated in 
consumer devices such as the mobile phones carried by visitors, and that such devices can 
be employed for the delivery of systems and applications offered by museums. For example, 
it is no longer necessary to provide a hardware-based audio or electronic guide to visitors 
but a museum can instead employ an app on the visitor’s own smartphone offering the 
same functionality thus significantly extending the availability of such applications. Indeed, 
according to a recent study by the Survey of American Alliance of Museums and the 
Museums Association in the UK, approximately half of the population in the USA and 
Western Europe are already users of smartphones (Fusion Research + Analytics 2012). These 
smartphones can also be employed to conduct audience research capturing rich data sets 
that are amenable to a new generation of analysis techniques, commonly referred to as Big 
Data analytics (Barton and Court 2012), which can provide new insights on the underlying 
patterns of behaviour. 
 
technologies to audience research through specific case studies set within varied museum 
environments, each employing technology that matches their particular requirements and 
characteristics. In each case, we also show examples of how the data has been analysed 
using modern Big Data techniques. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 

In this paper, we highlight the advantages and limitations of the application of these

experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the 
methodological, ethical and practical challenges emerging from the use of these 
technologies in the field as well as the limits of their application. Throughout, we are 
mindful that technology is only the enabler and that in many cases such tools would be one 
of several alternatives available to researchers who must make choices guided by 
appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.  
 
technical factors such as visibility of satellites (the more satellites are visible the higher 

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and 

 

Page 272 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
accuracy can be achieved), the quality of the receiver chip, atmospheric conditions, and sun 
activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).  
 
of the study and what their participation in it would involve. Forty-six families were 
approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main 
entrance. Participating families were asked to complete a PMM that was used to gather 
data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.

                                        May 2014 

Having completed the pre-visit PMM, families were then provided with a 

 
 
smartphone that was used to record their location for the full duration of their visit, which 
could last up to approximately five hours. Due to the fact that at the time smartphones 
were not as common as today, we opted to provide the same model device to all families so 
that the recorded location data would be of comparable quality. Specifically, we used the 
Openmoko Neo smartphone as our logging device integrating a precise Assisted-GPS unit 
with EGNOS functionality that achieves best accuracy in this locality. Tracking software was 
already installed and operational and the device was placed in a soft pouch that could be 
safely attached to a belt or placed inside a pocket or handbag. Visitor location was logged 
every second by a GPS unit integrated in the smartphone in order to have as detailed a 
record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time.

Bluetooth scanning stations were installed and were used to identify visitors crossing the 
gateway through the discovery of their mobile phones. Since the vast majority of mobile 
phones provide Bluetooth functionality this is generally an effective way to automate the 
process of visitor tracking. In fact, visitors can be traced across locations because Bluetooth 
scanning captures the unique identifier associated with the specific mobile phone carried by 
a particular individual. In this way it becomes possible to follow visitors when entering and 
exiting specific halls within the museum throughout their visit, information that can be 
employed to reconstruct the complete pathway they followed across the site. An alternative 
approach to the system adopted at the Louvre would be to use this technology to identify 
visitor proximity to specific landmark locations, for example specific exhibits, which have 
been instrumented with a scanning station. However, this is a less reliable technique in 
practice due to large timing variations in the device discovery process.

open source Depthmap software (UCL Space Group 2010). 
 
The Louvre study used a relatively low number of scanning locations but despite this 
limitation the advantages of this approach against manual data collection are still clear: it is 
possible to track considerably higher number of visitors thus offsetting the coarse-grain 
track reconstruction and produce interesting findings relating to visitor flow. The published 
paper on this study (Yoshimura et al 2012) offers few details of its findings from an audience 
research perspective primarily reporting on the practicalities of recording and the methods 
used to ensure accurate data capture. This approach is found to be both practical and 
relatively inexpensive and permits studies of longer duration for example by operating the 
scanning equipment continuously throughout the year. This would provide unique insights 
into the temporal dynamics of visiting over an extended period of time and would not have 
been realistic without the use of technology.

To show how such coarse-grain data can be used effectively to inform analyses of 

 
 
visitor flow, in Figure 4 we show the results of a feasibility study we conducted using similar 
Bluetooth technology in 2006 at the British Museum in London, UK. Figure 4 displays flow 
maps constructed using gateway counts and provides a visual representation of visitor flow 
through the site for example quickly identifying congested areas. This visualisation has been 
generated automatically from tracking data using the Depthmap software (Hillier and 
Tzortzi, 2006; UCL Space Group 2010), which can also produce animated sequences showing 
changes for instance in hourly patterns.  
Before concluding this section on coarse grain location sensing, we note that there 
 
are two very low-cost technologies in current use that could be used for the same purpose 
namely Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and QR bar codes. In both of these cases 
however, it is necessary that the visitors take action in order for their location to be 
recorded: In the case of RFID they have to bring their mobile phone to close proximity to the 
RFID tag marking the specific location of interest and in the case of QR they need to scan the 
bar code with the phone camera. Despite these rather severe limitations RFID has been 
used successfully to track visitor behaviour in a pioneering project at the Exploratorium (Hsi 
and Fait, 2005). QR codes have become very common in recent years and although their 
primary purpose is to provide smartphones with links to supplemental online information 
relating to exhibits, they can also be used to trace visitors (as long as they scan them) 
through an exhibition using standard web tracking software.

4. Fine-grain Tracking Indoors 
The state-of-the-art in mobile location sensing is Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology, which 
can provide location estimates with accuracy of a few centimetres as well as detect visitor 
orientation. Unfortunately, as with many new technologies, the cost of deployment is 
currently very high and requires the installation of mini-satellites covering the monitored 
space. Although in the vast majority of cases this technology would be prohibitively high for

                                        May 2014 

In any case, use of UWB location-sensing technology produced highly accurate tracks 

 
most museums, it was actually used for a study conducted in 2009 at the Art Museum of St. 
Gallen, Switzerland.  This work was made possible by a research grant and participation by a 
leading manufacturer of such systems, and was available as a temporary installation rather 
than a permanent feature of the gallery.  
 
of visitors while also correctly identifying orientation within the galleries. Figure 5 shows 
several of the tracks recorded in a particular gallery, which reveal a uniquely detailed 
tracking and timing data set exceeding the capabilities of any alternative indoor or outdoor 
system (Tröndle et al 2013). The data and additional bio-sensed attributes (cf. Section 4 
below) have been successfully used to quantify the level of engagement with works of art 
and explore its relationship to social interaction during the visit. Although clearly this 
technology is still generally not yet affordable for museums, in the long term the availability 
of data at very high accuracy and detail opens up distinct opportunities for example, in 
tracking visitors interactions at the individual artefact level. The National Maritime Museum 
in Greenwich, UK is one of the sites conducting such experiments with a permanent 
installation of UWB in a single of its recently redeveloped galleries. 
 
5. Other Sensing Modalities 
To be sure, location sensing is the most readily available mobile sensing technology and 
suitable for extensive use in audience research, but several other sensing modalities 
currently at different stages of maturity, offer interesting opportunities. Firstly, 
smartphones typically carry a dozen or so sensors5 that can be used to capture a variety of 
personal and environmental information: high quality three- and six-dimensional 
accelerometers have been used to infer user activities for example distinguishing between 
periods of standing, sitting and walking in which case the speed and gait can be estimated. 
Microphones are of course ubiquitous in all phones and have been used to capture 
fragments of visitor speech which when processed by suitable algorithms can infer the 
emotional state of the speakers and their levels of stress. These techniques are rapidly 
reaching maturity and will soon become adequately dependable in audience research. 
In our London Zoo study, we employed proximity sensors to measure spatial density, 
 
which can be used to provide a good estimate of crowding levels. In other projects we have 
experimented with a variety of environmental and biological sensors such as those 
measuring air quality and pollution, noise, ambient radiation, temperature, humidity, heart 
rate and skin conductance, all of which are widely available at very low price. An interesting 
use of bio-sensing was employed in the St. Gallen study discussed above, where skin sensors 
were used to measure skin conductance which is widely believed to indicate the emotional 
state of the carrier. More recently, mobile electroencephalographs have become affordable 
as they have been commoditised as game controllers, and can be easily used to measure 
cognitive activity and responses to particular experiences. This trend is accelerating and it is 
reasonable to expect mobile sensing devices to become commonplace in the short term, 
although this is not to say that their use does not pose a challenge for audience research.  

 

Page 279 

A final point in the current discussion relates to the inference of social interactions in 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
 
general and through the use of location or proximity data in particular. For example, when 
two or more visitors are tracked it is possible to deduce that they belong to the same group 
or that they are interacting at a particular time by observing the duration of their 
collocation. This heuristic has been successfully used in the study of social networks in a 
physical setting (Kostakos et al 2011) and is directly applicable for audience research. 
Typically, this requires the specification of a threshold on spatio-temporal co-presence that 
indicates that contact has occurred. There is further evidence to support this assumption 
and several related studies report success with this technique (Vu et al 2011).  
 
6. Methodological Considerations 
The design of any type of audience study is a balancing act whereby alternative 
methodologies must be weighed against the aims and research questions of the study as 
well as the time and resources available to complete it. While further practical experience 
with these technologies is crucial, we anticipate that the ability of mobile sensing 
technologies to collect Big Data sets from visitors at significantly reduced cost and effort 
makes large-scale and longitudinal studies decidedly easier to conduct. Technology may 
finally help overcome the financial barriers in conducting such studies, a long-standing but 
so far unattainable ambition of the field. The cost advantage of automating data collection 
and the BYOD approach in particular provide critical support for a shift away from project-
based studies as the main research approach, which is limited in that it only captures 
snapshots of short-term learning benefits while making cross-institution comparisons very 
difficult. Furthermore, these technologies can accelerate the data collection and analysis 
cycle thus facilitating evaluation studies where findings be fed back to the project team at 
very short time frames thus increasing the potential impact of formative evaluation studies 
especially in cases were rapid prototyping of sections or complete exhibitions is required.  
 
quality of data collected by a person and data collected automatically through technology. 
An attempt to explore this question specifically has been the work of Baldwin and Kuriakose 
(2009) that provides encouraging preliminary evidence in favour of the technology. 
Nevertheless, further studies are required to consider the details especially in fully 
developed settings that fully account for the realities of museum fieldwork.  
 
design of a successful study especially considering the implications of BYOD. First, it is 
necessary to install recoding software on the visitor’s mobile device. This is greatly 
facilitated by the widespread availability of software distributions mechanisms such as 
Google Play and the App Store, which allow the seamless and familiar methods for the 
installation of the required software. However, this process also involves the provision of a 
privacy and security policy by the research team, which should be in line with guidelines for 
ethical research, and in any case adds an extra layer of complexity to the project as research 
need to ensure that it is both sufficient and comprehensive. In particular, the research team 

From a practical perspective, there are several decisions that must be made for the 

One question that merits further consideration at this stage is the comparative

Abstract: 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. In this paper, we highlight the costs and benefits of 
the application of these technologies to audience research through specific case studies set 
within varied museum environments. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 
experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. This paper also discusses the methodological, ethical and 
practical challenges emerging from the use of these technologies in the field as well as the 
limits of their application.

1. Introduction 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research1 methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. Indeed, the daily routine of most contemporary 
researchers would involve the use of databases and spreadsheets to manage and tabulate

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively 
recent additions to this set of tools and have further extended our ability to reach actual 
and potential audiences and improve the accuracy and detail of record keeping. Today, a 
new generation of mobile technology is rapidly becoming affordable and offers the 
opportunity to further develop the technology toolkit of audience research. Its core 
ingredients are the capability to automatically capture location and other sensor2 input from 
commodity consumer devices carried by visitors and use this information to conduct 
analyses through a new generation of machine learning and visualization techniques.  
 
the visitor at specific time intervals. In this way, it becomes possible to track visitors as they 
move through an exhibition or site without the active involvement of a researcher. There is 
however great variation in the capabilities of different technology alternatives to achieve 
this: when outdoors, visitors carrying a smartphone can be located using GPS to within a few 
meters of their actual position. When indoors, wireless networking infrastructure can be 
used to achieve the same goal also using the visitors’ mobile phone but at coarser accuracy. 
Location and time are the attributes of a visit that can be most easily recorded but are by no 
means the only: mobile sensing technology can also be used to infer the activities that the 
visitors are involved in, the ambience of their immediate surroundings, and in some cases 
their emotional and cognitive responses to their museum experience.  
Moreover, a current trend in information technology is towards consumerization in 
 
what is becoming known as the BYOD (Bring your Own Device) approach. BYOD advocates 
that IT in general and mobile sensing technology specifically is increasingly incorporated in 
consumer devices such as the mobile phones carried by visitors, and that such devices can 
be employed for the delivery of systems and applications offered by museums. For example, 
it is no longer necessary to provide a hardware-based audio or electronic guide to visitors 
but a museum can instead employ an app on the visitor’s own smartphone offering the 
same functionality thus significantly extending the availability of such applications. Indeed, 
according to a recent study by the Survey of American Alliance of Museums and the 
Museums Association in the UK, approximately half of the population in the USA and 
Western Europe are already users of smartphones (Fusion Research + Analytics 2012). These 
smartphones can also be employed to conduct audience research capturing rich data sets 
that are amenable to a new generation of analysis techniques, commonly referred to as Big 
Data analytics (Barton and Court 2012), which can provide new insights on the underlying 
patterns of behaviour. 
 
technologies to audience research through specific case studies set within varied museum 
environments, each employing technology that matches their particular requirements and 
characteristics. In each case, we also show examples of how the data has been analysed 
using modern Big Data techniques. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 

In this paper, we highlight the advantages and limitations of the application of these

experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the 
methodological, ethical and practical challenges emerging from the use of these 
technologies in the field as well as the limits of their application. Throughout, we are 
mindful that technology is only the enabler and that in many cases such tools would be one 
of several alternatives available to researchers who must make choices guided by 
appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.  
 
technical factors such as visibility of satellites (the more satellites are visible the higher 

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and 

 

Page 272 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
accuracy can be achieved), the quality of the receiver chip, atmospheric conditions, and sun 
activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).  
 
of the study and what their participation in it would involve. Forty-six families were 
approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main 
entrance. Participating families were asked to complete a PMM that was used to gather 
data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.

                                        May 2014 

Having completed the pre-visit PMM, families were then provided with a 

 
 
smartphone that was used to record their location for the full duration of their visit, which 
could last up to approximately five hours. Due to the fact that at the time smartphones 
were not as common as today, we opted to provide the same model device to all families so 
that the recorded location data would be of comparable quality. Specifically, we used the 
Openmoko Neo smartphone as our logging device integrating a precise Assisted-GPS unit 
with EGNOS functionality that achieves best accuracy in this locality. Tracking software was 
already installed and operational and the device was placed in a soft pouch that could be 
safely attached to a belt or placed inside a pocket or handbag. Visitor location was logged 
every second by a GPS unit integrated in the smartphone in order to have as detailed a 
record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

London Zoo study. The track has been superimposed the open source Open Street Maps system.

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time.

corresponding to the café area at the London Zoo. The statistics have been automatically calculated 
and displayed by the Audience Focus Analytics system. 
 
An alternative way to visually represent space occupancy is through the heatmap (cf. Figure 
3), a technique that superimposes colour intensities on locations to represent the relative 
length of visitor dwell times at those locations. Heatmaps are a common technique in Big 
Data analytics due to their effectiveness to visually communicate the relative frequency by 
which specific places are used and can help to quickly identify places of intense interest for 
visitors such as “hot” exhibits and how individuals group around them. For example, a quick 
visual inspection of Figure 3 reveals the main areas where the particular family spent most

of their time. This technique has also been used to analyses visitor traces at the site of the 
Minoan palace and city of Zakros, Crete, Greece (Chrysanthi  2012).

3. Coarse-grain Tracking Indoors 
GPS is an ideal solution for tracking and timing in many outdoors situations but building 
structures and the presence of large reflective surfaces in relatively close proximity to the 
receiver adversely affect the satellite signal. As a result, GPS measurements become 
unreliable in interior spaces and in most cases completely unusable so that alternatives 
must be considered. The implication is that it becomes necessary to deploy purpose-specific 
infrastructure usually at significant cost including installation, calibration and general 
maintenance and operation. Cost is directly related to the desired precision and accuracy, 
the exact exhibition characteristics and layout, and the types and sizes of the exhibits 
present. For a medium-sized museum expenditure would typically range from a few 
thousands to several hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
 
Tate Modern in the UK has used indoors location-sensing technology since the early 
2000s primarily as a means to adapt content presented by its multimedia guide and related 
mobile apps (Wilson 2004). The system employs the gallery’s wi-fi network and has been 
quite successful with visitors through applications such as the Magic Tate Ball, a location-
based game that promotes the exploration of the gallery’s collections. However, the 
technology has severe limitations in that it can only provide room-level accuracy. For this 
reason it has only been employed in rudimentary ways for audience research primarily to 
collect app usage and popularity data.  
 
the Louvre in Paris, France during 2011 (Yoshimura et al 2012). In this case Bluetooth, a 
Personal Area Networking technology, was employed to digitally mark a small number of 
prominent locations in the museum typically gateways between halls. At these locations 

An interesting study using similar indoors coarse-grain technology was carried out at 

 

Page 276 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
Bluetooth scanning stations were installed and were used to identify visitors crossing the 
gateway through the discovery of their mobile phones. Since the vast majority of mobile 
phones provide Bluetooth functionality this is generally an effective way to automate the 
process of visitor tracking. In fact, visitors can be traced across locations because Bluetooth 
scanning captures the unique identifier associated with the specific mobile phone carried by 
a particular individual. In this way it becomes possible to follow visitors when entering and 
exiting specific halls within the museum throughout their visit, information that can be 
employed to reconstruct the complete pathway they followed across the site. An alternative 
approach to the system adopted at the Louvre would be to use this technology to identify 
visitor proximity to specific landmark locations, for example specific exhibits, which have 
been instrumented with a scanning station. However, this is a less reliable technique in 
practice due to large timing variations in the device discovery process.

open source Depthmap software (UCL Space Group 2010). 
 
The Louvre study used a relatively low number of scanning locations but despite this 
limitation the advantages of this approach against manual data collection are still clear: it is 
possible to track considerably higher number of visitors thus offsetting the coarse-grain 
track reconstruction and produce interesting findings relating to visitor flow. The published 
paper on this study (Yoshimura et al 2012) offers few details of its findings from an audience 
research perspective primarily reporting on the practicalities of recording and the methods 
used to ensure accurate data capture. This approach is found to be both practical and 
relatively inexpensive and permits studies of longer duration for example by operating the 
scanning equipment continuously throughout the year. This would provide unique insights 
into the temporal dynamics of visiting over an extended period of time and would not have 
been realistic without the use of technology.

To show how such coarse-grain data can be used effectively to inform analyses of 

 
 
visitor flow, in Figure 4 we show the results of a feasibility study we conducted using similar 
Bluetooth technology in 2006 at the British Museum in London, UK. Figure 4 displays flow 
maps constructed using gateway counts and provides a visual representation of visitor flow 
through the site for example quickly identifying congested areas. This visualisation has been 
generated automatically from tracking data using the Depthmap software (Hillier and 
Tzortzi, 2006; UCL Space Group 2010), which can also produce animated sequences showing 
changes for instance in hourly patterns.  
Before concluding this section on coarse grain location sensing, we note that there 
 
are two very low-cost technologies in current use that could be used for the same purpose 
namely Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and QR bar codes. In both of these cases 
however, it is necessary that the visitors take action in order for their location to be 
recorded: In the case of RFID they have to bring their mobile phone to close proximity to the 
RFID tag marking the specific location of interest and in the case of QR they need to scan the 
bar code with the phone camera. Despite these rather severe limitations RFID has been 
used successfully to track visitor behaviour in a pioneering project at the Exploratorium (Hsi 
and Fait, 2005). QR codes have become very common in recent years and although their 
primary purpose is to provide smartphones with links to supplemental online information 
relating to exhibits, they can also be used to trace visitors (as long as they scan them) 
through an exhibition using standard web tracking software.

4. Fine-grain Tracking Indoors 
The state-of-the-art in mobile location sensing is Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology, which 
can provide location estimates with accuracy of a few centimetres as well as detect visitor 
orientation. Unfortunately, as with many new technologies, the cost of deployment is 
currently very high and requires the installation of mini-satellites covering the monitored 
space. Although in the vast majority of cases this technology would be prohibitively high for

In any case, use of UWB location-sensing technology produced highly accurate tracks 

 
most museums, it was actually used for a study conducted in 2009 at the Art Museum of St. 
Gallen, Switzerland.  This work was made possible by a research grant and participation by a 
leading manufacturer of such systems, and was available as a temporary installation rather 
than a permanent feature of the gallery.  
 
of visitors while also correctly identifying orientation within the galleries. Figure 5 shows 
several of the tracks recorded in a particular gallery, which reveal a uniquely detailed 
tracking and timing data set exceeding the capabilities of any alternative indoor or outdoor 
system (Tröndle et al 2013). The data and additional bio-sensed attributes (cf. Section 4 
below) have been successfully used to quantify the level of engagement with works of art 
and explore its relationship to social interaction during the visit. Although clearly this 
technology is still generally not yet affordable for museums, in the long term the availability 
of data at very high accuracy and detail opens up distinct opportunities for example, in 
tracking visitors interactions at the individual artefact level. The National Maritime Museum 
in Greenwich, UK is one of the sites conducting such experiments with a permanent 
installation of UWB in a single of its recently redeveloped galleries. 
 
5. Other Sensing Modalities 
To be sure, location sensing is the most readily available mobile sensing technology and 
suitable for extensive use in audience research, but several other sensing modalities 
currently at different stages of maturity, offer interesting opportunities. Firstly, 
smartphones typically carry a dozen or so sensors5 that can be used to capture a variety of 
personal and environmental information: high quality three- and six-dimensional 
accelerometers have been used to infer user activities for example distinguishing between 
periods of standing, sitting and walking in which case the speed and gait can be estimated. 
Microphones are of course ubiquitous in all phones and have been used to capture 
fragments of visitor speech which when processed by suitable algorithms can infer the 
emotional state of the speakers and their levels of stress. These techniques are rapidly 
reaching maturity and will soon become adequately dependable in audience research. 
In our London Zoo study, we employed proximity sensors to measure spatial density, 
 
which can be used to provide a good estimate of crowding levels. In other projects we have 
experimented with a variety of environmental and biological sensors such as those 
measuring air quality and pollution, noise, ambient radiation, temperature, humidity, heart 
rate and skin conductance, all of which are widely available at very low price. An interesting 
use of bio-sensing was employed in the St. Gallen study discussed above, where skin sensors 
were used to measure skin conductance which is widely believed to indicate the emotional 
state of the carrier. More recently, mobile electroencephalographs have become affordable 
as they have been commoditised as game controllers, and can be easily used to measure 
cognitive activity and responses to particular experiences. This trend is accelerating and it is 
reasonable to expect mobile sensing devices to become commonplace in the short term, 
although this is not to say that their use does not pose a challenge for audience research.  

 

Page 279 

A final point in the current discussion relates to the inference of social interactions in 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
 
general and through the use of location or proximity data in particular. For example, when 
two or more visitors are tracked it is possible to deduce that they belong to the same group 
or that they are interacting at a particular time by observing the duration of their 
collocation. This heuristic has been successfully used in the study of social networks in a 
physical setting (Kostakos et al 2011) and is directly applicable for audience research. 
Typically, this requires the specification of a threshold on spatio-temporal co-presence that 
indicates that contact has occurred. There is further evidence to support this assumption 
and several related studies report success with this technique (Vu et al 2011).  
 
6. Methodological Considerations 
The design of any type of audience study is a balancing act whereby alternative 
methodologies must be weighed against the aims and research questions of the study as 
well as the time and resources available to complete it. While further practical experience 
with these technologies is crucial, we anticipate that the ability of mobile sensing 
technologies to collect Big Data sets from visitors at significantly reduced cost and effort 
makes large-scale and longitudinal studies decidedly easier to conduct. Technology may 
finally help overcome the financial barriers in conducting such studies, a long-standing but 
so far unattainable ambition of the field. The cost advantage of automating data collection 
and the BYOD approach in particular provide critical support for a shift away from project-
based studies as the main research approach, which is limited in that it only captures 
snapshots of short-term learning benefits while making cross-institution comparisons very 
difficult. Furthermore, these technologies can accelerate the data collection and analysis 
cycle thus facilitating evaluation studies where findings be fed back to the project team at 
very short time frames thus increasing the potential impact of formative evaluation studies 
especially in cases were rapid prototyping of sections or complete exhibitions is required.  
 
quality of data collected by a person and data collected automatically through technology. 
An attempt to explore this question specifically has been the work of Baldwin and Kuriakose 
(2009) that provides encouraging preliminary evidence in favour of the technology. 
Nevertheless, further studies are required to consider the details especially in fully 
developed settings that fully account for the realities of museum fieldwork.  
 
design of a successful study especially considering the implications of BYOD. First, it is 
necessary to install recoding software on the visitor’s mobile device. This is greatly 
facilitated by the widespread availability of software distributions mechanisms such as 
Google Play and the App Store, which allow the seamless and familiar methods for the 
installation of the required software. However, this process also involves the provision of a 
privacy and security policy by the research team, which should be in line with guidelines for 
ethical research, and in any case adds an extra layer of complexity to the project as research 
need to ensure that it is both sufficient and comprehensive. In particular, the research team 

From a practical perspective, there are several decisions that must be made for the 

One question that merits further consideration at this stage is the comparative

should be prepared to address visitor concerns about possible intrusions of their privacy 
noting that personal devices typically store highly sensitive information that should not be 
addressed. We discuss this issue further in the following section. 

The choice of the specific mobile location-sensing technology employed depends on 

Similar to other research tools their successful use requires that they serve the 

the particular physical setting for the study, and of course whether tracking will take place 
outdoors or indoors. For example, the physical attributes of the exhibits displayed have 
significant bearing on the required accuracy for successful tracking: where exhibits extend 
over a large area, such as in zoos, lower accuracy systems could work well. Object displays 
with high item density would require high accuracy location sensing to differentiate 
between them and at very high densities would stretch the capabilities of any system for 
questions relating to specific objects rather than the display as a whole. The same factors of 
physical layout also influence the interpretation of the collected observations, for example 
assessing the level of engagement with a display meaningful inferring interaction requires 
proximal presence for a period exceeding a minimum time threshold or confirmation of the 
visitor orientation.  
 
exploration of the questions set out the study. We anticipate that in the medium term while 
the technologies become more usable their most effective use will be in a mixed approach 
where technology-based data collection can be incorporated into a comprehensive 
methodology that derives from specific research questions. 
 
7. Implications for Research Ethics 
Research ethics are central in any study involving human participants, yet the type and 
volume of data that is possible to capture and process using these technologies raises 
distinct issues (see also Raento et al 2009 for an extended discussion of this question 
specifically). Naturally, the first step in ameliorating such concerns is to carefully draft the 
study information sheet so as to clearly explain what data is collected and how, how it will 
be processed and anonymized. In particular, at this stage of their development it is more 
likely that researchers involved in data collection may not be familiar with the full 
implications of the use of this technology and for this reason it is necessary to incorporate 
targeted training in understanding data collection in this manner as well as related methods 
for the effective protection of participant anonymity and dealing with privacy issues.  
 
and other sensitive information and despite security measures already in place it is not 
uncommon that such information can be accessed (maliciously or unintentionally) or that 
visitors perceive a risk in this possibility. Such concerns are not unfounded and are 
reinforced by high-visibility incidents widely reported in the public press. Prevention of such 
incidents requires firstly careful technical development where appropriate and also 
awareness of these risks by the research team so that appropriate action is taken when 
necessary. To this end, all research team members must have access to a set of practical 

Personal mobile devices, a core ingredient of BYOD, invariably contain confidential

Abstract: 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. In this paper, we highlight the costs and benefits of 
the application of these technologies to audience research through specific case studies set 
within varied museum environments. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 
experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. This paper also discusses the methodological, ethical and 
practical challenges emerging from the use of these technologies in the field as well as the 
limits of their application.

1. Introduction 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research1 methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. Indeed, the daily routine of most contemporary 
researchers would involve the use of databases and spreadsheets to manage and tabulate

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively 
recent additions to this set of tools and have further extended our ability to reach actual 
and potential audiences and improve the accuracy and detail of record keeping. Today, a 
new generation of mobile technology is rapidly becoming affordable and offers the 
opportunity to further develop the technology toolkit of audience research. Its core 
ingredients are the capability to automatically capture location and other sensor2 input from 
commodity consumer devices carried by visitors and use this information to conduct 
analyses through a new generation of machine learning and visualization techniques.  
 
the visitor at specific time intervals. In this way, it becomes possible to track visitors as they 
move through an exhibition or site without the active involvement of a researcher. There is 
however great variation in the capabilities of different technology alternatives to achieve 
this: when outdoors, visitors carrying a smartphone can be located using GPS to within a few 
meters of their actual position. When indoors, wireless networking infrastructure can be 
used to achieve the same goal also using the visitors’ mobile phone but at coarser accuracy. 
Location and time are the attributes of a visit that can be most easily recorded but are by no 
means the only: mobile sensing technology can also be used to infer the activities that the 
visitors are involved in, the ambience of their immediate surroundings, and in some cases 
their emotional and cognitive responses to their museum experience.  
Moreover, a current trend in information technology is towards consumerization in 
 
what is becoming known as the BYOD (Bring your Own Device) approach. BYOD advocates 
that IT in general and mobile sensing technology specifically is increasingly incorporated in 
consumer devices such as the mobile phones carried by visitors, and that such devices can 
be employed for the delivery of systems and applications offered by museums. For example, 
it is no longer necessary to provide a hardware-based audio or electronic guide to visitors 
but a museum can instead employ an app on the visitor’s own smartphone offering the 
same functionality thus significantly extending the availability of such applications. Indeed, 
according to a recent study by the Survey of American Alliance of Museums and the 
Museums Association in the UK, approximately half of the population in the USA and 
Western Europe are already users of smartphones (Fusion Research + Analytics 2012). These 
smartphones can also be employed to conduct audience research capturing rich data sets 
that are amenable to a new generation of analysis techniques, commonly referred to as Big 
Data analytics (Barton and Court 2012), which can provide new insights on the underlying 
patterns of behaviour. 
 
technologies to audience research through specific case studies set within varied museum 
environments, each employing technology that matches their particular requirements and 
characteristics. In each case, we also show examples of how the data has been analysed 
using modern Big Data techniques. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 

In this paper, we highlight the advantages and limitations of the application of these

experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the 
methodological, ethical and practical challenges emerging from the use of these 
technologies in the field as well as the limits of their application. Throughout, we are 
mindful that technology is only the enabler and that in many cases such tools would be one 
of several alternatives available to researchers who must make choices guided by 
appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.  
 
technical factors such as visibility of satellites (the more satellites are visible the higher 

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and 

 

Page 272 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
accuracy can be achieved), the quality of the receiver chip, atmospheric conditions, and sun 
activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).  
 
of the study and what their participation in it would involve. Forty-six families were 
approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main 
entrance. Participating families were asked to complete a PMM that was used to gather 
data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.

                                        May 2014 

Having completed the pre-visit PMM, families were then provided with a 

 
 
smartphone that was used to record their location for the full duration of their visit, which 
could last up to approximately five hours. Due to the fact that at the time smartphones 
were not as common as today, we opted to provide the same model device to all families so 
that the recorded location data would be of comparable quality. Specifically, we used the 
Openmoko Neo smartphone as our logging device integrating a precise Assisted-GPS unit 
with EGNOS functionality that achieves best accuracy in this locality. Tracking software was 
already installed and operational and the device was placed in a soft pouch that could be 
safely attached to a belt or placed inside a pocket or handbag. Visitor location was logged 
every second by a GPS unit integrated in the smartphone in order to have as detailed a 
record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time.

corresponding to the café area at the London Zoo. The statistics have been automatically calculated 
and displayed by the Audience Focus Analytics system. 
 
An alternative way to visually represent space occupancy is through the heatmap (cf. Figure 
3), a technique that superimposes colour intensities on locations to represent the relative 
length of visitor dwell times at those locations. Heatmaps are a common technique in Big 
Data analytics due to their effectiveness to visually communicate the relative frequency by 
which specific places are used and can help to quickly identify places of intense interest for 
visitors such as “hot” exhibits and how individuals group around them. For example, a quick 
visual inspection of Figure 3 reveals the main areas where the particular family spent most

of their time. This technique has also been used to analyses visitor traces at the site of the 
Minoan palace and city of Zakros, Crete, Greece (Chrysanthi  2012).

3. Coarse-grain Tracking Indoors 
GPS is an ideal solution for tracking and timing in many outdoors situations but building 
structures and the presence of large reflective surfaces in relatively close proximity to the 
receiver adversely affect the satellite signal. As a result, GPS measurements become 
unreliable in interior spaces and in most cases completely unusable so that alternatives 
must be considered. The implication is that it becomes necessary to deploy purpose-specific 
infrastructure usually at significant cost including installation, calibration and general 
maintenance and operation. Cost is directly related to the desired precision and accuracy, 
the exact exhibition characteristics and layout, and the types and sizes of the exhibits 
present. For a medium-sized museum expenditure would typically range from a few 
thousands to several hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
 
Tate Modern in the UK has used indoors location-sensing technology since the early 
2000s primarily as a means to adapt content presented by its multimedia guide and related 
mobile apps (Wilson 2004). The system employs the gallery’s wi-fi network and has been 
quite successful with visitors through applications such as the Magic Tate Ball, a location-
based game that promotes the exploration of the gallery’s collections. However, the 
technology has severe limitations in that it can only provide room-level accuracy. For this 
reason it has only been employed in rudimentary ways for audience research primarily to 
collect app usage and popularity data.  
 
the Louvre in Paris, France during 2011 (Yoshimura et al 2012). In this case Bluetooth, a 
Personal Area Networking technology, was employed to digitally mark a small number of 
prominent locations in the museum typically gateways between halls. At these locations 

An interesting study using similar indoors coarse-grain technology was carried out at 

 

Page 276 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
Bluetooth scanning stations were installed and were used to identify visitors crossing the 
gateway through the discovery of their mobile phones. Since the vast majority of mobile 
phones provide Bluetooth functionality this is generally an effective way to automate the 
process of visitor tracking. In fact, visitors can be traced across locations because Bluetooth 
scanning captures the unique identifier associated with the specific mobile phone carried by 
a particular individual. In this way it becomes possible to follow visitors when entering and 
exiting specific halls within the museum throughout their visit, information that can be 
employed to reconstruct the complete pathway they followed across the site. An alternative 
approach to the system adopted at the Louvre would be to use this technology to identify 
visitor proximity to specific landmark locations, for example specific exhibits, which have 
been instrumented with a scanning station. However, this is a less reliable technique in 
practice due to large timing variations in the device discovery process.

open source Depthmap software (UCL Space Group 2010). 
 
The Louvre study used a relatively low number of scanning locations but despite this 
limitation the advantages of this approach against manual data collection are still clear: it is 
possible to track considerably higher number of visitors thus offsetting the coarse-grain 
track reconstruction and produce interesting findings relating to visitor flow. The published 
paper on this study (Yoshimura et al 2012) offers few details of its findings from an audience 
research perspective primarily reporting on the practicalities of recording and the methods 
used to ensure accurate data capture. This approach is found to be both practical and 
relatively inexpensive and permits studies of longer duration for example by operating the 
scanning equipment continuously throughout the year. This would provide unique insights 
into the temporal dynamics of visiting over an extended period of time and would not have 
been realistic without the use of technology.

To show how such coarse-grain data can be used effectively to inform analyses of 

 
 
visitor flow, in Figure 4 we show the results of a feasibility study we conducted using similar 
Bluetooth technology in 2006 at the British Museum in London, UK. Figure 4 displays flow 
maps constructed using gateway counts and provides a visual representation of visitor flow 
through the site for example quickly identifying congested areas. This visualisation has been 
generated automatically from tracking data using the Depthmap software (Hillier and 
Tzortzi, 2006; UCL Space Group 2010), which can also produce animated sequences showing 
changes for instance in hourly patterns.  
Before concluding this section on coarse grain location sensing, we note that there 
 
are two very low-cost technologies in current use that could be used for the same purpose 
namely Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and QR bar codes. In both of these cases 
however, it is necessary that the visitors take action in order for their location to be 
recorded: In the case of RFID they have to bring their mobile phone to close proximity to the 
RFID tag marking the specific location of interest and in the case of QR they need to scan the 
bar code with the phone camera. Despite these rather severe limitations RFID has been 
used successfully to track visitor behaviour in a pioneering project at the Exploratorium (Hsi 
and Fait, 2005). QR codes have become very common in recent years and although their 
primary purpose is to provide smartphones with links to supplemental online information 
relating to exhibits, they can also be used to trace visitors (as long as they scan them) 
through an exhibition using standard web tracking software.

4. Fine-grain Tracking Indoors 
The state-of-the-art in mobile location sensing is Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology, which 
can provide location estimates with accuracy of a few centimetres as well as detect visitor 
orientation. Unfortunately, as with many new technologies, the cost of deployment is 
currently very high and requires the installation of mini-satellites covering the monitored 
space. Although in the vast majority of cases this technology would be prohibitively high for

In any case, use of UWB location-sensing technology produced highly accurate tracks 

 
most museums, it was actually used for a study conducted in 2009 at the Art Museum of St. 
Gallen, Switzerland.  This work was made possible by a research grant and participation by a 
leading manufacturer of such systems, and was available as a temporary installation rather 
than a permanent feature of the gallery.  
 
of visitors while also correctly identifying orientation within the galleries. Figure 5 shows 
several of the tracks recorded in a particular gallery, which reveal a uniquely detailed 
tracking and timing data set exceeding the capabilities of any alternative indoor or outdoor 
system (Tröndle et al 2013). The data and additional bio-sensed attributes (cf. Section 4 
below) have been successfully used to quantify the level of engagement with works of art 
and explore its relationship to social interaction during the visit. Although clearly this 
technology is still generally not yet affordable for museums, in the long term the availability 
of data at very high accuracy and detail opens up distinct opportunities for example, in 
tracking visitors interactions at the individual artefact level. The National Maritime Museum 
in Greenwich, UK is one of the sites conducting such experiments with a permanent 
installation of UWB in a single of its recently redeveloped galleries. 
 
5. Other Sensing Modalities 
To be sure, location sensing is the most readily available mobile sensing technology and 
suitable for extensive use in audience research, but several other sensing modalities 
currently at different stages of maturity, offer interesting opportunities. Firstly, 
smartphones typically carry a dozen or so sensors5 that can be used to capture a variety of 
personal and environmental information: high quality three- and six-dimensional 
accelerometers have been used to infer user activities for example distinguishing between 
periods of standing, sitting and walking in which case the speed and gait can be estimated. 
Microphones are of course ubiquitous in all phones and have been used to capture 
fragments of visitor speech which when processed by suitable algorithms can infer the 
emotional state of the speakers and their levels of stress. These techniques are rapidly 
reaching maturity and will soon become adequately dependable in audience research. 
In our London Zoo study, we employed proximity sensors to measure spatial density, 
 
which can be used to provide a good estimate of crowding levels. In other projects we have 
experimented with a variety of environmental and biological sensors such as those 
measuring air quality and pollution, noise, ambient radiation, temperature, humidity, heart 
rate and skin conductance, all of which are widely available at very low price. An interesting 
use of bio-sensing was employed in the St. Gallen study discussed above, where skin sensors 
were used to measure skin conductance which is widely believed to indicate the emotional 
state of the carrier. More recently, mobile electroencephalographs have become affordable 
as they have been commoditised as game controllers, and can be easily used to measure 
cognitive activity and responses to particular experiences. This trend is accelerating and it is 
reasonable to expect mobile sensing devices to become commonplace in the short term, 
although this is not to say that their use does not pose a challenge for audience research.  

 

Page 279 

A final point in the current discussion relates to the inference of social interactions in 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
 
general and through the use of location or proximity data in particular. For example, when 
two or more visitors are tracked it is possible to deduce that they belong to the same group 
or that they are interacting at a particular time by observing the duration of their 
collocation. This heuristic has been successfully used in the study of social networks in a 
physical setting (Kostakos et al 2011) and is directly applicable for audience research. 
Typically, this requires the specification of a threshold on spatio-temporal co-presence that 
indicates that contact has occurred. There is further evidence to support this assumption 
and several related studies report success with this technique (Vu et al 2011).  
 
6. Methodological Considerations 
The design of any type of audience study is a balancing act whereby alternative 
methodologies must be weighed against the aims and research questions of the study as 
well as the time and resources available to complete it. While further practical experience 
with these technologies is crucial, we anticipate that the ability of mobile sensing 
technologies to collect Big Data sets from visitors at significantly reduced cost and effort 
makes large-scale and longitudinal studies decidedly easier to conduct. Technology may 
finally help overcome the financial barriers in conducting such studies, a long-standing but 
so far unattainable ambition of the field. The cost advantage of automating data collection 
and the BYOD approach in particular provide critical support for a shift away from project-
based studies as the main research approach, which is limited in that it only captures 
snapshots of short-term learning benefits while making cross-institution comparisons very 
difficult. Furthermore, these technologies can accelerate the data collection and analysis 
cycle thus facilitating evaluation studies where findings be fed back to the project team at 
very short time frames thus increasing the potential impact of formative evaluation studies 
especially in cases were rapid prototyping of sections or complete exhibitions is required.  
 
quality of data collected by a person and data collected automatically through technology. 
An attempt to explore this question specifically has been the work of Baldwin and Kuriakose 
(2009) that provides encouraging preliminary evidence in favour of the technology. 
Nevertheless, further studies are required to consider the details especially in fully 
developed settings that fully account for the realities of museum fieldwork.  
 
design of a successful study especially considering the implications of BYOD. First, it is 
necessary to install recoding software on the visitor’s mobile device. This is greatly 
facilitated by the widespread availability of software distributions mechanisms such as 
Google Play and the App Store, which allow the seamless and familiar methods for the 
installation of the required software. However, this process also involves the provision of a 
privacy and security policy by the research team, which should be in line with guidelines for 
ethical research, and in any case adds an extra layer of complexity to the project as research 
need to ensure that it is both sufficient and comprehensive. In particular, the research team 

From a practical perspective, there are several decisions that must be made for the 

One question that merits further consideration at this stage is the comparative

should be prepared to address visitor concerns about possible intrusions of their privacy 
noting that personal devices typically store highly sensitive information that should not be 
addressed. We discuss this issue further in the following section. 

The choice of the specific mobile location-sensing technology employed depends on 

Similar to other research tools their successful use requires that they serve the 

the particular physical setting for the study, and of course whether tracking will take place 
outdoors or indoors. For example, the physical attributes of the exhibits displayed have 
significant bearing on the required accuracy for successful tracking: where exhibits extend 
over a large area, such as in zoos, lower accuracy systems could work well. Object displays 
with high item density would require high accuracy location sensing to differentiate 
between them and at very high densities would stretch the capabilities of any system for 
questions relating to specific objects rather than the display as a whole. The same factors of 
physical layout also influence the interpretation of the collected observations, for example 
assessing the level of engagement with a display meaningful inferring interaction requires 
proximal presence for a period exceeding a minimum time threshold or confirmation of the 
visitor orientation.  
 
exploration of the questions set out the study. We anticipate that in the medium term while 
the technologies become more usable their most effective use will be in a mixed approach 
where technology-based data collection can be incorporated into a comprehensive 
methodology that derives from specific research questions. 
 
7. Implications for Research Ethics 
Research ethics are central in any study involving human participants, yet the type and 
volume of data that is possible to capture and process using these technologies raises 
distinct issues (see also Raento et al 2009 for an extended discussion of this question 
specifically). Naturally, the first step in ameliorating such concerns is to carefully draft the 
study information sheet so as to clearly explain what data is collected and how, how it will 
be processed and anonymized. In particular, at this stage of their development it is more 
likely that researchers involved in data collection may not be familiar with the full 
implications of the use of this technology and for this reason it is necessary to incorporate 
targeted training in understanding data collection in this manner as well as related methods 
for the effective protection of participant anonymity and dealing with privacy issues.  
 
and other sensitive information and despite security measures already in place it is not 
uncommon that such information can be accessed (maliciously or unintentionally) or that 
visitors perceive a risk in this possibility. Such concerns are not unfounded and are 
reinforced by high-visibility incidents widely reported in the public press. Prevention of such 
incidents requires firstly careful technical development where appropriate and also 
awareness of these risks by the research team so that appropriate action is taken when 
necessary. To this end, all research team members must have access to a set of practical 

Personal mobile devices, a core ingredient of BYOD, invariably contain confidential

The feature of Big Data analytics that appears to cause most concerns is the high 

 
measures in the event of visitors experiencing problems as well as appropriate training in 
troubleshooting common problems or at least taking appropriate action. 
 
volume and precision of observations captured over an extended period of time. This issue 
extends beyond audience research as the availability of mobile location sensing creates 
wider opportunities for its exploitation and for a more detailed discussion we direct the 
reader to Duckham (2011). In the short-term visitor tracking is most likely to occur over a 
single visit, which limits the potential exposure for the visitor, but in case where longer 
longitudinal studies are attempted these issues directly affect research design and must be 
carefully considered. Although there are readily available tools that apply strong 
anonymization algorithms to protect privacy in this context, though it appears that the 
process can be reversed using newly designed techniques based on data triangulation 
(Machanavajjhala and Reiter, 2012)  
 
8. Conclusions 
In this paper we have attempted to explore the costs and benefits of employing mobile 
sensing, the BYOD approach and Big Data analytics to audience research. We find that these 
technologies combined create novel tools that extend the depth and breadth of possible 
studies while considerably reducing their cost and their demands on specialist human 
resources. Specifically we discover the following advantages: 
 

    Reduced  effort,  time  and  cost.  Data  collection  via  mobile  sensing  using  the 
visitors’  own  mobile  phone  significantly  reduces  the  need  for  direct 
involvement  by  researchers  who  can  focus  on  the  management  and 
supervision of the process.  

    Increased  detail.  Using  mobile  sensing  technology  visitor  positions  are 
recorded precisely and with undivided attention on each observation for the 
duration  of  the  visit.  Recording  captures  all  behaviors,  not  only  those 
deemed  of  relevance  at  the  time  of  observation.  This  focus  on  detail  is 
maintained  over  prolonged  periods  of  time  without  fatigue  affecting  data 
collectors’ performance. 

    Advanced Analytics. Audience researcher can benefit from a new generation 
of  so-called  Big  Data  technologies  that  allow  the  application  of  advanced 
machine  learning  and  visualization  techniques  potentially  revealing  new 
patterns and behaviours, especially those evolving over time, that cannot be 
captured by descriptive statistics. 

 
We consider the collection of tracking data with smartphones as the first step in a 
comprehensive programme of research in the use of mobile sensing and Big Data analytics 
for audience research. Several research groups including the authors are currently

Abstract: 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. In this paper, we highlight the costs and benefits of 
the application of these technologies to audience research through specific case studies set 
within varied museum environments. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 
experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. This paper also discusses the methodological, ethical and 
practical challenges emerging from the use of these technologies in the field as well as the 
limits of their application.

1. Introduction 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research1 methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. Indeed, the daily routine of most contemporary 
researchers would involve the use of databases and spreadsheets to manage and tabulate

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively 
recent additions to this set of tools and have further extended our ability to reach actual 
and potential audiences and improve the accuracy and detail of record keeping. Today, a 
new generation of mobile technology is rapidly becoming affordable and offers the 
opportunity to further develop the technology toolkit of audience research. Its core 
ingredients are the capability to automatically capture location and other sensor2 input from 
commodity consumer devices carried by visitors and use this information to conduct 
analyses through a new generation of machine learning and visualization techniques.  
 
the visitor at specific time intervals. In this way, it becomes possible to track visitors as they 
move through an exhibition or site without the active involvement of a researcher. There is 
however great variation in the capabilities of different technology alternatives to achieve 
this: when outdoors, visitors carrying a smartphone can be located using GPS to within a few 
meters of their actual position. When indoors, wireless networking infrastructure can be 
used to achieve the same goal also using the visitors’ mobile phone but at coarser accuracy. 
Location and time are the attributes of a visit that can be most easily recorded but are by no 
means the only: mobile sensing technology can also be used to infer the activities that the 
visitors are involved in, the ambience of their immediate surroundings, and in some cases 
their emotional and cognitive responses to their museum experience.  
Moreover, a current trend in information technology is towards consumerization in 
 
what is becoming known as the BYOD (Bring your Own Device) approach. BYOD advocates 
that IT in general and mobile sensing technology specifically is increasingly incorporated in 
consumer devices such as the mobile phones carried by visitors, and that such devices can 
be employed for the delivery of systems and applications offered by museums. For example, 
it is no longer necessary to provide a hardware-based audio or electronic guide to visitors 
but a museum can instead employ an app on the visitor’s own smartphone offering the 
same functionality thus significantly extending the availability of such applications. Indeed, 
according to a recent study by the Survey of American Alliance of Museums and the 
Museums Association in the UK, approximately half of the population in the USA and 
Western Europe are already users of smartphones (Fusion Research + Analytics 2012). These 
smartphones can also be employed to conduct audience research capturing rich data sets 
that are amenable to a new generation of analysis techniques, commonly referred to as Big 
Data analytics (Barton and Court 2012), which can provide new insights on the underlying 
patterns of behaviour. 
 
technologies to audience research through specific case studies set within varied museum 
environments, each employing technology that matches their particular requirements and 
characteristics. In each case, we also show examples of how the data has been analysed 
using modern Big Data techniques. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 

In this paper, we highlight the advantages and limitations of the application of these

experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the 
methodological, ethical and practical challenges emerging from the use of these 
technologies in the field as well as the limits of their application. Throughout, we are 
mindful that technology is only the enabler and that in many cases such tools would be one 
of several alternatives available to researchers who must make choices guided by 
appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.  
 
technical factors such as visibility of satellites (the more satellites are visible the higher 

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and 

 

Page 272 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
accuracy can be achieved), the quality of the receiver chip, atmospheric conditions, and sun 
activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).  
 
of the study and what their participation in it would involve. Forty-six families were 
approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main 
entrance. Participating families were asked to complete a PMM that was used to gather 
data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

Having completed the pre-visit PMM, families were then provided with a 

 
 
smartphone that was used to record their location for the full duration of their visit, which 
could last up to approximately five hours. Due to the fact that at the time smartphones 
were not as common as today, we opted to provide the same model device to all families so 
that the recorded location data would be of comparable quality. Specifically, we used the 
Openmoko Neo smartphone as our logging device integrating a precise Assisted-GPS unit 
with EGNOS functionality that achieves best accuracy in this locality. Tracking software was 
already installed and operational and the device was placed in a soft pouch that could be 
safely attached to a belt or placed inside a pocket or handbag. Visitor location was logged 
every second by a GPS unit integrated in the smartphone in order to have as detailed a 
record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

London Zoo study. The track has been superimposed the open source Open Street Maps system.

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time.

corresponding to the café area at the London Zoo. The statistics have been automatically calculated 
and displayed by the Audience Focus Analytics system. 
 
An alternative way to visually represent space occupancy is through the heatmap (cf. Figure 
3), a technique that superimposes colour intensities on locations to represent the relative 
length of visitor dwell times at those locations. Heatmaps are a common technique in Big 
Data analytics due to their effectiveness to visually communicate the relative frequency by 
which specific places are used and can help to quickly identify places of intense interest for 
visitors such as “hot” exhibits and how individuals group around them. For example, a quick 
visual inspection of Figure 3 reveals the main areas where the particular family spent most

of their time. This technique has also been used to analyses visitor traces at the site of the 
Minoan palace and city of Zakros, Crete, Greece (Chrysanthi  2012).

3. Coarse-grain Tracking Indoors 
GPS is an ideal solution for tracking and timing in many outdoors situations but building 
structures and the presence of large reflective surfaces in relatively close proximity to the 
receiver adversely affect the satellite signal. As a result, GPS measurements become 
unreliable in interior spaces and in most cases completely unusable so that alternatives 
must be considered. The implication is that it becomes necessary to deploy purpose-specific 
infrastructure usually at significant cost including installation, calibration and general 
maintenance and operation. Cost is directly related to the desired precision and accuracy, 
the exact exhibition characteristics and layout, and the types and sizes of the exhibits 
present. For a medium-sized museum expenditure would typically range from a few 
thousands to several hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
 
Tate Modern in the UK has used indoors location-sensing technology since the early 
2000s primarily as a means to adapt content presented by its multimedia guide and related 
mobile apps (Wilson 2004). The system employs the gallery’s wi-fi network and has been 
quite successful with visitors through applications such as the Magic Tate Ball, a location-
based game that promotes the exploration of the gallery’s collections. However, the 
technology has severe limitations in that it can only provide room-level accuracy. For this 
reason it has only been employed in rudimentary ways for audience research primarily to 
collect app usage and popularity data.  
 
the Louvre in Paris, France during 2011 (Yoshimura et al 2012). In this case Bluetooth, a 
Personal Area Networking technology, was employed to digitally mark a small number of 
prominent locations in the museum typically gateways between halls. At these locations 

An interesting study using similar indoors coarse-grain technology was carried out at

Bluetooth scanning stations were installed and were used to identify visitors crossing the 
gateway through the discovery of their mobile phones. Since the vast majority of mobile 
phones provide Bluetooth functionality this is generally an effective way to automate the 
process of visitor tracking. In fact, visitors can be traced across locations because Bluetooth 
scanning captures the unique identifier associated with the specific mobile phone carried by 
a particular individual. In this way it becomes possible to follow visitors when entering and 
exiting specific halls within the museum throughout their visit, information that can be 
employed to reconstruct the complete pathway they followed across the site. An alternative 
approach to the system adopted at the Louvre would be to use this technology to identify 
visitor proximity to specific landmark locations, for example specific exhibits, which have 
been instrumented with a scanning station. However, this is a less reliable technique in 
practice due to large timing variations in the device discovery process.

open source Depthmap software (UCL Space Group 2010). 
 
The Louvre study used a relatively low number of scanning locations but despite this 
limitation the advantages of this approach against manual data collection are still clear: it is 
possible to track considerably higher number of visitors thus offsetting the coarse-grain 
track reconstruction and produce interesting findings relating to visitor flow. The published 
paper on this study (Yoshimura et al 2012) offers few details of its findings from an audience 
research perspective primarily reporting on the practicalities of recording and the methods 
used to ensure accurate data capture. This approach is found to be both practical and 
relatively inexpensive and permits studies of longer duration for example by operating the 
scanning equipment continuously throughout the year. This would provide unique insights 
into the temporal dynamics of visiting over an extended period of time and would not have 
been realistic without the use of technology.

To show how such coarse-grain data can be used effectively to inform analyses of 

 
 
visitor flow, in Figure 4 we show the results of a feasibility study we conducted using similar 
Bluetooth technology in 2006 at the British Museum in London, UK. Figure 4 displays flow 
maps constructed using gateway counts and provides a visual representation of visitor flow 
through the site for example quickly identifying congested areas. This visualisation has been 
generated automatically from tracking data using the Depthmap software (Hillier and 
Tzortzi, 2006; UCL Space Group 2010), which can also produce animated sequences showing 
changes for instance in hourly patterns.  
Before concluding this section on coarse grain location sensing, we note that there 
 
are two very low-cost technologies in current use that could be used for the same purpose 
namely Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and QR bar codes. In both of these cases 
however, it is necessary that the visitors take action in order for their location to be 
recorded: In the case of RFID they have to bring their mobile phone to close proximity to the 
RFID tag marking the specific location of interest and in the case of QR they need to scan the 
bar code with the phone camera. Despite these rather severe limitations RFID has been 
used successfully to track visitor behaviour in a pioneering project at the Exploratorium (Hsi 
and Fait, 2005). QR codes have become very common in recent years and although their 
primary purpose is to provide smartphones with links to supplemental online information 
relating to exhibits, they can also be used to trace visitors (as long as they scan them) 
through an exhibition using standard web tracking software.

Gallery (courtesy Martin Tröndle). 
 
4. Fine-grain Tracking Indoors 
The state-of-the-art in mobile location sensing is Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology, which 
can provide location estimates with accuracy of a few centimetres as well as detect visitor 
orientation. Unfortunately, as with many new technologies, the cost of deployment is 
currently very high and requires the installation of mini-satellites covering the monitored 
space. Although in the vast majority of cases this technology would be prohibitively high for

                                        May 2014 

In any case, use of UWB location-sensing technology produced highly accurate tracks 

 
most museums, it was actually used for a study conducted in 2009 at the Art Museum of St. 
Gallen, Switzerland.  This work was made possible by a research grant and participation by a 
leading manufacturer of such systems, and was available as a temporary installation rather 
than a permanent feature of the gallery.  
 
of visitors while also correctly identifying orientation within the galleries. Figure 5 shows 
several of the tracks recorded in a particular gallery, which reveal a uniquely detailed 
tracking and timing data set exceeding the capabilities of any alternative indoor or outdoor 
system (Tröndle et al 2013). The data and additional bio-sensed attributes (cf. Section 4 
below) have been successfully used to quantify the level of engagement with works of art 
and explore its relationship to social interaction during the visit. Although clearly this 
technology is still generally not yet affordable for museums, in the long term the availability 
of data at very high accuracy and detail opens up distinct opportunities for example, in 
tracking visitors interactions at the individual artefact level. The National Maritime Museum 
in Greenwich, UK is one of the sites conducting such experiments with a permanent 
installation of UWB in a single of its recently redeveloped galleries. 
 
5. Other Sensing Modalities 
To be sure, location sensing is the most readily available mobile sensing technology and 
suitable for extensive use in audience research, but several other sensing modalities 
currently at different stages of maturity, offer interesting opportunities. Firstly, 
smartphones typically carry a dozen or so sensors5 that can be used to capture a variety of 
personal and environmental information: high quality three- and six-dimensional 
accelerometers have been used to infer user activities for example distinguishing between 
periods of standing, sitting and walking in which case the speed and gait can be estimated. 
Microphones are of course ubiquitous in all phones and have been used to capture 
fragments of visitor speech which when processed by suitable algorithms can infer the 
emotional state of the speakers and their levels of stress. These techniques are rapidly 
reaching maturity and will soon become adequately dependable in audience research. 
In our London Zoo study, we employed proximity sensors to measure spatial density, 
 
which can be used to provide a good estimate of crowding levels. In other projects we have 
experimented with a variety of environmental and biological sensors such as those 
measuring air quality and pollution, noise, ambient radiation, temperature, humidity, heart 
rate and skin conductance, all of which are widely available at very low price. An interesting 
use of bio-sensing was employed in the St. Gallen study discussed above, where skin sensors 
were used to measure skin conductance which is widely believed to indicate the emotional 
state of the carrier. More recently, mobile electroencephalographs have become affordable 
as they have been commoditised as game controllers, and can be easily used to measure 
cognitive activity and responses to particular experiences. This trend is accelerating and it is 
reasonable to expect mobile sensing devices to become commonplace in the short term, 
although this is not to say that their use does not pose a challenge for audience research.  

 

Page 279 

A final point in the current discussion relates to the inference of social interactions in 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
 
general and through the use of location or proximity data in particular. For example, when 
two or more visitors are tracked it is possible to deduce that they belong to the same group 
or that they are interacting at a particular time by observing the duration of their 
collocation. This heuristic has been successfully used in the study of social networks in a 
physical setting (Kostakos et al 2011) and is directly applicable for audience research. 
Typically, this requires the specification of a threshold on spatio-temporal co-presence that 
indicates that contact has occurred. There is further evidence to support this assumption 
and several related studies report success with this technique (Vu et al 2011).  
 
6. Methodological Considerations 
The design of any type of audience study is a balancing act whereby alternative 
methodologies must be weighed against the aims and research questions of the study as 
well as the time and resources available to complete it. While further practical experience 
with these technologies is crucial, we anticipate that the ability of mobile sensing 
technologies to collect Big Data sets from visitors at significantly reduced cost and effort 
makes large-scale and longitudinal studies decidedly easier to conduct. Technology may 
finally help overcome the financial barriers in conducting such studies, a long-standing but 
so far unattainable ambition of the field. The cost advantage of automating data collection 
and the BYOD approach in particular provide critical support for a shift away from project-
based studies as the main research approach, which is limited in that it only captures 
snapshots of short-term learning benefits while making cross-institution comparisons very 
difficult. Furthermore, these technologies can accelerate the data collection and analysis 
cycle thus facilitating evaluation studies where findings be fed back to the project team at 
very short time frames thus increasing the potential impact of formative evaluation studies 
especially in cases were rapid prototyping of sections or complete exhibitions is required.  
 
quality of data collected by a person and data collected automatically through technology. 
An attempt to explore this question specifically has been the work of Baldwin and Kuriakose 
(2009) that provides encouraging preliminary evidence in favour of the technology. 
Nevertheless, further studies are required to consider the details especially in fully 
developed settings that fully account for the realities of museum fieldwork.  
 
design of a successful study especially considering the implications of BYOD. First, it is 
necessary to install recoding software on the visitor’s mobile device. This is greatly 
facilitated by the widespread availability of software distributions mechanisms such as 
Google Play and the App Store, which allow the seamless and familiar methods for the 
installation of the required software. However, this process also involves the provision of a 
privacy and security policy by the research team, which should be in line with guidelines for 
ethical research, and in any case adds an extra layer of complexity to the project as research 
need to ensure that it is both sufficient and comprehensive. In particular, the research team 

From a practical perspective, there are several decisions that must be made for the 

One question that merits further consideration at this stage is the comparative

should be prepared to address visitor concerns about possible intrusions of their privacy 
noting that personal devices typically store highly sensitive information that should not be 
addressed. We discuss this issue further in the following section. 

The choice of the specific mobile location-sensing technology employed depends on 

Similar to other research tools their successful use requires that they serve the 

the particular physical setting for the study, and of course whether tracking will take place 
outdoors or indoors. For example, the physical attributes of the exhibits displayed have 
significant bearing on the required accuracy for successful tracking: where exhibits extend 
over a large area, such as in zoos, lower accuracy systems could work well. Object displays 
with high item density would require high accuracy location sensing to differentiate 
between them and at very high densities would stretch the capabilities of any system for 
questions relating to specific objects rather than the display as a whole. The same factors of 
physical layout also influence the interpretation of the collected observations, for example 
assessing the level of engagement with a display meaningful inferring interaction requires 
proximal presence for a period exceeding a minimum time threshold or confirmation of the 
visitor orientation.  
 
exploration of the questions set out the study. We anticipate that in the medium term while 
the technologies become more usable their most effective use will be in a mixed approach 
where technology-based data collection can be incorporated into a comprehensive 
methodology that derives from specific research questions. 
 
7. Implications for Research Ethics 
Research ethics are central in any study involving human participants, yet the type and 
volume of data that is possible to capture and process using these technologies raises 
distinct issues (see also Raento et al 2009 for an extended discussion of this question 
specifically). Naturally, the first step in ameliorating such concerns is to carefully draft the 
study information sheet so as to clearly explain what data is collected and how, how it will 
be processed and anonymized. In particular, at this stage of their development it is more 
likely that researchers involved in data collection may not be familiar with the full 
implications of the use of this technology and for this reason it is necessary to incorporate 
targeted training in understanding data collection in this manner as well as related methods 
for the effective protection of participant anonymity and dealing with privacy issues.  
 
and other sensitive information and despite security measures already in place it is not 
uncommon that such information can be accessed (maliciously or unintentionally) or that 
visitors perceive a risk in this possibility. Such concerns are not unfounded and are 
reinforced by high-visibility incidents widely reported in the public press. Prevention of such 
incidents requires firstly careful technical development where appropriate and also 
awareness of these risks by the research team so that appropriate action is taken when 
necessary. To this end, all research team members must have access to a set of practical 

Personal mobile devices, a core ingredient of BYOD, invariably contain confidential

The feature of Big Data analytics that appears to cause most concerns is the high 

 
measures in the event of visitors experiencing problems as well as appropriate training in 
troubleshooting common problems or at least taking appropriate action. 
 
volume and precision of observations captured over an extended period of time. This issue 
extends beyond audience research as the availability of mobile location sensing creates 
wider opportunities for its exploitation and for a more detailed discussion we direct the 
reader to Duckham (2011). In the short-term visitor tracking is most likely to occur over a 
single visit, which limits the potential exposure for the visitor, but in case where longer 
longitudinal studies are attempted these issues directly affect research design and must be 
carefully considered. Although there are readily available tools that apply strong 
anonymization algorithms to protect privacy in this context, though it appears that the 
process can be reversed using newly designed techniques based on data triangulation 
(Machanavajjhala and Reiter, 2012)  
 
8. Conclusions 
In this paper we have attempted to explore the costs and benefits of employing mobile 
sensing, the BYOD approach and Big Data analytics to audience research. We find that these 
technologies combined create novel tools that extend the depth and breadth of possible 
studies while considerably reducing their cost and their demands on specialist human 
resources. Specifically we discover the following advantages: 
 

    Reduced  effort,  time  and  cost.  Data  collection  via  mobile  sensing  using  the 
visitors’  own  mobile  phone  significantly  reduces  the  need  for  direct 
involvement  by  researchers  who  can  focus  on  the  management  and 
supervision of the process.  

    Increased  detail.  Using  mobile  sensing  technology  visitor  positions  are 
recorded precisely and with undivided attention on each observation for the 
duration  of  the  visit.  Recording  captures  all  behaviors,  not  only  those 
deemed  of  relevance  at  the  time  of  observation.  This  focus  on  detail  is 
maintained  over  prolonged  periods  of  time  without  fatigue  affecting  data 
collectors’ performance. 

    Advanced Analytics. Audience researcher can benefit from a new generation 
of  so-called  Big  Data  technologies  that  allow  the  application  of  advanced 
machine  learning  and  visualization  techniques  potentially  revealing  new 
patterns and behaviours, especially those evolving over time, that cannot be 
captured by descriptive statistics. 

 
We consider the collection of tracking data with smartphones as the first step in a 
comprehensive programme of research in the use of mobile sensing and Big Data analytics 
for audience research. Several research groups including the authors are currently

                                        May 2014 

The suitability of mobile technologies for audience research is related to their ability 

 
experimenting with a variety of sensing modalities and in the sort-term we anticipate the 
use of these technologies to augment the current generation of tracking and timing studies 
with the presentation of location-specific questionnaires provisioned on the visitor 
smartphone relating to specific aspects of the exhibition and/or their experience in a highly 
targeted manner.  
 
to capture the physicality of the experience.  Nevertheless, museums are increasingly 
present online providing experiences beyond simple information related to visiting and 
increasingly incorporating social media, collaborative authoring and content sharing 
including audio, video, still images and text captured or published by visitors before, after 
and during their visit become more influential. The combination of the digital footprint 
created through participation in online activities and trails followed during visits in the 
physical setting can potentially be combined to create powerful insights into behaviour 
across the two settings. This approach can be further extended to incorporate other settings 
and resources, beyond the museum, that visitors use as they pursue their interests and 
which can highlight different pathways to interest development and strategies of self-
directed learning.

Abstract: 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. In this paper, we highlight the costs and benefits of 
the application of these technologies to audience research through specific case studies set 
within varied museum environments. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 
experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. This paper also discusses the methodological, ethical and 
practical challenges emerging from the use of these technologies in the field as well as the 
limits of their application.

1. Introduction 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research1 methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. Indeed, the daily routine of most contemporary 
researchers would involve the use of databases and spreadsheets to manage and tabulate

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively 
recent additions to this set of tools and have further extended our ability to reach actual 
and potential audiences and improve the accuracy and detail of record keeping. Today, a 
new generation of mobile technology is rapidly becoming affordable and offers the 
opportunity to further develop the technology toolkit of audience research. Its core 
ingredients are the capability to automatically capture location and other sensor2 input from 
commodity consumer devices carried by visitors and use this information to conduct 
analyses through a new generation of machine learning and visualization techniques.  
 
the visitor at specific time intervals. In this way, it becomes possible to track visitors as they 
move through an exhibition or site without the active involvement of a researcher. There is 
however great variation in the capabilities of different technology alternatives to achieve 
this: when outdoors, visitors carrying a smartphone can be located using GPS to within a few 
meters of their actual position. When indoors, wireless networking infrastructure can be 
used to achieve the same goal also using the visitors’ mobile phone but at coarser accuracy. 
Location and time are the attributes of a visit that can be most easily recorded but are by no 
means the only: mobile sensing technology can also be used to infer the activities that the 
visitors are involved in, the ambience of their immediate surroundings, and in some cases 
their emotional and cognitive responses to their museum experience.  
Moreover, a current trend in information technology is towards consumerization in 
 
what is becoming known as the BYOD (Bring your Own Device) approach. BYOD advocates 
that IT in general and mobile sensing technology specifically is increasingly incorporated in 
consumer devices such as the mobile phones carried by visitors, and that such devices can 
be employed for the delivery of systems and applications offered by museums. For example, 
it is no longer necessary to provide a hardware-based audio or electronic guide to visitors 
but a museum can instead employ an app on the visitor’s own smartphone offering the 
same functionality thus significantly extending the availability of such applications. Indeed, 
according to a recent study by the Survey of American Alliance of Museums and the 
Museums Association in the UK, approximately half of the population in the USA and 
Western Europe are already users of smartphones (Fusion Research + Analytics 2012). These 
smartphones can also be employed to conduct audience research capturing rich data sets 
that are amenable to a new generation of analysis techniques, commonly referred to as Big 
Data analytics (Barton and Court 2012), which can provide new insights on the underlying 
patterns of behaviour. 
 
technologies to audience research through specific case studies set within varied museum 
environments, each employing technology that matches their particular requirements and 
characteristics. In each case, we also show examples of how the data has been analysed 
using modern Big Data techniques. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 

In this paper, we highlight the advantages and limitations of the application of these

experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the 
methodological, ethical and practical challenges emerging from the use of these 
technologies in the field as well as the limits of their application. Throughout, we are 
mindful that technology is only the enabler and that in many cases such tools would be one 
of several alternatives available to researchers who must make choices guided by 
appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.  
 
technical factors such as visibility of satellites (the more satellites are visible the higher 

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and 

 

Page 272 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
accuracy can be achieved), the quality of the receiver chip, atmospheric conditions, and sun 
activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).  
 
of the study and what their participation in it would involve. Forty-six families were 
approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main 
entrance. Participating families were asked to complete a PMM that was used to gather 
data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.

                                        May 2014 

Having completed the pre-visit PMM, families were then provided with a 

 
 
smartphone that was used to record their location for the full duration of their visit, which 
could last up to approximately five hours. Due to the fact that at the time smartphones 
were not as common as today, we opted to provide the same model device to all families so 
that the recorded location data would be of comparable quality. Specifically, we used the 
Openmoko Neo smartphone as our logging device integrating a precise Assisted-GPS unit 
with EGNOS functionality that achieves best accuracy in this locality. Tracking software was 
already installed and operational and the device was placed in a soft pouch that could be 
safely attached to a belt or placed inside a pocket or handbag. Visitor location was logged 
every second by a GPS unit integrated in the smartphone in order to have as detailed a 
record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time.

corresponding to the café area at the London Zoo. The statistics have been automatically calculated 
and displayed by the Audience Focus Analytics system. 
 
An alternative way to visually represent space occupancy is through the heatmap (cf. Figure 
3), a technique that superimposes colour intensities on locations to represent the relative 
length of visitor dwell times at those locations. Heatmaps are a common technique in Big 
Data analytics due to their effectiveness to visually communicate the relative frequency by 
which specific places are used and can help to quickly identify places of intense interest for 
visitors such as “hot” exhibits and how individuals group around them. For example, a quick 
visual inspection of Figure 3 reveals the main areas where the particular family spent most

of their time. This technique has also been used to analyses visitor traces at the site of the 
Minoan palace and city of Zakros, Crete, Greece (Chrysanthi  2012).

3. Coarse-grain Tracking Indoors 
GPS is an ideal solution for tracking and timing in many outdoors situations but building 
structures and the presence of large reflective surfaces in relatively close proximity to the 
receiver adversely affect the satellite signal. As a result, GPS measurements become 
unreliable in interior spaces and in most cases completely unusable so that alternatives 
must be considered. The implication is that it becomes necessary to deploy purpose-specific 
infrastructure usually at significant cost including installation, calibration and general 
maintenance and operation. Cost is directly related to the desired precision and accuracy, 
the exact exhibition characteristics and layout, and the types and sizes of the exhibits 
present. For a medium-sized museum expenditure would typically range from a few 
thousands to several hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
 
Tate Modern in the UK has used indoors location-sensing technology since the early 
2000s primarily as a means to adapt content presented by its multimedia guide and related 
mobile apps (Wilson 2004). The system employs the gallery’s wi-fi network and has been 
quite successful with visitors through applications such as the Magic Tate Ball, a location-
based game that promotes the exploration of the gallery’s collections. However, the 
technology has severe limitations in that it can only provide room-level accuracy. For this 
reason it has only been employed in rudimentary ways for audience research primarily to 
collect app usage and popularity data.  
 
the Louvre in Paris, France during 2011 (Yoshimura et al 2012). In this case Bluetooth, a 
Personal Area Networking technology, was employed to digitally mark a small number of 
prominent locations in the museum typically gateways between halls. At these locations 

An interesting study using similar indoors coarse-grain technology was carried out at 

 

Page 276 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
Bluetooth scanning stations were installed and were used to identify visitors crossing the 
gateway through the discovery of their mobile phones. Since the vast majority of mobile 
phones provide Bluetooth functionality this is generally an effective way to automate the 
process of visitor tracking. In fact, visitors can be traced across locations because Bluetooth 
scanning captures the unique identifier associated with the specific mobile phone carried by 
a particular individual. In this way it becomes possible to follow visitors when entering and 
exiting specific halls within the museum throughout their visit, information that can be 
employed to reconstruct the complete pathway they followed across the site. An alternative 
approach to the system adopted at the Louvre would be to use this technology to identify 
visitor proximity to specific landmark locations, for example specific exhibits, which have 
been instrumented with a scanning station. However, this is a less reliable technique in 
practice due to large timing variations in the device discovery process.

open source Depthmap software (UCL Space Group 2010). 
 
The Louvre study used a relatively low number of scanning locations but despite this 
limitation the advantages of this approach against manual data collection are still clear: it is 
possible to track considerably higher number of visitors thus offsetting the coarse-grain 
track reconstruction and produce interesting findings relating to visitor flow. The published 
paper on this study (Yoshimura et al 2012) offers few details of its findings from an audience 
research perspective primarily reporting on the practicalities of recording and the methods 
used to ensure accurate data capture. This approach is found to be both practical and 
relatively inexpensive and permits studies of longer duration for example by operating the 
scanning equipment continuously throughout the year. This would provide unique insights 
into the temporal dynamics of visiting over an extended period of time and would not have 
been realistic without the use of technology.

                                        May 2014 

To show how such coarse-grain data can be used effectively to inform analyses of 

 
 
visitor flow, in Figure 4 we show the results of a feasibility study we conducted using similar 
Bluetooth technology in 2006 at the British Museum in London, UK. Figure 4 displays flow 
maps constructed using gateway counts and provides a visual representation of visitor flow 
through the site for example quickly identifying congested areas. This visualisation has been 
generated automatically from tracking data using the Depthmap software (Hillier and 
Tzortzi, 2006; UCL Space Group 2010), which can also produce animated sequences showing 
changes for instance in hourly patterns.  
Before concluding this section on coarse grain location sensing, we note that there 
 
are two very low-cost technologies in current use that could be used for the same purpose 
namely Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and QR bar codes. In both of these cases 
however, it is necessary that the visitors take action in order for their location to be 
recorded: In the case of RFID they have to bring their mobile phone to close proximity to the 
RFID tag marking the specific location of interest and in the case of QR they need to scan the 
bar code with the phone camera. Despite these rather severe limitations RFID has been 
used successfully to track visitor behaviour in a pioneering project at the Exploratorium (Hsi 
and Fait, 2005). QR codes have become very common in recent years and although their 
primary purpose is to provide smartphones with links to supplemental online information 
relating to exhibits, they can also be used to trace visitors (as long as they scan them) 
through an exhibition using standard web tracking software.

Gallery (courtesy Martin Tröndle). 
 
4. Fine-grain Tracking Indoors 
The state-of-the-art in mobile location sensing is Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology, which 
can provide location estimates with accuracy of a few centimetres as well as detect visitor 
orientation. Unfortunately, as with many new technologies, the cost of deployment is 
currently very high and requires the installation of mini-satellites covering the monitored 
space. Although in the vast majority of cases this technology would be prohibitively high for 

 

Page 278 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

In any case, use of UWB location-sensing technology produced highly accurate tracks 

 
most museums, it was actually used for a study conducted in 2009 at the Art Museum of St. 
Gallen, Switzerland.  This work was made possible by a research grant and participation by a 
leading manufacturer of such systems, and was available as a temporary installation rather 
than a permanent feature of the gallery.  
 
of visitors while also correctly identifying orientation within the galleries. Figure 5 shows 
several of the tracks recorded in a particular gallery, which reveal a uniquely detailed 
tracking and timing data set exceeding the capabilities of any alternative indoor or outdoor 
system (Tröndle et al 2013). The data and additional bio-sensed attributes (cf. Section 4 
below) have been successfully used to quantify the level of engagement with works of art 
and explore its relationship to social interaction during the visit. Although clearly this 
technology is still generally not yet affordable for museums, in the long term the availability 
of data at very high accuracy and detail opens up distinct opportunities for example, in 
tracking visitors interactions at the individual artefact level. The National Maritime Museum 
in Greenwich, UK is one of the sites conducting such experiments with a permanent 
installation of UWB in a single of its recently redeveloped galleries. 
 
5. Other Sensing Modalities 
To be sure, location sensing is the most readily available mobile sensing technology and 
suitable for extensive use in audience research, but several other sensing modalities 
currently at different stages of maturity, offer interesting opportunities. Firstly, 
smartphones typically carry a dozen or so sensors5 that can be used to capture a variety of 
personal and environmental information: high quality three- and six-dimensional 
accelerometers have been used to infer user activities for example distinguishing between 
periods of standing, sitting and walking in which case the speed and gait can be estimated. 
Microphones are of course ubiquitous in all phones and have been used to capture 
fragments of visitor speech which when processed by suitable algorithms can infer the 
emotional state of the speakers and their levels of stress. These techniques are rapidly 
reaching maturity and will soon become adequately dependable in audience research. 
In our London Zoo study, we employed proximity sensors to measure spatial density, 
 
which can be used to provide a good estimate of crowding levels. In other projects we have 
experimented with a variety of environmental and biological sensors such as those 
measuring air quality and pollution, noise, ambient radiation, temperature, humidity, heart 
rate and skin conductance, all of which are widely available at very low price. An interesting 
use of bio-sensing was employed in the St. Gallen study discussed above, where skin sensors 
were used to measure skin conductance which is widely believed to indicate the emotional 
state of the carrier. More recently, mobile electroencephalographs have become affordable 
as they have been commoditised as game controllers, and can be easily used to measure 
cognitive activity and responses to particular experiences. This trend is accelerating and it is 
reasonable to expect mobile sensing devices to become commonplace in the short term, 
although this is not to say that their use does not pose a challenge for audience research.  

 

Page 279 

A final point in the current discussion relates to the inference of social interactions in 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
 
general and through the use of location or proximity data in particular. For example, when 
two or more visitors are tracked it is possible to deduce that they belong to the same group 
or that they are interacting at a particular time by observing the duration of their 
collocation. This heuristic has been successfully used in the study of social networks in a 
physical setting (Kostakos et al 2011) and is directly applicable for audience research. 
Typically, this requires the specification of a threshold on spatio-temporal co-presence that 
indicates that contact has occurred. There is further evidence to support this assumption 
and several related studies report success with this technique (Vu et al 2011).  
 
6. Methodological Considerations 
The design of any type of audience study is a balancing act whereby alternative 
methodologies must be weighed against the aims and research questions of the study as 
well as the time and resources available to complete it. While further practical experience 
with these technologies is crucial, we anticipate that the ability of mobile sensing 
technologies to collect Big Data sets from visitors at significantly reduced cost and effort 
makes large-scale and longitudinal studies decidedly easier to conduct. Technology may 
finally help overcome the financial barriers in conducting such studies, a long-standing but 
so far unattainable ambition of the field. The cost advantage of automating data collection 
and the BYOD approach in particular provide critical support for a shift away from project-
based studies as the main research approach, which is limited in that it only captures 
snapshots of short-term learning benefits while making cross-institution comparisons very 
difficult. Furthermore, these technologies can accelerate the data collection and analysis 
cycle thus facilitating evaluation studies where findings be fed back to the project team at 
very short time frames thus increasing the potential impact of formative evaluation studies 
especially in cases were rapid prototyping of sections or complete exhibitions is required.  
 
quality of data collected by a person and data collected automatically through technology. 
An attempt to explore this question specifically has been the work of Baldwin and Kuriakose 
(2009) that provides encouraging preliminary evidence in favour of the technology. 
Nevertheless, further studies are required to consider the details especially in fully 
developed settings that fully account for the realities of museum fieldwork.  
 
design of a successful study especially considering the implications of BYOD. First, it is 
necessary to install recoding software on the visitor’s mobile device. This is greatly 
facilitated by the widespread availability of software distributions mechanisms such as 
Google Play and the App Store, which allow the seamless and familiar methods for the 
installation of the required software. However, this process also involves the provision of a 
privacy and security policy by the research team, which should be in line with guidelines for 
ethical research, and in any case adds an extra layer of complexity to the project as research 
need to ensure that it is both sufficient and comprehensive. In particular, the research team 

From a practical perspective, there are several decisions that must be made for the 

One question that merits further consideration at this stage is the comparative 

 

Page 280

                                        May 2014 

 
should be prepared to address visitor concerns about possible intrusions of their privacy 
noting that personal devices typically store highly sensitive information that should not be 
addressed. We discuss this issue further in the following section. 

The choice of the specific mobile location-sensing technology employed depends on 

Similar to other research tools their successful use requires that they serve the 

the particular physical setting for the study, and of course whether tracking will take place 
outdoors or indoors. For example, the physical attributes of the exhibits displayed have 
significant bearing on the required accuracy for successful tracking: where exhibits extend 
over a large area, such as in zoos, lower accuracy systems could work well. Object displays 
with high item density would require high accuracy location sensing to differentiate 
between them and at very high densities would stretch the capabilities of any system for 
questions relating to specific objects rather than the display as a whole. The same factors of 
physical layout also influence the interpretation of the collected observations, for example 
assessing the level of engagement with a display meaningful inferring interaction requires 
proximal presence for a period exceeding a minimum time threshold or confirmation of the 
visitor orientation.  
 
exploration of the questions set out the study. We anticipate that in the medium term while 
the technologies become more usable their most effective use will be in a mixed approach 
where technology-based data collection can be incorporated into a comprehensive 
methodology that derives from specific research questions. 
 
7. Implications for Research Ethics 
Research ethics are central in any study involving human participants, yet the type and 
volume of data that is possible to capture and process using these technologies raises 
distinct issues (see also Raento et al 2009 for an extended discussion of this question 
specifically). Naturally, the first step in ameliorating such concerns is to carefully draft the 
study information sheet so as to clearly explain what data is collected and how, how it will 
be processed and anonymized. In particular, at this stage of their development it is more 
likely that researchers involved in data collection may not be familiar with the full 
implications of the use of this technology and for this reason it is necessary to incorporate 
targeted training in understanding data collection in this manner as well as related methods 
for the effective protection of participant anonymity and dealing with privacy issues.  
 
and other sensitive information and despite security measures already in place it is not 
uncommon that such information can be accessed (maliciously or unintentionally) or that 
visitors perceive a risk in this possibility. Such concerns are not unfounded and are 
reinforced by high-visibility incidents widely reported in the public press. Prevention of such 
incidents requires firstly careful technical development where appropriate and also 
awareness of these risks by the research team so that appropriate action is taken when 
necessary. To this end, all research team members must have access to a set of practical 

Personal mobile devices, a core ingredient of BYOD, invariably contain confidential

The feature of Big Data analytics that appears to cause most concerns is the high 

 
measures in the event of visitors experiencing problems as well as appropriate training in 
troubleshooting common problems or at least taking appropriate action. 
 
volume and precision of observations captured over an extended period of time. This issue 
extends beyond audience research as the availability of mobile location sensing creates 
wider opportunities for its exploitation and for a more detailed discussion we direct the 
reader to Duckham (2011). In the short-term visitor tracking is most likely to occur over a 
single visit, which limits the potential exposure for the visitor, but in case where longer 
longitudinal studies are attempted these issues directly affect research design and must be 
carefully considered. Although there are readily available tools that apply strong 
anonymization algorithms to protect privacy in this context, though it appears that the 
process can be reversed using newly designed techniques based on data triangulation 
(Machanavajjhala and Reiter, 2012)  
 
8. Conclusions 
In this paper we have attempted to explore the costs and benefits of employing mobile 
sensing, the BYOD approach and Big Data analytics to audience research. We find that these 
technologies combined create novel tools that extend the depth and breadth of possible 
studies while considerably reducing their cost and their demands on specialist human 
resources. Specifically we discover the following advantages: 
 

    Reduced  effort,  time  and  cost.  Data  collection  via  mobile  sensing  using  the 
visitors’  own  mobile  phone  significantly  reduces  the  need  for  direct 
involvement  by  researchers  who  can  focus  on  the  management  and 
supervision of the process.  

    Increased  detail.  Using  mobile  sensing  technology  visitor  positions  are 
recorded precisely and with undivided attention on each observation for the 
duration  of  the  visit.  Recording  captures  all  behaviors,  not  only  those 
deemed  of  relevance  at  the  time  of  observation.  This  focus  on  detail  is 
maintained  over  prolonged  periods  of  time  without  fatigue  affecting  data 
collectors’ performance. 

    Advanced Analytics. Audience researcher can benefit from a new generation 
of  so-called  Big  Data  technologies  that  allow  the  application  of  advanced 
machine  learning  and  visualization  techniques  potentially  revealing  new 
patterns and behaviours, especially those evolving over time, that cannot be 
captured by descriptive statistics. 

 
We consider the collection of tracking data with smartphones as the first step in a 
comprehensive programme of research in the use of mobile sensing and Big Data analytics 
for audience research. Several research groups including the authors are currently

                                        May 2014 

The suitability of mobile technologies for audience research is related to their ability 

 
experimenting with a variety of sensing modalities and in the sort-term we anticipate the 
use of these technologies to augment the current generation of tracking and timing studies 
with the presentation of location-specific questionnaires provisioned on the visitor 
smartphone relating to specific aspects of the exhibition and/or their experience in a highly 
targeted manner.  
 
to capture the physicality of the experience.  Nevertheless, museums are increasingly 
present online providing experiences beyond simple information related to visiting and 
increasingly incorporating social media, collaborative authoring and content sharing 
including audio, video, still images and text captured or published by visitors before, after 
and during their visit become more influential. The combination of the digital footprint 
created through participation in online activities and trails followed during visits in the 
physical setting can potentially be combined to create powerful insights into behaviour 
across the two settings. This approach can be further extended to incorporate other settings 
and resources, beyond the museum, that visitors use as they pursue their interests and 
which can highlight different pathways to interest development and strategies of self-
directed learning.

Abstract: 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. In this paper, we highlight the costs and benefits of 
the application of these technologies to audience research through specific case studies set 
within varied museum environments. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 
experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. This paper also discusses the methodological, ethical and 
practical challenges emerging from the use of these technologies in the field as well as the 
limits of their application.

1. Introduction 
Over the past four decades, varied information technology and communication tools were 
incorporated in standard audience research1 methodologies thus becoming a ubiquitous 
feature of fieldwork and data analysis. Indeed, the daily routine of most contemporary 
researchers would involve the use of databases and spreadsheets to manage and tabulate

The most common type of mobile sensing enables the recording of the location of 

 
data, or statistical and text processing software for quantitative and qualitative analysis 
respectively. Web-based surveys and mobile logging systems for tracking are relatively 
recent additions to this set of tools and have further extended our ability to reach actual 
and potential audiences and improve the accuracy and detail of record keeping. Today, a 
new generation of mobile technology is rapidly becoming affordable and offers the 
opportunity to further develop the technology toolkit of audience research. Its core 
ingredients are the capability to automatically capture location and other sensor2 input from 
commodity consumer devices carried by visitors and use this information to conduct 
analyses through a new generation of machine learning and visualization techniques.  
 
the visitor at specific time intervals. In this way, it becomes possible to track visitors as they 
move through an exhibition or site without the active involvement of a researcher. There is 
however great variation in the capabilities of different technology alternatives to achieve 
this: when outdoors, visitors carrying a smartphone can be located using GPS to within a few 
meters of their actual position. When indoors, wireless networking infrastructure can be 
used to achieve the same goal also using the visitors’ mobile phone but at coarser accuracy. 
Location and time are the attributes of a visit that can be most easily recorded but are by no 
means the only: mobile sensing technology can also be used to infer the activities that the 
visitors are involved in, the ambience of their immediate surroundings, and in some cases 
their emotional and cognitive responses to their museum experience.  
Moreover, a current trend in information technology is towards consumerization in 
 
what is becoming known as the BYOD (Bring your Own Device) approach. BYOD advocates 
that IT in general and mobile sensing technology specifically is increasingly incorporated in 
consumer devices such as the mobile phones carried by visitors, and that such devices can 
be employed for the delivery of systems and applications offered by museums. For example, 
it is no longer necessary to provide a hardware-based audio or electronic guide to visitors 
but a museum can instead employ an app on the visitor’s own smartphone offering the 
same functionality thus significantly extending the availability of such applications. Indeed, 
according to a recent study by the Survey of American Alliance of Museums and the 
Museums Association in the UK, approximately half of the population in the USA and 
Western Europe are already users of smartphones (Fusion Research + Analytics 2012). These 
smartphones can also be employed to conduct audience research capturing rich data sets 
that are amenable to a new generation of analysis techniques, commonly referred to as Big 
Data analytics (Barton and Court 2012), which can provide new insights on the underlying 
patterns of behaviour. 
 
technologies to audience research through specific case studies set within varied museum 
environments, each employing technology that matches their particular requirements and 
characteristics. In each case, we also show examples of how the data has been analysed 
using modern Big Data techniques. Collectively the findings of these studies suggest that 
mobile sensing supports the acquisition of richer and deeper data sets relating to the visitor 

In this paper, we highlight the advantages and limitations of the application of these

experience that can potentially reveal a greater diversity of patterns of visitor behaviour as 
well as the changing dynamics of visiting over time. This can considerably extend our 
capability to conduct audience research and rethink the way museums conceptualize and 
deliver their interpretation. Owing to the ability of this technology to be used both to 
provide interpretation and to collect visitor location data, it has the potential to embed 
audience research  in the development of spaces and experiences and hence to provide 
organisations with access to information that can support on-going learning and decision 
making (often called ‘thinking evaluatively’). In this paper, we also identify the 
methodological, ethical and practical challenges emerging from the use of these 
technologies in the field as well as the limits of their application. Throughout, we are 
mindful that technology is only the enabler and that in many cases such tools would be one 
of several alternatives available to researchers who must make choices guided by 
appropriateness for the investigation of specific research questions.  
 
2. Tracking and Timing Outdoors 
Location is the most common sensing modality readily available in a variety of consumer 
mobile devices. Smartphones in particular typically integrate multiple location-sensing 
technologies several of which we discuss in this and following sections. Location information 
can be absolute that is, reported with reference to a global coordinate system for example, 
latitude and longitude pairs. Or it can be relative in that it is expressed in relation to specific 
landmarks for example, twenty metres south from the London Zoo entrance. It can be 
expressed either numerically for example, 51 degrees North by 0.19 degrees West, or 
symbolically for example, “at the Zoo entrance gate.” Each location sensing system is also 
characterised by its accuracy and precision: Accuracy refers to the distance between the 
reported position and the actual location where the calculation is carried out or else the 
error in the calculation of this estimate for example, five metres from the actual position. 
Precision refers to the percentage of time that is, how often we can expect to achieve this 
accuracy for example 98 per cent of the time better than two metres accuracy is achieved. 
 
The most common location sensing system in current use is the Global Positioning 
System commonly referred to as GPS (LaMarca and de Lara 2008). GPS has been in 
operation since the late 1970s and consists of a constellation of satellites, which regularly 
transmit signals incorporating identification and timing information.3 GPS receivers estimate 
their position through a process called triangulation by combining distance and time 
measurements from different satellites that are used as reference points. Receivers carry 
out these calculations independently and need not communicate back to the satellites or 
any other communications infrastructure. Such devices have become common in 
smartphones and other consumer electronics due to their low cost and their compact 
packaging for example, a typical receiver chip would measure just a few square centimetres 
and cost a few dozen dollars.  
 
technical factors such as visibility of satellites (the more satellites are visible the higher 

GPS accuracy and precision depends on a large number of environmental and 

 

Page 272

                                        May 2014 

 
accuracy can be achieved), the quality of the receiver chip, atmospheric conditions, and sun 
activity. It is, thus, difficult to provide a figure for these attributes that would hold true 
under all circumstances. Having said that, when a typical smart phone receiver is used in 
North America and Europe, one can expect a few metres accuracy most of the time when 
used at open spaces. Access to supplemental satellite systems can further improve 
performance, for example receivers that augment GPS through the WAAS system in the UK 
can improve their accuracy to about one metre and over 99 per cent precision.  
 
2.1 Tracking Visitors with GPS at the London Zoo 
In a recent study we conducted during the spring of 2009 at the London Zoo in the UK, we 
employed GPS as part of our empirical examination of family visitor motivation and usage 
patterns. We employed a naturalistic approach combining self-reporting methods, 
specifically Personal Meaning Mapping (PMM), informal interviews, and tracking. We were 
able to combine the PMM and interview data with visitor trails to associate motivations for 
visiting and spatial behaviour (Moussouri and Roussos 2013).  
 
of the study and what their participation in it would involve. Forty-six families were 
approached as they were queuing to enter the Zoo and gave their consent to take part in 
the study. Out of the total of forty-six participating families, forty-three groups (130 
individuals) completed all elements of the study. Of those, we have complete data sets (i.e., 
paired PMM and complete GPS traces) for thirty eight families (90 individuals). All age 
groups were represented in the group of participants (see Table 1).

Families were offered free entrance and were escorted to a sitting area near the main 
entrance. Participating families were asked to complete a PMM that was used to gather 
data about their prior knowledge, interests, imagined visit routes, and expectations of what 
family members would be able to do and see individually and as a group. In the informal 
interview that followed, all family members were asked their reasons for visiting. Often this 
information was also included in their PMM, in which case we prompted them to give more 
information.  

 

Page 273 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

Having completed the pre-visit PMM, families were then provided with a 

 
 
smartphone that was used to record their location for the full duration of their visit, which 
could last up to approximately five hours. Due to the fact that at the time smartphones 
were not as common as today, we opted to provide the same model device to all families so 
that the recorded location data would be of comparable quality. Specifically, we used the 
Openmoko Neo smartphone as our logging device integrating a precise Assisted-GPS unit 
with EGNOS functionality that achieves best accuracy in this locality. Tracking software was 
already installed and operational and the device was placed in a soft pouch that could be 
safely attached to a belt or placed inside a pocket or handbag. Visitor location was logged 
every second by a GPS unit integrated in the smartphone in order to have as detailed a 
record as possible.  
 
location but no fixed time was given for this. Families were free to choose when to 
terminate their visit and the purpose for the meeting was for the return of the device. After 
recruiting families the researcher would proceed to the agreed meeting place and wait for 
their return, at which point they were asked whether they were willing to continue the 
discussion.  Once visitors had agreed to be interviewed, the exact same procedures used in 
the pre-visit data collection were repeated.  At the end of the visit, visitors were asked to re-
visit their PMM and add or modify any aspect they wished. The post-visit PMM captured 
information related to changes in knowledge and interests, reconstructed visit routes and 
the extent to which expectations were met. Three out of the forty-six participating families 
were not able to complete the post-visit PMM, due to time constraints, and were excluded 
from the study. 
 

Subsequently arrangements were made to meet the family visitors at a specified

London Zoo study. The track has been superimposed the open source Open Street Maps system.

The recorded data were used to reconstruct time-ordered sequences of locations visited (cf. 
Figure 1) and from these sequences we were able to infer different elements of the visitor’s 
spatial behaviour, for example their presence at particular places and their interactions with 
specific exhibits. The tracking information provided a rich data set which we investigated 
using the Big Data analytics system developed by Audience Focus specifically for this 
purpose (Kostakos et.al. 2011, Papadogkonas et.al. 2008). Firstly, the usual descriptive 
statistics for tracking and timing studies (Yalowitz and Bronnenkant 2009) were calculated 
noting that because the captured data were already in a machine-readable form there was 
no need for manual transcription, a fact that facilitated the processing of considerably larger 
quantity of data. Contrary to the specialised but highly complex tools provided by 
commercial and open source systems such as Oracle Spatial and ArcGIS, and PostGIS, QGIS 
and OSGEO4 respectively, this software has been designed to cater to the typical workflow 
of audience research thus supporting advanced spatial statistical processing via an intuitive 
interface. Figure 2 shows the annotated map representing particular areas of interest at the 
London Zoo and statistics associated with one of these locations such as number of visitors 
and average dwell time.

corresponding to the café area at the London Zoo. The statistics have been automatically calculated 
and displayed by the Audience Focus Analytics system. 
 
An alternative way to visually represent space occupancy is through the heatmap (cf. Figure 
3), a technique that superimposes colour intensities on locations to represent the relative 
length of visitor dwell times at those locations. Heatmaps are a common technique in Big 
Data analytics due to their effectiveness to visually communicate the relative frequency by 
which specific places are used and can help to quickly identify places of intense interest for 
visitors such as “hot” exhibits and how individuals group around them. For example, a quick 
visual inspection of Figure 3 reveals the main areas where the particular family spent most

of their time. This technique has also been used to analyses visitor traces at the site of the 
Minoan palace and city of Zakros, Crete, Greece (Chrysanthi  2012).

3. Coarse-grain Tracking Indoors 
GPS is an ideal solution for tracking and timing in many outdoors situations but building 
structures and the presence of large reflective surfaces in relatively close proximity to the 
receiver adversely affect the satellite signal. As a result, GPS measurements become 
unreliable in interior spaces and in most cases completely unusable so that alternatives 
must be considered. The implication is that it becomes necessary to deploy purpose-specific 
infrastructure usually at significant cost including installation, calibration and general 
maintenance and operation. Cost is directly related to the desired precision and accuracy, 
the exact exhibition characteristics and layout, and the types and sizes of the exhibits 
present. For a medium-sized museum expenditure would typically range from a few 
thousands to several hundreds of thousands of dollars.  
 
Tate Modern in the UK has used indoors location-sensing technology since the early 
2000s primarily as a means to adapt content presented by its multimedia guide and related 
mobile apps (Wilson 2004). The system employs the gallery’s wi-fi network and has been 
quite successful with visitors through applications such as the Magic Tate Ball, a location-
based game that promotes the exploration of the gallery’s collections. However, the 
technology has severe limitations in that it can only provide room-level accuracy. For this 
reason it has only been employed in rudimentary ways for audience research primarily to 
collect app usage and popularity data.  
 
the Louvre in Paris, France during 2011 (Yoshimura et al 2012). In this case Bluetooth, a 
Personal Area Networking technology, was employed to digitally mark a small number of 
prominent locations in the museum typically gateways between halls. At these locations 

An interesting study using similar indoors coarse-grain technology was carried out at 

 

Page 276 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
Bluetooth scanning stations were installed and were used to identify visitors crossing the 
gateway through the discovery of their mobile phones. Since the vast majority of mobile 
phones provide Bluetooth functionality this is generally an effective way to automate the 
process of visitor tracking. In fact, visitors can be traced across locations because Bluetooth 
scanning captures the unique identifier associated with the specific mobile phone carried by 
a particular individual. In this way it becomes possible to follow visitors when entering and 
exiting specific halls within the museum throughout their visit, information that can be 
employed to reconstruct the complete pathway they followed across the site. An alternative 
approach to the system adopted at the Louvre would be to use this technology to identify 
visitor proximity to specific landmark locations, for example specific exhibits, which have 
been instrumented with a scanning station. However, this is a less reliable technique in 
practice due to large timing variations in the device discovery process.

open source Depthmap software (UCL Space Group 2010). 
 
The Louvre study used a relatively low number of scanning locations but despite this 
limitation the advantages of this approach against manual data collection are still clear: it is 
possible to track considerably higher number of visitors thus offsetting the coarse-grain 
track reconstruction and produce interesting findings relating to visitor flow. The published 
paper on this study (Yoshimura et al 2012) offers few details of its findings from an audience 
research perspective primarily reporting on the practicalities of recording and the methods 
used to ensure accurate data capture. This approach is found to be both practical and 
relatively inexpensive and permits studies of longer duration for example by operating the 
scanning equipment continuously throughout the year. This would provide unique insights 
into the temporal dynamics of visiting over an extended period of time and would not have 
been realistic without the use of technology.

                                        May 2014 

To show how such coarse-grain data can be used effectively to inform analyses of 

 
 
visitor flow, in Figure 4 we show the results of a feasibility study we conducted using similar 
Bluetooth technology in 2006 at the British Museum in London, UK. Figure 4 displays flow 
maps constructed using gateway counts and provides a visual representation of visitor flow 
through the site for example quickly identifying congested areas. This visualisation has been 
generated automatically from tracking data using the Depthmap software (Hillier and 
Tzortzi, 2006; UCL Space Group 2010), which can also produce animated sequences showing 
changes for instance in hourly patterns.  
Before concluding this section on coarse grain location sensing, we note that there 
 
are two very low-cost technologies in current use that could be used for the same purpose 
namely Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and QR bar codes. In both of these cases 
however, it is necessary that the visitors take action in order for their location to be 
recorded: In the case of RFID they have to bring their mobile phone to close proximity to the 
RFID tag marking the specific location of interest and in the case of QR they need to scan the 
bar code with the phone camera. Despite these rather severe limitations RFID has been 
used successfully to track visitor behaviour in a pioneering project at the Exploratorium (Hsi 
and Fait, 2005). QR codes have become very common in recent years and although their 
primary purpose is to provide smartphones with links to supplemental online information 
relating to exhibits, they can also be used to trace visitors (as long as they scan them) 
through an exhibition using standard web tracking software.

Gallery (courtesy Martin Tröndle). 
 
4. Fine-grain Tracking Indoors 
The state-of-the-art in mobile location sensing is Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology, which 
can provide location estimates with accuracy of a few centimetres as well as detect visitor 
orientation. Unfortunately, as with many new technologies, the cost of deployment is 
currently very high and requires the installation of mini-satellites covering the monitored 
space. Although in the vast majority of cases this technology would be prohibitively high for

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

In any case, use of UWB location-sensing technology produced highly accurate tracks 

 
most museums, it was actually used for a study conducted in 2009 at the Art Museum of St. 
Gallen, Switzerland.  This work was made possible by a research grant and participation by a 
leading manufacturer of such systems, and was available as a temporary installation rather 
than a permanent feature of the gallery.  
 
of visitors while also correctly identifying orientation within the galleries. Figure 5 shows 
several of the tracks recorded in a particular gallery, which reveal a uniquely detailed 
tracking and timing data set exceeding the capabilities of any alternative indoor or outdoor 
system (Tröndle et al 2013). The data and additional bio-sensed attributes (cf. Section 4 
below) have been successfully used to quantify the level of engagement with works of art 
and explore its relationship to social interaction during the visit. Although clearly this 
technology is still generally not yet affordable for museums, in the long term the availability 
of data at very high accuracy and detail opens up distinct opportunities for example, in 
tracking visitors interactions at the individual artefact level. The National Maritime Museum 
in Greenwich, UK is one of the sites conducting such experiments with a permanent 
installation of UWB in a single of its recently redeveloped galleries. 
 
5. Other Sensing Modalities 
To be sure, location sensing is the most readily available mobile sensing technology and 
suitable for extensive use in audience research, but several other sensing modalities 
currently at different stages of maturity, offer interesting opportunities. Firstly, 
smartphones typically carry a dozen or so sensors5 that can be used to capture a variety of 
personal and environmental information: high quality three- and six-dimensional 
accelerometers have been used to infer user activities for example distinguishing between 
periods of standing, sitting and walking in which case the speed and gait can be estimated. 
Microphones are of course ubiquitous in all phones and have been used to capture 
fragments of visitor speech which when processed by suitable algorithms can infer the 
emotional state of the speakers and their levels of stress. These techniques are rapidly 
reaching maturity and will soon become adequately dependable in audience research. 
In our London Zoo study, we employed proximity sensors to measure spatial density, 
 
which can be used to provide a good estimate of crowding levels. In other projects we have 
experimented with a variety of environmental and biological sensors such as those 
measuring air quality and pollution, noise, ambient radiation, temperature, humidity, heart 
rate and skin conductance, all of which are widely available at very low price. An interesting 
use of bio-sensing was employed in the St. Gallen study discussed above, where skin sensors 
were used to measure skin conductance which is widely believed to indicate the emotional 
state of the carrier. More recently, mobile electroencephalographs have become affordable 
as they have been commoditised as game controllers, and can be easily used to measure 
cognitive activity and responses to particular experiences. This trend is accelerating and it is 
reasonable to expect mobile sensing devices to become commonplace in the short term, 
although this is not to say that their use does not pose a challenge for audience research.  

 

Page 279 

A final point in the current discussion relates to the inference of social interactions in 

Volume 11, Issue 1 
                                        May 2014 

 
 
general and through the use of location or proximity data in particular. For example, when 
two or more visitors are tracked it is possible to deduce that they belong to the same group 
or that they are interacting at a particular time by observing the duration of their 
collocation. This heuristic has been successfully used in the study of social networks in a 
physical setting (Kostakos et al 2011) and is directly applicable for audience research. 
Typically, this requires the specification of a threshold on spatio-temporal co-presence that 
indicates that contact has occurred. There is further evidence to support this assumption 
and several related studies report success with this technique (Vu et al 2011).  
 
6. Methodological Considerations 
The design of any type of audience study is a balancing act whereby alternative 
methodologies must be weighed against the aims and research questions of the study as 
well as the time and resources available to complete it. While further practical experience 
with these technologies is crucial, we anticipate that the ability of mobile sensing 
technologies to collect Big Data sets from visitors at significantly reduced cost and effort 
makes large-scale and longitudinal studies decidedly easier to conduct. Technology may 
finally help overcome the financial barriers in conducting such studies, a long-standing but 
so far unattainable ambition of the field. The cost advantage of automating data collection 
and the BYOD approach in particular provide critical support for a shift away from project-
based studies as the main research approach, which is limited in that it only captures 
snapshots of short-term learning benefits while making cross-institution comparisons very 
difficult. Furthermore, these technologies can accelerate the data collection and analysis 
cycle thus facilitating evaluation studies where findings be fed back to the project team at 
very short time frames thus increasing the potential impact of formative evaluation studies 
especially in cases were rapid prototyping of sections or complete exhibitions is required.  
 
quality of data collected by a person and data collected automatically through technology. 
An attempt to explore this question specifically has been the work of Baldwin and Kuriakose 
(2009) that provides encouraging preliminary evidence in favour of the technology. 
Nevertheless, further studies are required to consider the details especially in fully 
developed settings that fully account for the realities of museum fieldwork.  
 
design of a successful study especially considering the implications of BYOD. First, it is 
necessary to install recoding software on the visitor’s mobile device. This is greatly 
facilitated by the widespread availability of software distributions mechanisms such as 
Google Play and the App Store, which allow the seamless and familiar methods for the 
installation of the required software. However, this process also involves the provision of a 
privacy and security policy by the research team, which should be in line with guidelines for 
ethical research, and in any case adds an extra layer of complexity to the project as research 
need to ensure that it is both sufficient and comprehensive. In particular, the research team 

From a practical perspective, there are several decisions that must be made for the 

One question that merits further consideration at this stage is the comparative

should be prepared to address visitor concerns about possible intrusions of their privacy 
noting that personal devices typically store highly sensitive information that should not be 
addressed. We discuss this issue further in the following section. 

The choice of the specific mobile location-sensing technology employed depends on 

Similar to other research tools their successful use requires that they serve the 

the particular physical setting for the study, and of course whether tracking will take place 
outdoors or indoors. For example, the physical attributes of the exhibits displayed have 
significant bearing on the required accuracy for successful tracking: where exhibits extend 
over a large area, such as in zoos, lower accuracy systems could work well. Object displays 
with high item density would require high accuracy location sensing to differentiate 
between them and at very high densities would stretch the capabilities of any system for 
questions relating to specific objects rather than the display as a whole. The same factors of 
physical layout also influence the interpretation of the collected observations, for example 
assessing the level of engagement with a display meaningful inferring interaction requires 
proximal presence for a period exceeding a minimum time threshold or confirmation of the 
visitor orientation.  
 
exploration of the questions set out the study. We anticipate that in the medium term while 
the technologies become more usable their most effective use will be in a mixed approach 
where technology-based data collection can be incorporated into a comprehensive 
methodology that derives from specific research questions. 
 
7. Implications for Research Ethics 
Research ethics are central in any study involving human participants, yet the type and 
volume of data that is possible to capture and process using these technologies raises 
distinct issues (see also Raento et al 2009 for an extended discussion of this question 
specifically). Naturally, the first step in ameliorating such concerns is to carefully draft the 
study information sheet so as to clearly explain what data is collected and how, how it will 
be processed and anonymized. In particular, at this stage of their development it is more 
likely that researchers involved in data collection may not be familiar with the full 
implications of the use of this technology and for this reason it is necessary to incorporate 
targeted training in understanding data collection in this manner as well as related methods 
for the effective protection of participant anonymity and dealing with privacy issues.  
 
and other sensitive information and despite security measures already in place it is not 
uncommon that such information can be accessed (maliciously or unintentionally) or that 
visitors perceive a risk in this possibility. Such concerns are not unfounded and are 
reinforced by high-visibility incidents widely reported in the public press. Prevention of such 
incidents requires firstly careful technical development where appropriate and also 
awareness of these risks by the research team so that appropriate action is taken when 
necessary. To this end, all research team members must have access to a set of practical 

Personal mobile devices, a core ingredient of BYOD, invariably contain confidential

The feature of Big Data analytics that appears to cause most concerns is the high 

 
measures in the event of visitors experiencing problems as well as appropriate training in 
troubleshooting common problems or at least taking appropriate action. 
 
volume and precision of observations captured over an extended period of time. This issue 
extends beyond audience research as the availability of mobile location sensing creates 
wider opportunities for its exploitation and for a more detailed discussion we direct the 
reader to Duckham (2011). In the short-term visitor tracking is most likely to occur over a 
single visit, which limits the potential exposure for the visitor, but in case where longer 
longitudinal studies are attempted these issues directly affect research design and must be 
carefully considered. Although there are readily available tools that apply strong 
anonymization algorithms to protect privacy in this context, though it appears that the 
process can be reversed using newly designed techniques based on data triangulation 
(Machanavajjhala and Reiter, 2012)  
 
8. Conclusions 
In this paper we have attempted to explore the costs and benefits of employing mobile 
sensing, the BYOD approach and Big Data analytics to audience research. We find that these 
technologies combined create novel tools that extend the depth and breadth of possible 
studies while considerably reducing their cost and their demands on specialist human 
resources. Specifically we discover the following advantages: 
 

    Reduced  effort,  time  and  cost.  Data  collection  via  mobile  sensing  using  the 
visitors’  own  mobile  phone  significantly  reduces  the  need  for  direct 
involvement  by  researchers  who  can  focus  on  the  management  and 
supervision of the process.  

    Increased  detail.  Using  mobile  sensing  technology  visitor  positions  are 
recorded precisely and with undivided attention on each observation for the 
duration  of  the  visit.  Recording  captures  all  behaviors,  not  only  those 
deemed  of  relevance  at  the  time  of  observation.  This  focus  on  detail  is 
maintained  over  prolonged  periods  of  time  without  fatigue  affecting  data 
collectors’ performance. 

    Advanced Analytics. Audience researcher can benefit from a new generation 
of  so-called  Big  Data  technologies  that  allow  the  application  of  advanced 
machine  learning  and  visualization  techniques  potentially  revealing  new 
patterns and behaviours, especially those evolving over time, that cannot be 
captured by descriptive statistics. 

 
We consider the collection of tracking data with smartphones as the first step in a 
comprehensive programme of research in the use of mobile sensing and Big Data analytics 
for audience research. Several research groups including the authors are currently

The suitability of mobile technologies for audience research is related to their ability 

 
experimenting with a variety of sensing modalities and in the sort-term we anticipate the 
use of these technologies to augment the current generation of tracking and timing studies 
with the presentation of location-specific questionnaires provisioned on the visitor 
smartphone relating to specific aspects of the exhibition and/or their experience in a highly 
targeted manner.  
 
to capture the physicality of the experience.  Nevertheless, museums are increasingly 
present online providing experiences beyond simple information related to visiting and 
increasingly incorporating social media, collaborative authoring and content sharing 
including audio, video, still images and text captured or published by visitors before, after 
and during their visit become more influential. The combination of the digital footprint 
created through participation in online activities and trails followed during visits in the 
physical setting can potentially be combined to create powerful insights into behaviour 
across the two settings. This approach can be further extended to incorporate other settings 
and resources, beyond the museum, that visitors use as they pursue their interests and 
which can highlight different pathways to interest development and strategies of self-
directed learning.

1 In this paper, we use the term ‘audience research’ to refer to ‘the study of actual and potential 
audiences of an institution through the use of a variety of methods’ (Visitor Behavior, 1998). In this

context, audience research covers different types of studies, ranging from large scale surveys and 
market research to audience participation and evaluation studies, using a wide range of theoretical 
and methodological approaches. We use the term ‘visitor’ to refer to individuals and groups visiting 
the physical space of the museum. 
2 Sensors are electronic or electromechanical devices that measure some environmental attribute 
and convert it into an electrical signal. For example an accelerometer, which is present in the vast 
majority of smartphones and mobile computers, behaves as a damped mass on a spring and uses the 
piezoelectric effect caused by the displacement of the mass caused by acceleration to produce a 
current. 
3 GPS is the longest running of all satellite-based location-sensing systems generally referred to as 
Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). Other GNSSs include GLONASS, a Soviet era system 
currently operated by Russia, that using incompatible technology to GPS; Europe’s Galileo and 
China’s Beidu are still in early stages of development and are not expected to be fully operational for 
several years. Neither provides variety of receivers, low cost or coverage comparable to GPS. 
4 The details of using such systems is beyond the scope of this paper and we direct the interested 
reader to the resources and tutorials published by the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (Open 
Source Geospatial Foundation 2014).. 
5 The interested reader is referred to Fraden (2010) for more details.
