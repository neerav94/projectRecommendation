Abstract.A large variety of digital content for smart mobile devices has entered 
the market. The demand for more diverse digital content has been accelerated 
through the implementation of an educational environment termed ‘Smart Edu-
cation’ in Korea. Digital content can be displayed on smart devices using a con-
tent  viewer  application.  However,  existing  contentonly  supportstatic  features, 
and do not support features that deliver analysis of big data. To address these 
shortcomings, here we propose a method for embedding dynamic educational 
content,which can be obtained frombig data analytics, into existing smart edu-
cational content.

Introduction 

There has been much growth in the use of smart mobile devices in recent years, and 
the range of digital content available on mobile devices has also grown at a consider-
able  pace.  The  electronic  book  (e-book)  industry  and  digital  textbooks,has  grown 
especially  quickly.E-books  and  digital  textbooks  can  be  viewed  on  smart  devices 
using a number of existing e-book viewersand content viewer applications. The most 
popular e-book viewers include Apple’s ‘iBooks 2’ and Readium’s‘Readium’. How-
ever, even though these support various features of the electronic publication format 3 
(EPUB3.0), neither these viewerssupport features to embed dynamic content based on 
big  data  analytics.  To  address  these  shortcomings,  we  have  developed  a  dynamic 
educational content viewer that can implement big data analytics and supports mul-
tiple device platforms. This educational content viewer was implemented as a part of 
the cloud-based smart education system[1,2]. For big data analytics[3,4], we usedHa-
doopMapReduce,  which  is  an  open-source  framework  for  processing  big  data.  We 
then  visualize  the  results  of  these  analytics  results  on  the  content  viewer  using 
SVG(scalable vector graphics).

Creating Dynamic Content based Big Data Analytics for a 
Cloud based Education System 

Many  academic  institutions  are  leveraging  cloud-based  technologies  to  support  ad-
vanced teaching and learning processes,as  well as to exploit the potential economic 
benefits. Cloud-based smart education systems have been developed by integrating a 
number  of  features  for  enhanced  e-learning  content  services.  Most  of  them  is  one 
developed by Jeong, et.al [2]. Figure 1 shows the infrastructure of the six main fea-
tures  required  to  support  cloud-based  educational  content  services  [8].  The  content 
viewer is designed to run on multiple device platforms, and supports a wide range of 
content. Specially, the content describing current state at a specific time such as cur-
rent  sales  volume  of  smart  phones,  can  be  included.  Clearly,  the  content  can  be 
changed over time, is called dynamic content, and is needed to be analyzed to sum-
marize  scattered  data.  In  this  paper,  we  describe  the  enlargement  ofthe  set  of  sup-
ported features by augmenting functions that deliver big data analytics, as shown in 
Figure 1. The big data analytics are visualized by seamlessly aligning the results the-
reof with other 2D and 3D objects.

results to a database and visualize them on the user’s screen using SVG.In the filter-
ing  process,  the  movies  to  be  counted  are  imported  to  maps  using  the  mapper,  the 
outputs of which are partitioned per reducer using the values with the same key. We 
can then obtain the number of comments on each movie by counting the occurrences 
of each keyword in the reducers. As many output files are created as the number of 
reducers.

Concluding Remarks 

This paper proposed a scheme for embedding dynamic content into smart education 
content, where dynamic content will be created through big data analytics. The pro-
posed  scheme  provides  for  teachers  to  more  convenientlycreate  dynamiccontent. 
Thestudy is ongoing, and more frequent dynamic content based onadvanced big data 
analytics will be investigated in future research through the expansion of a variety of 
content.
