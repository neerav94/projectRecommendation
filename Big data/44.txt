Participatory medicine: a driving force for
revolutionizing healthcare
Leroy Hood1* and Charles Auffray2*

Healthcare is undergoing a profound revolution as a
consequence of
three contemporary thrusts: systems
medicine [1-4], big data and patient involvement in their
own health through social networks. This convergence is
leading to a medicine that is predictive, preventive, per-
sonalized and participatory (P4) [4-7]. The first three Ps,
predictive, preventive and personalized, were delineated
in the early 2000s [1,2], whereas the fourth P, participa-
tory, was added later. To achieve a participatory health-
care system, major technical and societal challenges will
need to be overcome, and this will require close integra-
tion with systems medicine and big data. Before com-
menting further on participatory medicine, let us first
delineate the essence of systems medicine and big data
and their implications for P4 medicine.

Systems medicine, the application of systems biology
approaches to disease [3,4,6,8,9],
is already changing
how healthcare is practiced (Table 1). We predict that in
5 to 10 years each patient will be surrounded by a virtual
cloud of billions of data points - molecular, clinical
chemistries, cellular, organ, phenotypic, imaging, social
networks, and so on. We also predict that we will have
the analytical tools to reduce this big data cloud to sim-
ple models that will guide improvements in health and
minimize disease. This requires addressing two grand
challenges: the signal-to-noise issues intrinsic to big data
and integration of multi-scale data into predictive
models.

In addition, for each individual patient we foresee that
we will be able to integrate an individual’s genetic, mo-
lecular, cellular, organ and social networks into an over-
all
[10]. Disease leads to the
perturbation of the network of networks and this alters
the information the network manages. The availability of
a personal data cloud will allow one to characterize an

‘network of networks’

and other healthcare workers, other members of the
healthcare system (payers, providers), those concerned
with policy and implementation of healthcare, and those
involved with education of students and the general
public. Bringing all these participants into alignment
around P4 medicine is an enormous challenge.

mit the longitudinal analyses of disease or wellness states

These studies will provide insights into early disease mechanisms and will
provide new approaches to diagnosis and therapy

their feedback for guidance in developing new wellness
products and services? Our feeling is that these enor-
mous challenges can only be solved by employing
powerful IT tools, such as the massive online open
courses that are transforming the practice of higher edu-
cation, bringing it within reach of much larger numbers
of individuals [13]. Indeed, we submit that the IT for
healthcare of the future should include the means for
educating all participants.

Fourth, it is essential to educate patients regarding the
value of their data and how it can advance biomedical
science without injury to them. A key to the continuous
improvement of P4 medicine is the ongoing mining of
the personal data clouds of billions of individuals. For
this will allow rapid progress in our understanding of
the complexities of disease and wellness - and pro-
foundly change healthcare. Hence after appropriate de-
identification, it is essential that each patient’s data cloud
be available for mining for the predictive medicine of
the future. The narrow and restrictive institutional eth-
ical review board policies of today must be replaced with
open access to data for qualified professionals - with ap-
propriate protection for the individual.

Fifth, patient (consumer)-activated social networks will
play several important roles in assuring that patients will
be empowered to participate actively in P4 medicine.
Several such networks are already changing medicine,
and one example is the ’quantified self‘ networks that
have now spread widely in the United States. Individuals
in these networks use digital devices to measure their
own physical parameters (weight, pulse,
respiration,
quality of sleep, stress, and so on) and use them to

optimize health [14,15]. There are also many disease-
oriented social networks (for example, PatientsLikeMe,
Breast Cancer Alliance, Multiple Myeloma Research
Foundation) that are already beginning to alter how clin-
ical trials are carried out [5]. These social networks illus-
trate that healthcare and wellness can move away from
hospitals and into foundations and even the home. This
decentralization of medicine is an important aspect of
the emerging P4 medicine focus on wellness.

Sixth, our view is that patient-activated social net-
works will be one of the most powerful forces in driving
the acceptance of P4 medicine. Already patients are be-
ginning to question whether they want to have physi-
cians who do not know anything about their genomes,
or nutrition or wellness. Patients are beginning to move
to more recently trained physicians knowledgeable of
the new technologies and strategies that are transform-
ing the practice of medicine. A challenging question is
how to generate the patient-activated social networks
that will trigger the healthcare systems to accept P4
medicine.

Seventh, it is clear that the participatory aspect of P4
medicine is extremely dependent upon first class IT for
healthcare capable of managing and integrating millions
to billions of personal data clouds - that is aggregating,
mining, integrating them and finally producing models
for each patient that are predictive and actionable - thus
defining the future architecture of P4 medicine.
In
addition, it is essential that there be a ‘trusted third party
site’ that contains up-to-date and accurate information
on systems medicine and P4 medicine. Too often

information that has been obtained from the Internet.
There needs to be an accurate and trusted source of in-
formation -
for patients, physicians and healthcare
workers.

Eighth, it is clear that if the information from patient
data clouds is to be used effectively to optimize their
wellness and minimize disease, there needs to be a
trusted interpreter of these data clouds for each pa-
tient. It is our view that a new healthcare professional,
which we term a healthcare and wellness coach, will
need to be created who can look at the patient’s data
cloud and present it to them in a way that encourages
them to use their data to improve their health. We be-
lieve that nursing and general medical practice would
be an ideal starting background from which to train
such individuals.

The way forward
To take P4 medicine forward, we can learn from our ex-
perience of implementing systems medicine [16]. We be-
lieve that there are several paths forward.

First, we can create P4 pilot programs that recruit
large numbers of patients to use the principles of P4
medicine. At the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) and
the European Institute for Systems Biology and Medicine
(EISBM), we are in the process of initiating such pilot
programs focused on wellness - with many measure-
ments made over an extended time period of 10 to
20 years. These pilot programs will demonstrate the
power of P4 medicine to study wellness and wellness-to-
disease transitions while at the same time empowering
patients and engaging all healthcare system stakeholders.
For these programs, we need to develop an appropriate
IT framework,
learn to train healthcare and wellness
coaches, create effective and integrated data generation
platforms and pioneer the analytical tools that will allow
the creation of predictive and actionable models for each
participant’s data cloud. Wellness pilot projects are thus
ideal to join patients, physicians, consumers and other
people within the healthcare system.

Second, we suggest creating an Institute for Systems
Medicine at medical schools or academic healthcare in-
stitutions as a powerful way to bring the principles of P4
medicine to medical research,
training and practice.
Such an endeavor is an expensive but a transformational
opportunity. ISB has pioneered the creation of such an
institute
(the
Luxembourg Center for Systems Biomedicine) with great
success.

of Luxembourg

at

the University

Finally, one of the most powerful ways to push for-
ward the P4 agenda is to create effective patient (con-
sumer)-activated networks,
initially in the context of
wellness pilot programs.

Coda
The coming revolution in medicine is with us already
[6,12]. Several terms have been coined for this paradigm
change in healthcare - personalized medicine, precision
medicine and P4 medicine (systems medicine). Personal-
ized medicine alone does not delineate important
additional features of this revolution - the predictive,
preventive and participatory aspects. Precision medicine
is a poor term as big data - a central feature of P4 medi-
cine - is not (yet) precise. There are enormous signal-to-
noise ratio challenges. Moreover, precision medicine
does not properly describe any of the four central fea-
tures of the new medicine. We thus prefer the term P4
medicine because it captures the essence of this para-
digm change - especially the participatory aspect that we
have discussed here and see as central
to moving
forward with the revolution in healthcare and wellness.
Let us emphasize again in concluding that we see patient
(consumer)-activated social networks as one of
the
principle driving forces for the acceptance of P4 medi-
cine into the healthcare system. The challenge is how to
generate
effective patient-activated social networks
centered on the requirements and opportunities of P4
medicine [17].

Participatory medicine
Implementation of P4 medicine relies on achieving two
major objectives. First, the technical aspects of systems
medicine -
tools
-must be developed so that big data can be generated
and analyzed to reveal the dynamic networks for each
patient. The technical solutions to these challenges are
advancing very effectively. Second,
the societal chal-
lenges of P4 medicine must be solved - and in our mind
these represent far greater hurdles for the acceptance of
P4 medicine into healthcare systems [11]. These societal
challenges come in eight forms, as follows.

First, there are the obvious questions that relate to the
ethical, legal, societal, security, privacy, policy, regulatory
aspects and economics of P4 medicine that deal with in-
dividual patients. These have been discussed extensively
elsewhere [12].

Second, there is the fascinating and difficult question
of who is included in the term ‘participatory’. Obviously
patients must be included because a core idea of person-
alized medicine is that patients increasingly take control
of their own health. However, to integrate P4 medicine
into healthcare systems, we must also include physicians
and other healthcare workers, other members of the
healthcare system (payers, providers), those concerned
with policy and implementation of healthcare, and those
involved with education of students and the general
public. Bringing all these participants into alignment
around P4 medicine is an enormous challenge.

Third, ultimately bringing these participants

into
alignment will necessitate a change in education and
consumer feedback - how do we bring an appropriate
understanding of P4 medicine to all participants in the
healthcare system? And how do we systematically obtain

mit the longitudinal analyses of disease or wellness states

These studies will provide insights into early disease mechanisms and will
provide new approaches to diagnosis and therapy

their feedback for guidance in developing new wellness
products and services? Our feeling is that these enor-
mous challenges can only be solved by employing
powerful IT tools, such as the massive online open
courses that are transforming the practice of higher edu-
cation, bringing it within reach of much larger numbers
of individuals [13]. Indeed, we submit that the IT for
healthcare of the future should include the means for
educating all participants.

Fourth, it is essential to educate patients regarding the
value of their data and how it can advance biomedical
science without injury to them. A key to the continuous
improvement of P4 medicine is the ongoing mining of
the personal data clouds of billions of individuals. For
this will allow rapid progress in our understanding of
the complexities of disease and wellness - and pro-
foundly change healthcare. Hence after appropriate de-
identification, it is essential that each patient’s data cloud
be available for mining for the predictive medicine of
the future. The narrow and restrictive institutional eth-
ical review board policies of today must be replaced with
open access to data for qualified professionals - with ap-
propriate protection for the individual.

Fifth, patient (consumer)-activated social networks will
play several important roles in assuring that patients will
be empowered to participate actively in P4 medicine.
Several such networks are already changing medicine,
and one example is the ’quantified self‘ networks that
have now spread widely in the United States. Individuals
in these networks use digital devices to measure their
own physical parameters (weight, pulse,
respiration,
quality of sleep, stress, and so on) and use them to

optimize health [14,15]. There are also many disease-
oriented social networks (for example, PatientsLikeMe,
Breast Cancer Alliance, Multiple Myeloma Research
Foundation) that are already beginning to alter how clin-
ical trials are carried out [5]. These social networks illus-
trate that healthcare and wellness can move away from
hospitals and into foundations and even the home. This
decentralization of medicine is an important aspect of
the emerging P4 medicine focus on wellness.

Sixth, our view is that patient-activated social net-
works will be one of the most powerful forces in driving
the acceptance of P4 medicine. Already patients are be-
ginning to question whether they want to have physi-
cians who do not know anything about their genomes,
or nutrition or wellness. Patients are beginning to move
to more recently trained physicians knowledgeable of
the new technologies and strategies that are transform-
ing the practice of medicine. A challenging question is
how to generate the patient-activated social networks
that will trigger the healthcare systems to accept P4
medicine.

Seventh, it is clear that the participatory aspect of P4
medicine is extremely dependent upon first class IT for
healthcare capable of managing and integrating millions
to billions of personal data clouds - that is aggregating,
mining, integrating them and finally producing models
for each patient that are predictive and actionable - thus
defining the future architecture of P4 medicine.
In
addition, it is essential that there be a ‘trusted third party
site’ that contains up-to-date and accurate information
on systems medicine and P4 medicine. Too often

information that has been obtained from the Internet.
There needs to be an accurate and trusted source of in-
formation -
for patients, physicians and healthcare
workers.

Eighth, it is clear that if the information from patient
data clouds is to be used effectively to optimize their
wellness and minimize disease, there needs to be a
trusted interpreter of these data clouds for each pa-
tient. It is our view that a new healthcare professional,
which we term a healthcare and wellness coach, will
need to be created who can look at the patient’s data
cloud and present it to them in a way that encourages
them to use their data to improve their health. We be-
lieve that nursing and general medical practice would
be an ideal starting background from which to train
such individuals.

The way forward
To take P4 medicine forward, we can learn from our ex-
perience of implementing systems medicine [16]. We be-
lieve that there are several paths forward.

First, we can create P4 pilot programs that recruit
large numbers of patients to use the principles of P4
medicine. At the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB) and
the European Institute for Systems Biology and Medicine
(EISBM), we are in the process of initiating such pilot
programs focused on wellness - with many measure-
ments made over an extended time period of 10 to
20 years. These pilot programs will demonstrate the
power of P4 medicine to study wellness and wellness-to-
disease transitions while at the same time empowering
patients and engaging all healthcare system stakeholders.
For these programs, we need to develop an appropriate
IT framework,
learn to train healthcare and wellness
coaches, create effective and integrated data generation
platforms and pioneer the analytical tools that will allow
the creation of predictive and actionable models for each
participant’s data cloud. Wellness pilot projects are thus
ideal to join patients, physicians, consumers and other
people within the healthcare system.

Second, we suggest creating an Institute for Systems
Medicine at medical schools or academic healthcare in-
stitutions as a powerful way to bring the principles of P4
medicine to medical research,
training and practice.
Such an endeavor is an expensive but a transformational
opportunity. ISB has pioneered the creation of such an
institute
(the
Luxembourg Center for Systems Biomedicine) with great
success.

Finally, one of the most powerful ways to push for-
ward the P4 agenda is to create effective patient (con-
sumer)-activated networks,
initially in the context of
wellness pilot programs.

Coda
The coming revolution in medicine is with us already
[6,12]. Several terms have been coined for this paradigm
change in healthcare - personalized medicine, precision
medicine and P4 medicine (systems medicine). Personal-
ized medicine alone does not delineate important
additional features of this revolution - the predictive,
preventive and participatory aspects. Precision medicine
is a poor term as big data - a central feature of P4 medi-
cine - is not (yet) precise. There are enormous signal-to-
noise ratio challenges. Moreover, precision medicine
does not properly describe any of the four central fea-
tures of the new medicine. We thus prefer the term P4
medicine because it captures the essence of this para-
digm change - especially the participatory aspect that we
have discussed here and see as central
to moving
forward with the revolution in healthcare and wellness.
Let us emphasize again in concluding that we see patient
(consumer)-activated social networks as one of
the
principle driving forces for the acceptance of P4 medi-
cine into the healthcare system. The challenge is how to
generate
effective patient-activated social networks
centered on the requirements and opportunities of P4
medicine [17].
